    "synopsis": "Ten-year-old Chihiro and her parents move to a new home. After a wrong turn, they enter an abandoned theme park via a tunnel; her parents eat food there and transform into pigs. Chihiro must navigate a spirit world to save them. She meets a boy who warns her to leave before dark, then is guided to a bathhouse run by Yubaba, who contracts with Chihiro to work there and strips her name from Chihiro to Sen. Chihiro/Sen befriends Lin and Kamaji, learns to work in the bathhouse, and encounters diverse spirits, including a river spirit purified by cleansing and gold-seeking No-Face. She discovers her parents remain pigs, finds Haku, a dragon who helps her, and uncovers Yubaba’s control over people via names. After injuries and betrayals, Chihiro escapes with the help of Zeniba, Yubaba’s twin, who teaches forgiveness and responsibility. Chihiro returns to the human world, rescues her parents, and, having grown through resilience, crosses the river back to safety with a promise to meet Haku again in the future.",

      "ten-year-old chihiro (voice: daveigh chase in the 2002 english dub) and her parents (voices: lauren holly and michael chiklis ) drive to their new home. chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. in sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. the road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. it gives chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around. after wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food-though it's mysteriously deserted. mom and dad are hungry and start eating, despite chihiro's objections. the food is delicious, and chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. she finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. she meets a boy (voice: jason marsden ) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating-and they've turned into pigs. strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. as a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent. the riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume-or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks. chihiro thinks shes dreaming, but can't wake up. the boy who warned her away finds her and tells her she must eat some food from his world or she'll fade away. he assures her that she won't turn into a pig. she swallows the morsel he gives her and becomes solid, but finds that she's stuck to the ground until he recites an incantation to release her. a bird with a woman's head flies above them and he hides her, saying the bird is looking for her. they run through alleys and the pig barn to the big bathhouse, which is accessed by a bridge; the boy says she has to hold her breath as they cross the bridge or the spell that makes her invisible will be broken. customers-fantastically varied gods and spirits-are crossing the bridge and being greeted by bathhouse staff. chihiro makes it almost all the way across, but a frog (voice: bob bergen ) that speaks to her companion (calling him haku) startles her and she takes a breath. luckily only the frog seems to see her, and haku uses magic to encase it in a bubble to shut it up. haku tells her to find kamajii (voice: david ogden stiers ), the boiler man, and make him give her a job; she must have a job to stay at the bathhouse, or else yubaba (voice: suzanne pleshette ), the old witch who rules the bathhouse, will turn her into an animal. and haku says she has to stay if she wants to find and help her parents, who are still pigs, wherever they are. he knows her name and says he's known her since she was very small. chihiro descends a steep, winding, rail-less wooden stairway in search of kamajii and the boiler room. when she finds them, she sees a weird set-up in which the boiler is fed by creatures like spiders (delivering coal one lump at a time) and the machinery is controlled by a bearded, bald man with six arms and dark glasses-kamajii. she asks for a job, but he says-after grumbling about four bath tokens at once, as four red plaques on purple ribbons descend from the ceiling-that he's cast a spell on sootballs (the spider-things) so he has all the workers he needs. chihiro has to keep moving to stay out the way of kamajii and the sootballs. she picks up a lump of coal that's too heavy for the sootball carrying it-and almost too heavy for her-and kamajii tells her to finish what she started, so she hauls it over to the furnace and tosses it in. all the sootballs pretend to collapse under the weight of their coal so they won't have to work, but kamajii scolds them and chihiro, saying that if they don't keep working, the spell will wear off. a young woman comes in with food for kamajii and the sootballs. the woman is shocked to see chihiro-\"you're the human everyone is looking for!\"-but kamajii says she's his granddaughter and asks the woman to take chihiro to yubaba, who will give her something to do. the woman, whose name is lin (voice: susan egan ), only agrees when kamajii offers her a roasted newt; she brusquely tells chihiro to leave her shoes and socks behind and to thank the boiler man-\"he's really sticking his neck out for you.\" they take three elevators to yubaba's rooms on the top floor, seeing many of the bathhouse's clients-lin calls one a radish spirit-between elevators. an elevator operator who hasn't spotted chihiro tells lin she smells just like a human. lin distracts him with the roasted newt that kamajii gave her while chihiro escapes in the last elevator with the radish spirit. they arrive at a courtyard-like room with a mosaic floor and two big front doors; chihiro tries to open one. the door knocker says, \"aren't you even going to knock? you're the most pathetic little girl i've ever seen!\" the doors open and the same voice ( suzanne pleshette )-it's yubaba-tells her to come in; she's pulled through the house into a fire-lit room in which several disembodied green heads bounce around, and yubaba, an old woman with a huge head, works at a desk. chihiro asks for a job, but yubaba calls it foolishness, makes disparaging remarks about chihiro, and silences her with magic. she smokes a cigarette as she considers what to do with chihiro. she lifts the silencing spell to ask chihiro who helped her, but chihiro only continues to ask for work, which makes yubaba angry. when chihiro persists, yubaba offers, \"maybe i'll give you the most difficult job i've got and work you until you breathe your very last breath.\" they're interrupted when yubaba's enormous baby, bôh (voice: tara strong ) wakes up, which yubaba blames on chihiro. chihiro keeps asking for work and yubaba finally agrees to give her a job if she'll be quiet. chihiro signs a contract while yubaba grouses, \"i can't believe i took that oath to give a job to anyone who asks.\" yubaba, observing that chihiro is a pretty name, magically lifts all but one of the characters of chihiro's name from the contract and says that the name belongs to her now. reading the one character that remains of chihiro's name, yubaba says \"from now on, your name is sen.\" haku (pretending not to know her) comes to show her what to do. he says she must address him as master haku. none of the workers want to take chihiro/sen into their department, complaining that she smells bad, but haku says her smell will be gone after three days of eating their food. haku assigns chihiro/sen to work with lin because lin had been asking for an assistant. lin takes sen to their room, which they share with several others, and gives her clothing (a blue apron and pink shirt and pants). sen asks if there are two hakus. lin says no, and that sen must be careful what she says to haku because he's yubaba's henchman. sen doesn't feel well. yubaba turns into a bird with a human head and flies off her balcony with a smaller but otherwise identical human-headed bird. as sen lies sleeping among her new coworkers, a voice (haku's) says \"meet me at the bridge; i'll take you to your parents.\" she wakes up, dresses in her new clothes, and goes down to the boiler room where she left her shoes. when she observes \"my shoes are gone,\" the sootballs bring them out of the tunnels where they live. sen makes her way out to the bridge, where a semitransparent spirit is standing. it wears a white mask and a black robe. silently, it watches her cross; it was standing in the same spot in the middle of the bridge when she crossed the night before. haku finds her at the other side and leads her through flowering shrubs to the huge piggery. he says she must never come there without him. she identifies a couple of sleeping pigs-there are hundreds-as her parents, and promises to help them. haku says she must remember which pigs are her parents. he gives her back her old clothes, which she'll need to escape, and a card with her real name, chihiro, which sen has almost forgotten already. (she called herself sen when she spoke to her parents.) haku says yubaba exerts power over people by stealing their names; she must not forget hers as he has forgotten his. he gives her something to eat. she cries as she eats and he tries to comfort her. then haku has to go; he leaves her at the bridge. when she turns back to look for him, she sees a dragon flying away and realizes that it's haku. later, kamajii finds sen asleep on the floor of the boiler room; he covers her up. yubaba-bird and her smaller companion fly home through heavy rain. inside the bathhouse, lin asks sen where she was; sen apologizes but doesn't explain. sen, lin, and other girls wash a floor until a man comes to say they get the big tub today, though the women don't usually get that kind of work-\"that's frog work,\" as lin says. as sen dumps her pail out the garden door, she sees the silent spirit from the bridge standing outside in the rain looking in. she asks if he's getting wet and leaves the door open for him; he follows her in. they discover that the big tub is encrusted with crud and will need to be soaked before they can clean it properly, so lin sends sen to the foreman (voice: john ratzenberger ) for an herbal soap token. far above in her apartment, yubaba senses something approaching. she looks out and wonders who is slinking around in the rain. a spirit that looks like a pile of mud is making its way toward the bathhouse. the foreman refuses to give sen a soap token, but the silent spirit liberates one for her. as they fill the big tub to soak it clean, lin says the water contains salts that are supposed to be good for you. the silent spirit (voice: bob bergen again) approaches sen and offers a handful of soap tokens. (he's not completely silent; in this scene he makes little \"ah ah\" sounds, as if he's trying to talk.) when she politely turns them down, he seems disappointed and lets the tokens fall to the floor. she's distracted when the big tub overflows. meanwhile, yubaba has identified the walking mudpile as a stink spirit, though she's suspicious that he isn't really. the staff fails to fend him off, so yubaba assigns sen to take him to the big tub and bathe him. sen can hardly speak because he smells so bad. he's surrounded by a pool of purple stinkiness. he gets in the big tub, which overflows with his brownish slime. yubaba and the foreman watch as sen tries to clean the stink spirit. she uses the silent spirit's herbal soap tokens to order up some good, cleansing hot water. as lin arrives to help, sen feels something like a thorn in the stink spirit's side. yubaba decides this is important and gives sen rope to tie to the thorn (which has a handle); with help from all the staff, they pull a bicycle out of the spirit's body, followed by an entire junkyard. ( hayao miyazaki has said that this part of the story is autobiographical-he once pulled a bicycle out of a polluted, litter-clogged river.) when the slime clears, an ancient-looking brown face with shaggy eyebrows appears and says \"well done\" to sen. he seems to disappear, leaving her with a handful of something greenish. then he explodes out of the tub like a giant white snake-or perhaps a dragon (he resembles haku's dragon form)-and flies away, leaving lots of gold behind. yubaba is delighted. the guest was a river spirit in distress, not a stink spirit. sen sees the silent spirit sitting in the corner, apart from all the excitement. at bedtime, lin and sen sit on their balcony eating dumplings. when sen asks about haku, lin says the word is he does yubaba's dirty work. they watch a train go by on the water. (or so it seems; with all the rain, the water has risen so it just covers the tracks.) lin says she has to get out of that place-\"someday i'm getting on that train.\" sen tastes the green stuff the river spirit gave her, but finds it very unpleasant. that night, the frog who first saw chihiro on the bridge goes into the room with the big tub and meets the silent spirit, who lures him closer with little gold nuggets. the spirit eats the frog, and thereafter uses his voice. he asks another employee for food and pays with more gold, which seems to grow in his hands as needed. sen takes the river spirit's gift to the piggery, thinking it might turn her porky parents human, but she can't tell which pigs are her parents. back at the bathhouse, lin shows sen a lump of gold from \"a new guest here who's loaded.\" the formerly silent spirit is eating everything the staff can bring him, growing larger and uglier, and dispensing gold. sen goes to look for haku. a white dragon that sen recognizes as haku flies across the water, lands with a splash, and then seems to be attacked by white birds. sen opens her balcony doors so the dragon can fly into her room and closes the doors on the birds, which turn out to be made of paper. the dragon is bleeding, but flies out and up to a higher window. sen, worried, goes after him; one of the paper birds attaches itself to her back. she runs into the formerly silent spirit, who is glad to see her and offers her gold; she declines and the spirit, disappointed again, drops the gold, which is eagerly snatched up by the other employees. the spirit eats the staffer who was conducting him through the halls and another employee. has sen's rejection of his gifts turned him evil? sen finds herself climbing up the outside of the towering bathhouse. she notices that she has some of haku's blood on her hand. the paper bird moves from her back to her hair; sen turns to see the yubaba-bird flying back into her rooms at the top of the bathhouse. sen tries to get in through a window; the paper bird slips through and unlocks it for her. she goes through a bathroom down a hall to a playroom, where the paper bird enables her to hear yubaba, who complains into the phone that the problem guest is a no-face spirit who's eating people and that haku is bleeding all over the carpet. she callously tells someone to \"get him out of here-he'll be dead soon anyway.\" yubaba comes to the playroom (where sen is still hiding) and digs through the cushions to find the big baby. when yubaba leaves, the baby, bôh, grabs sen and accuses her of being a germ from outside, come to make him sick. (he never leaves his room so he won't get sick.) he threatens to break her arm if she won't play with him, so she shows him haku's blood on her hand-\"germs!\"-and he lets go. sen goes out to the main room, where haku lies bleeding in dragon form. bôh follows and again demands that sen play with him. the paper bird turns into a woman who looks just like yubaba. she turns the baby into a mouse when he mistakes her for his mother. she also turns the smaller yubaba-bird into a tiny, bug-like bird and turns the three green heads into a facsimile of the big baby. the woman explains she's zeniba (voice: suzanne pleshette again), yubaba's twin sister. she says haku stole her magical golden seal, and she wants it back. the seal carries a curse that zeniba says will kill anyone who steals it. she says he's a thief-he not only took zeniba's seal, but plans to steal yubaba's magic as well. haku snaps his tail and shreds the paper bird, which is lying on the rug; this action slices zeniba in half from top to bottom. \"oh ho, a paper cut,\" she remarks as she falls apart. haku and sen fall through a hole in the hearth down a long shaft, almost landing among some evil-looking spirits before haku, still in dragon form, revives enough to fly them to the boiler room. once there, haku collapses; he's still bleeding. kamajii says it looks serious-he seems to be bleeding from the inside. sen makes him eat part of the river spirit's gift. he thrashes and struggles and spits up zeniba's gold seal and a black slug, which sen steps on and kills. haku changes back to human form, but he's still ill and unconscious. sen takes the seal. kamajii says haku, like chihiro, appeared at the bathhouse out of nowhere and became pale-faced and steely-eyed once yubaba took him as her apprentice and got control of him. he thinks zeniba might be able to help if sen asks, though zeniba is very dangerous; sen agrees. she says haku helped her, and now she wants to help him. \"i guess my parents will have to wait,\" she says a little glumly. lin comes to say that the silent spirit is a monster called no-face who has swallowed three people; sen admits that she let him in, though lin implies she'll get in big trouble for it. kamajii gives sen train tickets-a rare treasure-to go to zeniba's house at swamp bottom. he says the train only runs one way now, though it used to go in both directions; sen will have to walk back along the tracks. when lin wonders what's going on with sen and haku, kamajii says \"something you wouldn't recognize. it's called love.\" meanwhile, no-face is calling for sen. yubaba tells sen to get every last bit of gold out of no-face, who has grown huge and bloated, before evicting him from the bathhouse. before sen goes in to see no-face, yubaba asks \"what's that dirty mouse doing here?\"-she doesn't recognize the mouse as her baby. no-face offers sen gold again, confiding, \"i'm not giving it to anybody else.\" she tells him she wants to leave because she has somewhere important to go, and that he should leave too because yubaba doesn't want him in the bathhouse. she asks if he has somewhere to go. he doesn't; he complains that he's lonely. no-face says he wants sen-meaning he wants to eat her. she makes him eat the remainder of the river spirit's gift instead, and it causes him to vomit uncontrollably (on yubaba, at one point). sen runs away and gets him to follow her down many flights of stairs. at the foot of the stairs, no-face coughs up a couple of the people he ate (who seem fine), and says \"i'll get you for this, sen.\" he shrinks down to his original size. lin turns up in a tub-like boat to take sen to the train station. sen calls no-face to follow her to the train, saying he needs to get out of the bathhouse because it's making him crazy. she's sure he won't hurt them. no-face coughs up the frog, who swims away. the train comes; sen and no-face go aboard, sen presents their tickets to the conductor, and they ride to swamp bottom, where zeniba lives. many of the passengers are transparent, and no-face has reverted to transparency as well. the mouse (formerly the baby) and the bug-bird are with them. the train travels over a landscape that's nearly all water. in the boiler room, haku wakes up and wakes kamajii, who explains that sen has gone to zeniba's and that she broke zeniba's spell and cured him with the power of pure love. in yubaba's room, the faux big baby (actually the three green heads) is eating while yubaba sits nearby with some of no-face's gold. haku comes in and says that something precious to her has been replaced; when yubaba looks closely, the baby turns back to the three heads and the gold turns to dirt. haku says, \"the baby is with your sister.\" yubaba asks what he wants to get the baby back. yubaba must tear up sen's contract and return her with both parents to the human world, haku replies. yubaba agrees, but only if sen can pass a final test. \"if she fails, she's mine!\" sen and no-face get off the train and go looking for zeniba. there's a dry path to walk on. the bug-bird and the mouse take turns carrying each other but get tired, so sen lets them ride on her shoulder. a hopping lamppost leads them through the dark to zeniba's house. the door opens and zeniba brusquely invites them in. zeniba still looks just like yubaba. she invites them to sit while she makes tea. sen gives back the golden seal and apologizes for haku. zeniba says \"he sliced me in two, you know, and i'm still angry.\" sen thinks she's talking about the slug, which she admits to having squashed, but zeniba says the slug was how yubaba controlled haku. only love could have broken zeniba's spell. zeniba says the spell on the mouse and the bug-bird wore off long ago and they can change back whenever they want. they're busy with a spinning wheel, however, and show no interest in changing. zeniba says sen must help her parents on her own; to do that, she must remember where she first met haku.\nshe asks sen to call her granny. (zeniba has become quite kindly.) no-face spins and the mouse and bug-bird knit a hair-tie for sen; zeniba says it will protect her because her friends made it for her. the door rattles and zeniba tells sen to let in another guest: it's haku in dragon form. zeniba says she'll forgive haku if he takes care of sen. zeniba asks no-face to stay with her-\"i need a good helper\"-and no-face agrees. sen tells granny her real name, climbs on haku's back with the mouse and bug-bird, and they fly off. as they fly, she remembers dropping her shoe in a river when she was very small, going in after it and fearing she would drown, but the river carried her to shore. it was the kohaku river. haku is the kohaku river spirit, and can't find his way home because the river has been filled in. haku changes from dragon to human, and for a while they enjoy free fall. sen and haku fly in human form, landing at the bathhouse bridge. the mouse turns back to a baby, who speaks up on sen's behalf. yubaba wants to give sen the final test, though the baby objects, but sen agrees that \"a deal's a deal.\" the test: sen must pick out her parents from a crowd of pigs. \"you get one try; if you get it right you can all go home.\" sen says none of the pigs are her parents; she passes the test and her contract evaporates out of yubaba's hand. saying \"thanks for everything, granny\" (which surprises yubaba, because she never asked to be called granny), sen runs off with haku, who tells her her parents are on the other side of the river. she has to cross the riverbed and not look back until she's through the tunnel. he'll go back to yubaba, though no longer in her thrall because he knows his name again. he promises that he and sen will meet again. sen-now chihiro-hears her parents calling and rejoins them near the tunnel mouth; they're fine and don't remember any of what happened. they scold her mildly for running off. when they get back to their car, it's dusty and covered with leaves, as though it had been there for a long time. as they drive away, dad says \"a new home and new school-it is a bit scary.\" chihiro, much matured since her last car ride, replies, \"i think i can handle it.\""

    "synopsis": "Grieving Annie Graham, miniature artist, navigates a series of cryptic deaths and visions after her mother Ellen’s funeral. Charlie, Annie’s daughter, experiences disturbing visions and strange public disclosures; Ellen’s death and Charlie’s headlong tragedy trigger a cascade of occult discoveries. Annie uncovers a family pattern of dissociation, grief, and a coven-linked history; Joan introduces séances and a method to conjure the dead using personal heirlooms, incantations, and a full family presence. Charismatic inexplicable events escalate: a bird dies headless, Charlie experiences visions of a grandmother enshrouded in fire, and Charlie mutely clucks during trance episodes. At a party, Charlie’s anaphylactic attack leads to her decapitation; Peter’s panic, sleep disturbances, and visions intensify as he suspects a malevolent, inherited force. Annie’s sleepwalking and a ritualized séance sequence reveal a link to a demonic order, symbolized by the god-king Paimon and a coven’s rites. Ellen’s headless corpse, Annie’s escalating madness, and Peter’s increasing possession culminate in a climactic attic ceremony: a headless mother and headless grandmother bow before a Paimon statue; Peter is crowned as the demon’s earthly vessel, while the tree-house dolls and the coven seal foretell an ongoing, transferal ritual beyond the family’s collapse.",

      "the story begins with the viewer looking out from a window in a workshop to a tree house, then turning and zooming in to a bedroom in a dollhouse that is in the workshop. steve graham wakes his teenage son peter and 13-year-old daughter charlie for their 78-year-old grandmother ellen taper leigh's funeral. steve finds charlie sleeping in the tree house. steve's wife annie, an artist who sculpts miniature dioramas, delivers the eulogy at her mother's service. charlie makes a clucking noise while drawing a strange sketch during the speech. annie talks to charlie about ellen at bedtime that night. charlie claims that her grandmother always wished charlie were a boy. to annie's confusion, charlie also wonders aloud who will care for her now that ellen is dead. annie later sees a

bird's head. a woman across the street waves at charlie. annie begins researching apparitions. steve receives word from the cemetery that ellen's grave was desecrated, but he decides to not tell his

since he claimed it was a party related to their school. charlie experiences a vision of her grandmother surrounded by fire. charlie makes her clucking noise when she is shaken out of her trance. charlie tells annie that she wants ellen. annie forces peter to take charlie with him to the party. flustered at having to monitor his sister, peter blows off charlie so he can smoke marijuana with bridget and their friends. many of women at the party are wearing long flannel-style shirts. left unsupervised, charlie unknowingly eats chocolate cake containing a substance to which she is allergic. charlie begins choking as she experiences an anaphylactic reaction. peter carries his sister to his car and rushes her toward the hospital along a dark country road. charlie sticks her head out the window in an effort to breathe better. peter swerves to avoid an animal in the road. charlie is decapitated when her head violently hits a utility pole. after sitting and staring in entranced shock,

steve looks through charlie's sketchbook of drawings. peter experiences a panic attack while smoking marijuana, before biking home from school. peter arrives at home in the dark. annie grieves alone while sitting in the car in the driveway. annie drives to her grief support group meeting, but decides to turn around while still in the parking lot. it is dark when she arrives. however, before annie can leave, fellow group member joan spots annie and stops her to talk. after hearing about charlie's death, joan confides in annie about the loss of her own child and grandson. when annie returns home, steve makes a pass at her, but annie rebuffs him. annie sleeps in the tree house. peter hears charlie's clucking noise and sees what he thinks is a vision of his dead sister in his room, but it appears to be his own hoodie in the corner. annie visits joan at joan's apartment. annie tells joan about a sleepwalking incident in which she doused peter and charlie and herself from head to toe in paint thinner before waking up to find herself preparing to light a match. from her body language, annie implies that the matches were in her left hand and can of paint thinner in her right. annie explains that her relationships with her children were never the same afterward. steve finds annie constructing a disturbing diorama of the scene where charlie died. steve, annie, and peter have an awkward dinner during which annie blames her son for charlie's death. peter responds by reminding annie that she was the one who forced charlie to go to the party. annie runs into joan at an art supply store. joan excitedly explains to annie that she attended an open séance that changed her skepticism about psychics. joan tells annie that a medium was able to conjure her dead grandson louis and taught joan how to conduct a séance as well.\njoan has a chalkboard in the trunk of her car. joan invites annie over to witness a séance firsthand. joan seemingly makes contact with louis, who uses a glass and a chalkboard to communicate. joan assures annie that she can conduct a similar conjuring herself by using a personal item from the deceased, reciting a cryptic incantation, and making sure that her entire family is in the house during the summoning. annie hears a clucking sound while driving home afterward. annie wakes that night to find a swarm of ants leading to peter's dead body. annie wakes from a sleepwalking trance over her son's bed, prompting a conversation with peter. peter asks why annie is seemingly scared of him. annie involuntarily confesses that she never wanted to be peter's mother and tried to have a miscarriage. annie suddenly wakes to discover she was experiencing a vision within a vision. annie recites joan's incantation with charlie's sketchbook while steve and peter sleep. claiming she summoned charlie, annie excitedly wakes her husband and son for another séance. charlie seemingly possesses annie. steve snaps annie out of her trance by dousing her with water as peter cries from confused fright. during school, peter sees the same strange light that charlie previously saw in her bedroom. peter notices that his reflection looks back at him with a different expression. steve admonishes annie for peter becoming convinced that a vengeful spirit is threatening him. annie trashes her studio in frustration when she accidentally breaks a tiny model chair, after another voicemail from her gallery pressures her about providing new pieces. charlie's spirit supernaturally draws in her old sketchbook. peter sees a vision of his dead sister in the corner, and her head falls off turning into a recreation ball on the floor, before being choked in his bed. peter accuses his mother of sleepwalking and attacking him again. annie advises peter not to tell steve what happened. annie goes on to explain that something supernatural is happening in the house and she is the only one who can stop it. the window above peter's bed has a mark that looks similar to the one in charlie's classroom when struck by the bird. realizing that the spirit she summoned is malevolent, annie throws charlie's sketchbook into the fireplace. annie's arm mirrors the burning book by also catching fire, forcing annie to rescue the book. annie returns to joan for help, but no one's there and she does not go inside joan's residence. the camera shows us joan's place is decked out in witchcraft paraphernalia, including a photo of peter inside a ceremonial triangle and a symbol annie recognizes from family photos. annie learns that the symbol is associated with the demon paimon, one of the kings of hell. annie also finds photos of joan with ellen, revealing that joan and annie's mother were in the same coven devoted to gaining riches by conjuring paimon into a male body. annie discovers ellen's headless corpse in her house's attic. peter hears joan shouting, \"i expel you\" at him from a distance at school behind a fence. during class, peter hears charlie's cluck. peter acts possessed and suddenly bashes his head into his desk, snapping out of his trance with cries of terror and pain. annie stands in the pouring rain below the tree house with ellen's scrapbook, and we see that peter's room behind her in the real house does not exist. steve brings peter home. annie approaches the car, and is dry with no sign of the downpour. annie tells steve that ellen's corpse is in their attic, but it is now decapitated. annie also shows steve the photographs where joan and ellen are wearing the seal of paimon. annie explains that their family became cursed when she tried contacting charlie. annie also explains the connection to charlie's sketchbook, adding that steve needs to destroy it in order to save peter. peter sleeps in his room in the background and is not awakened by the conversation. disbelieving her wild claims, steve accuses annie of digging up ellen's grave. when steve refuses to burn the sketchbook, annie throws it back into the fire, even though she presumes doing so will kill her. instead, steve spontaneously combusts. with his possessed mother hovering in the corner above his bed, peter gets up to search the house. when peter leaves his room the ladder to the attic is withdrawn missing. peter finds his father's charred corpse. possessed, annie chases peter to the attic. the ladder to the attic is now down. annie jumps up and furiously pounds her head on the attic door after peter climbs the ladder and retracts it into the upstairs ceiling. in the attic, peter finds flies, candles, and a photo of his face with the eyes punched out. ellen's body is gone. annie suddenly hovers above peter before severing her own head. confronted by this horror and three undressed devil worshipers, peter jumps out the window. peter's head hits the ground below, which seemingly knocks him out. peter rises after the oddly glowing light seen previously hovers around his body. peter follows his mother's headless corpse as it floats into the tree house. an assembly of mostly devil worshipers in various states of undress greets peter inside the tree house. there is one woman with long hair in a bathrobe. charlie's decapitated head sits atop a statue of paimon. peter looks around with a dazed, flat expression and we're shown annie and ellen's headless bodies lie bowing on the floor, in front of the statue. joan's voice calls peter 'charlie' as a woman crowns him, but welcomes peter as paimon while the coven hails the demon's arrival. the story ends with a shot of a model tree house filled with dolls that look like peter, the coven, and the headless annie and ellen."

      "when ellen, the matriarch of the graham family, passes away, her daughter's family begins to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry. the more they discover, the more they find themselves trying to outrun the sinister fate they seem to have inherited. making his feature debut, writer-director ari aster unleashes a nightmare vision of a domestic breakdown that exhibits the craft and precision of a nascent auteur, transforming a familial tragedy into something ominous and deeply disquieting, and pushing the horror movie into chilling new terrain with its shattering portrait of heritage gone to hell.",
      "grieving miniature artist annie graham and her family prepare for ellen leigh's funeral--her unbearably complex and cryptic septuagenarian mother. but annie is oblivious to her 13-year-old daughter charlie's mounting distress and the relentless anguish of culpability her older brother, peter, begins to feel. as unsettling occurrences emerge in the dark corners of their secluded home, a sinfully pleasant sense of relief and guilt descends upon them. as a result, a sinister presence robs annie of her free will, demanding a cruel sacrifice in exchange for glorious rewards. will the grahams shake off the macabre connection to the unseen realm, especially when evil runs in the family?"

    "overview": "a middle-aged chinese immigrant is swept up into an insane adventure in which she alone can save existence by exploring other universes and connecting with the lives she could have led.",
    "synopsis": "Evelyn Wang, a middle‑aged Chinese American laundromat owner, faces a failing business, a strained marriage to Waymond, a visit from her judgmental father, and a looming IRS audit led by Deirdre Beaubeirdre. In a tense meeting, Waymond’s body is taken over by Alpha‑Waymond, who explains that countless parallel universes exist due to every life choice. Verse‑jumping technology lets Evelyn access skills, memories, and bodies of alternate selves. Jobu Tupaki, a shattered personality from another Evelyn, creates an everything bagel—a toroid singularity that could annihilate the multiverse. Evelyn slips into other realities, confronting careers and lives she might have led, while her original self remains in the IRS building, contending with Deirdre’s threat of fraud charges. The alphaverse deploys forces to stop Evelyn, who must defeat minions and reconcile with her own family. Across divergent worlds, she witnesses possibilities: becoming a kung fu star, a film star, or a version of herself who embraces nihilism. After a dramatic confrontation with Jobu, Evelyn’s mind fractures as she repeatedly verse‑jumps, ultimately choosing empathy, human connection, and compassion over despair. Guided by Waymond’s plea for kindness, she learns to confront meaninglessness with love, repairs relationships with Joy and Becky, and uses multiverse powers to calm the chaos, refile taxes, and save the day. The journey culminates in Evelyn embracing her imperfect life, repairing bonds with her family, and preventing the cosmic threat by grounding herself in her own universe while extending mercy to alternate selves.",

      "evelyn quan wang (michelle yeoh) is a middle-aged chinese american immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, waymond (ke huy quan); two decades earlier, they eloped to the united states and had a daughter, joy (stephanie hsu). in the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the internal revenue service (irs); waymond is trying to serve evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as gong gong (james hong), cantonese for 'grandfather') is visiting for her chinese new year party; and joy is dealing with depression and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes evelyn's reluctance to accept joy's lesbian relationship with her non-chinese girlfriend becky (tallie medel). at a tense meeting with irs inspector deirdre beaubeirdre (jamie lee curtis), waymond's body is taken over by alpha-waymond, a version of waymond from the \"alphaverse.\" alpha-waymond explains to evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. the alphaverse, led by the late alpha-evelyn, developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. the multiverse is threatened by jobu tupaki (alpha-joy), whose mind was splintered after alpha-evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. she has created a black hole-like \"everything bagel\" topped with everything, which appears as a toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse. alpha-evelyn made it the task of the alpha-verse to find the one who can stand up to jobu tupaki.\nwhile evelyn goes into a different universe, her body in the original universe stays, but her mind is not there. this happens during the audit meeting with deirdre and the meeting is not going well. she says evelyn is charging her hobbies as business expenses, and can be charged for fraud, or will have to pay a fine. in her confusion evelyn strikes deirdre during the audit who calls security. alpha-waymond appears again inside waymond's body and helps evelyn escape.\nthey are still trapped inside the irs building as dierdre from a tetra-verse appears inside dierdre's body and blocks their path. evelyn is given verse-jumping technology by alpha-waymond to fight jobu's minions, who converge on the irs building. she discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star; she also learns of waymond's plans with the divorce papers. evelyn uses her powers to defeat alpha-dierdre and the other minions. jobu tupaki directs all the minions to the irs building in the original evelyn's universe when she senses that evelyn has started gaining powers.\nalpha-waymond believes that evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat jobu. gong gong is taken over by alpha-gong gong, who instructs evelyn to kill joy to stop jobu from using her to enter evelyn's universe.\nevelyn refuses and decides to face jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. evelyn believes that the only way to defeat jobu tupaki is to become like her.\nalpha-gong gong, convinced that evelyn's mind has been compromised like jobu's, sends soldiers after evelyn. while they fight, jobu locates and kills alpha-waymond in the alphaverse. as jobu confronts evelyn in her universe (she shows evelyn the real bagel black hole and tells her that the real truth is that nothing matters), evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses. evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the evelyns that do not agree with her. she brings evelyn to the everything bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and evelyn to truly die. upon looking into the bagel, evelyn is initially persuaded, and acts cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her (she even signs the divorce papers with waymond and proceeds to destroy her own laundromat). as evelyn is about to enter the bagel with jobu, she pauses to listen to waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. in her home universe, evelyn reconciles with waymond, accepts joy and becky's relationship and tells gong gong of it, and talks with deirdre after waymond convinces deirdre to let them redo their taxes\nevelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow waymond's absurdist and humanist advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy and brings happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes alpha-gong gong and jobu's fighters.\njobu decides to enter the bagel alone while, simultaneously in evelyn's universe, joy begs evelyn to let her go. evelyn tells joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with joy. evelyn and the others save jobu from the bagel, and evelyn and joy embrace. some time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the irs building to refile their taxes. as deirdre talks, evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe."

      "with her laundromat teetering on the brink of failure and her marriage to wimpy husband waymond on the rocks, overworked evelyn wang struggles to cope with everything, including a tattered relationship with her judgmental father and daughter. and as if facing a gloomy midlife crisis wasn't enough, evelyn must brace herself up for an unpleasant meeting with an impersonal bureaucrat: deirdre, the shabbily dressed irs auditor. however, as the stern agent loses patience, an inexplicable multiverse rift becomes an eye-opening exploration of parallel realities. will evelyn jump down the rabbit hole? but how many stars are in the universe? can weary evelyn fathom the irrepressible force of possibilities, tap into newfound powers, and prevent an evil entity from destroying the thin, countless layers of the unseen world?",
      "evelyn wang is going through the motions of life in trying to achieve some sort of fulfillment, which she may or may not admit to herself has, so far, been unsuccessful at almost any level. she and her husband, waymond wang, own and operate a laundromat, and while she loved him when they were first married - marrying him against the advice of her judgmental father's - she now feels that he is a weak man whose messes she has to fix. on the flip side, she has no idea that he has had papers drawn for divorce, or that he only plans on going through with it as a last resort if things between them don't improve. she feels she has never really had the love or respect of her father - whom she ran away from as a young adult - and now he has come from asia to the us to live with her and waymond. evelyn and waymond's only offspring, young adult joy wang, has turned into a version of her by pulling away, not feeling any love or getting any respect, and as such, being aimless in life. what may be the pinnacle of the mother/daughter problems is that joy has not only brought her girlfriend becky into their lives - how to explain becky to her father and others like him; the biggest issue in the same sex vein - but becky is also white. conversely, evelyn's life could have been so much more if she made different choices or followed through with any of the many other things she started. on top of preparing for a chinese new year's eve party under the pressure of trying to meet the exacting standards of her father, she and waymond are also in the middle of an irs audit by their auditor, hard-nosed deirdre beaubeirdre. as evelyn and waymond enter into what is supposed to be their final \"show me the proper paperwork or else\" meeting with deirdre, evelyn physically and metaphysically enters into alternate universes, where she not only has to make the right choices to save the collective universe, but arguably more importantly, come to a true understanding of herself.",
      "evelyn wang and her husband, waymond, run a laundromat. times are tough, and they're in trouble with the internal revenue service. there's also some fuss with their daughter, and evelyn's father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. and now, waymond wants a divorce. could things have turned out differently for evelyn--maybe in a parallel universe?",
      "a middle-aged chinese laundromat owner must get in touch with her other selves who are scattered across the multiverse. this woman is the key to saving reality itself, but she can't do it alone; her family's fate is intertwined with the fate of the multiverse too."

    "synopsis": "Gotham endures a mob bank heist gone wrong, the Joker covertly exploiting the chaos to incite anarchy; Batman confronts him, while Harvey Dent and Jim Gordon coordinate a crackdown on crime. Batman tracks Lau in Hong Kong to recover mob funds and force Dent’s team to leverage a Rico case against the mob. Lau’s testimony leads to mass arrests, but the Joker retaliates with assassinations and public threats, forcing Batman to reveal his secret identity to protect those he loves. A hospital bombing and a two-firth finale push Dent toward vigilante justice as Two-Face, while Batman grapples with whether to expose himself, or let Gotham choose its own protector. The Joker destabilizes Gotham’s institutions, kills Rachel, disfigures Dent, and engineers a crisis that forces Gordon to sacrifice truth for the city’s fragile order; Batman ultimately captures the Joker, Dent’s legend complicates heroism, and Gotham’s leadership consolidates around Jim Gordon while Batman’s own fate remains hidden behind the mask.",

      "a gang of 6 criminals rob a gotham city mob bank and start murdering each other for a higher share. they suggest that a sixth member of the gang - nicknamed 'the joker' - who did the planning, but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. at the end, only the joker (heath ledger) remains, and he escapes with the money. joker is a psychopathic illegal mastermind portraying himself as an \"agent of chaos\", who rises from the criminal underworld by thrusting gotham into anarchy. gordon arrives at the bank the joker held up earlier with ramirez who shows him the joker's picture from a security camera. batman arrives to inspect the scene, noting that they have irradiated the drug money to make it easier to trace. when gordon asks him if the joker is a threat, batman informs him that he cannot worry about one man when there is an entire mob to bring down. batman (christian bale) is the alter ego of a billionaire socialite bruce wayne who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging at age 8, travels the world for seven years before returning home to operate as a bat-masked vigilante hailed as gotham city's \"dark knight\", using fear against the city's criminal underworld at night.\ndistrict attorney harvey dent (aaron eckhart) is hailed as gotham's \"white knight\", who is running a campaign against the criminal underworld.\nlieutenant jim gordon (gary oldman) of the police department works under the current police commissioner. gotham is then seen at night with criminals afraid to commit crimes under the watchful sign of the bat-signal projected onto the clouds. lt. james gordon mans the bat-signal, waiting for batman with det. anna ramirez (monique gabriela curnen), who asks if he's coming. gordon explains that it is okay if he is not, hoping that he is busy elsewhere. he asks about ramirez' mother, who's in the hospital. meanwhile, in a parking garage, the scarecrow (cillian murphy), still at-large after escaping arkham asylum, is negotiating with the russian mob members, led by the chechen, over the sale of some of his fear-inducing drugs. the sale is interrupted when some of gotham's citizens dressed as batmen wanna-be's begin shooting at the men. as he gases one of the fake batmen with his mind-altering drugs from his cuff, the scarecrow notes that they are not the real batman, because batman would never use a gun. suddenly the batmobile/tumbler crashes through a barricade. the batmobile, pre-programmed to \"loiter\" and then \"intimidate\", fires rockets into a nearby office, sending the remaining mobsters running. the real batman arrives and bends the rifle barrel of one of the wanna-be batmen before knocking him out. the chechen sends his rottweilers to attack the batmen, and as batman saves them he takes the dogs out after being badly bitten in the arm. the scarecrow attempts to flee in a white van but batman jumps onto the van and begins cutting into the side with his device called the mangler. scarecrow swerves into a support which sends batman to the ground. as scarecrow gets away down a spiraling passageway, batman leaps onto the roof of his van, smashing it to a halt. he leaves the fake batmen and the scarecrow along with some of the mobsters tied up together for the police to eventually round up. when one of the impostors says he's trying to help, batman harshly tells him he doesn't need any help. the next day, as bruce wayne stitches himself up from the dog bite. alfred (michael caine) notices bruce keeping a close watch on newly appointed district attorney harvey dent via some computer screens, as bruce is trying to decide whether or not dent can be trusted. alfred wonders if he is really spying on the relationship that rachel dawes has developed with harvey dent. harvey dent arrives in court to join rachel dawes in prosecuting mobster salvatore maroni (eric roberts), the alleged new leader of the falcone crime family. one of maroni's men takes the fall in court and attempts to shoot dent from the witness stand. the gun doesn't go off and dent punches the man before he is hauled off to jail. maroni is eventually set free, to the dismay of dent. dent meets lt. gordon, and after a short exchange of words, they both express their distrust for those that are working in each other's offices. harvey interrogates gordon over his involvement with the batman and harvey tells him he wants to meet him. gordon requests search warrants for five banks that are believed to be holding the remainder of the mobs money. dent agrees to back gordon's search warrants, forming a tenuous trust with the honest gordon. lucius fox holds a board meeting at wayne enterprises, negotiating an joint venture with lau, the head of lau security investments, based in hong kong. after the meeting with lau, wayne expresses his reservations with lucius fox about lau's business operation, apparently illegal based on their profits. after agreeing to cancel the deal, wayne asks fox for a new suit. he explains that he needs to be lighter, and faster, in case he runs into any more guard dogs and that he wants to be able to turn his head. that night, harvey dines out with rachel. harvey tells rachel he had to make a reservation weeks earlier, and even then needed to exercised his influence to get a table at the very fashionable restaurant. bruce and his date, the prima ballerina for the russian ballet, encounter rachel and harvey. bruce has them pull a table together so they can dine together, informing harvey that he owns the restaurant. at first, bruce seems jealous and threatened by harvey, based on the fact that he is dating rachel, but harvey explains how he supports the work of batman and appreciates his help. bruce changes his tune and informs harvey that he intends to throw a massive fund-raiser for him. bruce wayne is impressed with dent's idealism as dent has gone after every money launderer in the city and he knows that batman and gordon are going after the mob's money supply, and wants in.\nbruce offers to support his career; he believes that, with dent as gotham's protector, he can give up being batman and lead a normal life with rachel dawes (maggie gyllenhaal).\nrachel is gotham city's assistant district attorney and bruce's childhood friend, who is one of the few people who knows batman's true identity. although rachel and dent are currently dating. mob bosses sal maroni (eric roberts) (an italian mafia boss who takes over carmine falcone's mob), gambol (michael jai white) (an african american mafia boss in charge of illegal gambling and extortion for the mob), and the chechen (ritchie coster) (in charge of drug-trafficking for the mob) hold a video-conference with their corrupt accountant, lau (ng chin) (a corrupt chinese lsi holdings accountant triad boss), who has hidden their funds for safekeeping and fled to hong kong. lau says that gordon and dent have raided all the mob banks, but he moved the money before they could get to it. the money will be in hk where us authorities can't touch it. the meeting is interrupted by the joker, who warns them that batman is unhindered by the law (and alleges that lau would squeal to the police) and offers to kill batman in exchange for half of their money. the mob laughs, and as one of the mobsters, gambol, rises from his seat and threatens the joker, the joker opens his coat, exposing grenades. gambol tells the joker that he's putting a price out on his head. the joker tells the mob that when they plan to take things a little more seriously, give him a call, and presents them with 'his card', a joker playing card. and with that, he exits. but not before warning that batman will come for lau. gambol is playing pool with some of his associates until one of them informs him that a group of hoodlums have killed the joker, and has the body. the body is brought in covered in a bag, and as gambol is about to pay, the joker rises up and holds a knife to his face while his men hold guns to his associates' heads. the joker tells a story about how he got his scars from his father, and then kills gambol. batman has a meeting with gordon and dent and promises to bring back lau to us. batman finds lau in hong kong. bruce wayne's company was already investigating lau's company for a possible takeover bid, but in reality, bruce was just getting a good look at his books.\nfox shows wayne his new suit, and wayne begins planning an impromptu trip to hong kong. fox will accompany him, making it look like the only reason for his visit was to cancel the negotiations with lau's company. meanwhile, fox arrives in hong kong to meet with lau. he checks in his mobile phone at the front desk at lau's building, as there are no cell phones allowed on the premises. fox meets with lau, and informs him of wayne enterprises' plans to cancel negotiations with his company. however, he secretly keeps one cell phone in his pocket, which has been adapted to produce a sonar map of the surrounding area. upon leaving the building, he does not pick up the phone he dropped off, and he produces the map of the building to bruce wayne. that night, the phone that fox left at the front desk emits a high frequency that shuts down all power in the building. batman crashes in through a window in lau's office, and after a vicious fight with some of his guards, grabs lau and escapes by sending a balloon attached to a cable to a plane he has chartered flying over lau's building. batman brings lau back to gotham to testify by capturing lau in his hk office and using the cia's sky-hook project to bring him out, allowing dent to apprehend the entire mob. back in gotham, lau is interrogated by rachel with dent and gordon looking on. rachel presses him to give them the money lau has taken, but lau will not give in. after she threatens to have him moved to the county lock-up, lau tells her that he can give them the names of the mobsters and their pooled investments. dent then realizes that they will have the leverage they need in a rico case of conspiracy to link all of the mob members together. gordon decides to keep lau in his holding cell at the major case unit building and lau agrees to cooperate with the police and give the names of the mob members. gordon appears at maroni's restaurant as the police rush in to arrest all of the mob members in attendance. as all of the mob members that lau informed the police are rounded up for arraignment, judge janet surrillo finds a joker card in the middle of the stack of conviction papers. dent gives a televised impromptu interview denying batman's involvement while expressing gratitude for the police work in bringing the mob members to justice. the joker threatens a string of murders unless batman reveals his identity and starts by killing police commissioner gillian b. loeb (colin mcfarlane) and judge surillo, who is presiding over the mob trial. the judge's car blows up when the police arrive to take her into protective custody and commissioner loeb dies of severe poisoning from his liquor bottle before gordon can stop him from drinking. batman is able to save dent when joker attacks the fundraiser that bruce wayne had thrown for dent. the joker also targets mayor anthony garcia (nestor carbonell), but gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. joker infiltrates the police guard giving the 21-gun salute for the commissioner and aims his gun at the mayor. gordon spots this and comes in front of the bullet. dent learns that rachel is the next target. gordon's family is visited at home, to inform them of the death of gordon at the funeral ceremony. gordon's wife, barbara, shouts out at the empty sky to batman that he has brought this craziness upon gotham. gordon's young son catches a brief glimpse of batman mournfully watching the scene. bruce decides to reveal his identity. bruce arrives back in his penthouse to find rachel waiting. she tells him that turning himself in will not stop the joker's murderous rampage, but bruce says he has enough blood on his hands already. he reminds her that she promised him that they would be together if and when he hung up the mantle of batman. she tells bruce not to make her his only hope for a normal life and they share a kiss. she tells bruce that if he turns himself in as batman that the city will never let them be together. back at wayne's secret base of operations for batman, he and alfred begin destroying everything that might tie lucius fox or rachel to batman. alfred tries to talk bruce out of it, asking him to endure these trying times and allow batman to make the right choice that nobody else can for the good of the city. before bruce can reveal himself as batman dent announces that he is batman. rachel, watching the news conference at bruce wayne's penthouse, confronts alfred over bruce's seeming cowardice in allowing harvey to take the fall when he claims to be batman. alfred explains to rachel that batman is instead allowing himself to be something else besides a hero, mainly a figure outside of the system that the people can both turn to or blame in times of need, that batman can 'take it\". rachel gives alfred a letter for bruce and tells him to give it to bruce when the time is right. when alfred asks what it is, she tells him it is open and hugs him before departing to see harvey as he is being transported to the county lock-up. dent is taken into protective custody, but the joker appears and attacks the convoy. while transporting harvey, the joker and some goons start taking out the police cars in a large semi-truck. he pulls out an rpg and begins firing at the armored truck carrying dent. the tumbler arrives and attempts to stop the joker and is hit by one of the joker's rpgs. his car takes 'catastrophic' damage, and he's forced to eject. however, the ejection in this car is a bike, the batpod, that deploys out the front of the car. batman chases down the joker on his batpod, and after firing some cables at the truck and weaving them through some light poles and buildings, flips the truck completely over. the joker emerges with a smith & wesson m76 submachine gun and shoots at batman, who speeds towards him on his batpod, all the while screaming at batman to hit him. batman honors his own non-lethal code and swerves around the joker then crashes into the flipped truck, falling to the ground. as the joker jumps on him with a knife, one of the swat officers holds a shotgun to the back of his head, and upon removing his helmet and mask, shows that it was lt. gordon, who faked his death to protect his family. the joker is hauled away to the mcu. harvey gets out of the truck and into a cruiser, stating he is off to see a worried girlfriend.\nat gordon's major crimes unit building, gordon is promoted to commissioner by the mayor. rachel and dent are escorted away by detectives on maroni's payroll. gordon later learns that they never arrived home. batman interrogates the joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. batman races to save rachel, while gordon attempts to rescue dent. batman arrives at the site but realizes that the joker sent him to dent's location instead. both buildings explode, killing rachel and disfiguring half of dent's face. the joker escapes the lockup with lau (after he triggers a bomb that he had smuggled inside the stomach of another prisoner), whom he later kills along with the chechen (by setting them on fire along with the mob's money). lucius fox is the recently promoted ceo of wayne enterprises who, now fully aware of his employer's double life, serves more directly as bruce's armorer for the batsuit in addition to his corporate duties.\ncoleman reese, an accountant at wayne enterprises, claims to know about certain problems with wayne's funding in research and development, claiming that wayne has some sort of government project with cell phones for the army underway. he also uncovers fox's designs for the batmobile/tumbler. he wanted fox to pay him $10mm per year for the rest of his life to keep quiet. not wanting reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills reese within the hour. gordon orders the evacuation of all hospitals in gotham and goes to secure reese. the joker breaks into dent's hospital in the confusion and gives dent a gun and convinces him to seek revenge for rachel's death. he convinces dent to become an agent of chaos just like himself, then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. dent goes on a killing spree, as the vigilante two-face, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin-one side having been scorched in the explosion. he kills sal and the 2 corrupt cops whom he held responsible for rachael's death after announcing gotham will be subject to his rule come nightfall, the joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives, one containing ordinary folks and the other containing prisoners. he threatens to blow them both up by midnight but will let one ferry live if its passengers (who have been supplied the detonator to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. batman finds the joker by exploiting the sonar capabilities of all phones in the city, with the reluctant help of lucius fox (morgan freeman). fox says that he will resign from his post after this assignment. both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while batman apprehends the joker after a brief fight. joker was hiding in a building and had disguised all the hostages as his henchmen, with guns taped to their hands and wearing masks. batman saves all hostages from gordon's swat teams before apprehending joker. before the swat arrive to take the joker into custody, he gloats that gotham's citizens will lose hope once dent's rampage becomes public knowledge. gordon and batman arrive at the building where rachel perished, and encounter two-face, who has kept gordon's family as hostages. two-face shoots batman, and threatens to kill gordon's son, claiming that gordon's negligence is responsible for rachel's death. before he flips his coin for the boy, batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles two-face off the building to his death. batman persuades gordon to hold him responsible for the killing spree and preserve dent's heroic image. dent is hailed as a hero and the police launch a manhunt for batman. gordon destroys the bat-signal, fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and alfred pennyworth (michael caine) burns a letter from rachel saying she planned to marry dent (she had given this letter to alfred before her death)."

    "synopsis": "Jesper, an underperforming postal academy student, is exiled to the fogbound island town of Smeerensburg to post 6,000 letters. The feuding El l ingboes and Krums barely interact; a cold post office and wary locals set the stage. Jesper encounters Alva, a former teacher turned fishmonger, and hides from a reclusive woodsman, Klaus, who lives in a toy-filled cabin. After a failed escape, Klaus forces Jesper to deliver a toy to a boy, spreading curiosity. Word spreads; children write to Klaus, asking for toys. Klaus agrees to deliver at night if Jesper helps; more children write letters, and Alva reopens her school. As toys proliferate, Margu, a Sami girl, inspires Jesper to learn to write a letter asking for a sled, which Klaus helps build with Jesper. Klaus reveals he made the toys for future children they never had with his late wife Lydia, and the Christmas plan gains momentum. External pressure from the feuding families escalates until their parents sabotage the effort, but a staged deception by Alva and the children allows decoys to replace the gifts. Magdalena and Olaf’s budding romance accelerates reconciliation, and a Christmas delivery culminates in the town’s redemption. Jesper’s father, convinced he’s failed, arrives but witnesses his son’s remorse and allows him to stay. Klaus vanishes for a year, then returns each Christmas Eve to deliver toys worldwide, while Jesper and Alva marry, raise two children, and continue the goodwill tradition for years to come.",

      "jesper (jason schwartzman) is the lazy and unambitious son of a postmaster general, who deliberately under-performs at his father's postal academy. jesper does not take the academy seriously and even undermines the authority of the drill sergeant (j. k. simmons) the assistant head of the johansen family's postal department who works under the royal postmaster general.\njesper had spent 9 months at the academy and learned nothing at all. jesper was not good at sorting / filing, carrier pigeon handling, transport of fragile merchandise, among other things. in a final effort to get his son to change his behavior, his father sends him to the distant island town of smeerensburg with the task of posting 6,000 letters in a year, and if he fails, he will be cut off from the family estate. that would be the end of jesper's privileged life, and he would end up in the gutter.\njesper travels by coach to the end of the mainland and the only way to get to smeerensburg is to take a ferry. the island is surrounded in fog, and it is miserably cold. once there, it becomes clear, as explained to jesper by the sarcastic, mischievous ferryman mogens (norm macdonald) and bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger alva (rashida jones), that the town's perpetually warring families, the ellingboes and the krums, and who comprise nearly all of the population, hardly exchange words, let alone letters. few months go by, without any letters at all.\nthe 2 families are in a constant state of war with each other and even the children are caught up in the frenzy and contribute to the animosity. alva resorted to selling fish as people didn't send their kids to school in town. now she is saving money to escape. the post office is a dilapidated structure, which is completely rotten and exposed to the elements, and jesper has a tough first night sleeping in the bitter cold with high winds. desperate to figure out a way to post letters from the town, jesper notices on the map in his office a far-off little establishment. there, he discovers a reclusive woodsman named klaus (j.k. simmons), with a house filled with handmade toys. terrified by the man's size and appearance, jesper flees, and leaves behind a drawing made by one of smeerensburg's children about his own home life. jesper prepares to escape the town when klaus comes to him, demanding to go to the house depicted in the drawing. there, klaus forces jesper to deliver a package to the boy inside-a toy. word of this event spreads to other children, who go to jesper the next day, thinking that, by sending letters to klaus, he will deliver a toy to them. jesper capitalizes on the idea and goes to klaus with the proposal of donating the toys in his house, to which klaus agrees provided the toys will be delivered at night so he can accompany jesper. news of the deeds quickly spreads, and more and more town children begin writing letters to klaus. the krum boy's toy leads him to play with an ellingboe girl, much to their clans' outrage. as more children write letters to klaus, jesper tells a boy who had earlier ridiculed him that klaus knows whenever any child misbehaves and only gives toys to good children. jesper says that klaus always knows when any child misbehaves, the acts of kindness they subsequently perform gradually inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their dispute. the children ask bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger alva to teach them to read and write so they can send letters. with her faith restored, alva uses her escape savings to reopen her school. eventually, jesper and klaus begin running out of toys to give to the children, and jesper suggests they make more in time for christmas. klaus initially refuses, but jasper happens upon a keepsake of klaus's late wife lydia, klaus forces him away.\nmotivated by márgu, a sami girl who can't write or speak in norwegian, jesper works with alva to help márgu write a letter asking for a sled, which he then attempts to build alone. seeing jesper's effort, klaus reconciles with him and the two finish the sled. while making the sled for the sami girl margu (neda margrethe labba) in a neighboring settlement, klaus tells jesper about his wife, lydia. he explains he made the toys to give to the future children that the couple never had, especially due to lydia's early passing. klaus realizes their work has been spreading joy to the children, and comes around to the christmas plan. márgu arrives with the rest of her people to help. as the town and jesper's relationship with alva flourish, jesper finds himself conflicted about whether to leave smeerensburg. meanwhile, family leaders mr. ellingboe (will sasso) and mrs. krum (joan cusack) form a temporary truce in order to stop jesper and klaus so that they can have the families resume their traditional feud. they eventually trick jesper's father into believing jesper had posted 14,000 letters. jesper's father arrives on christmas eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing the true reason he did everything he had since coming to smeerensburg to everyone. just before they leave town, jesper's father notices his son's remorse; after a private talk, he allows jesper to stay. when the 2 families heads go to destroy the christmas toys, jesper does everything he can to stop them and apparently fails, however, over the course of the resulting chase, mr. ellingboe's brutish daughter magdalone (sergio pablos) and mrs. krum's oafish son olaf (also pablos) fall in love, and thanks to alva having been informed by the children about their parents' plot, she and klaus had already replaced the toys in klaus' sleigh with wooden decoys. jesper's actions have redeemed him to klaus and alva, and they then deliver the christmas presents to the town. with jesper now redeemed, smeerensburg becomes a kind and happy town, with mr. ellingboe and mrs. krum being forced to end the families' feud due to the marriage of their children. jesper and klaus continue to deliver presents in smeerensburg and beyond for the next ten years. the year after that, klaus disappears, seemingly going to join his departed wife. jesper marries alva and they raise two children. he and klaus continue to deliver presents in smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. on the twelfth year, klaus mysteriously disappears. every subsequent christmas eve, jesper waits for klaus, who returns every year to deliver toys across the world."

      "postal worker jesper is sent to a remote, feuding town where he meets reclusive toymaker klaus. together, they inspire acts of generosity, kindness, and community, gradually transforming the town's culture. the film blends humor, heart, and inventive animation to explore friendship, redemption, and the origin of the santa claus myth. themes of empathy, hope, and the transformative power of goodwill underscore the story, making it a family-oriented tale of moral awakening."

      "in the pride lands of tanzania, a pride of lions' rule over the kingdom from pride rock. a lion rules over the other animals as king. all the animals of the pride lands are summoned to pride rock, the home of the pride of lions.\nking mufasa (james earl jones) and queen sarabi's (madge sinclair) newborn son, simba (matthew broderick), is presented to the gathering animals by rafiki (robert guillaume) the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor. the animals cheer and then bow to the new future king. mufasa's younger brother, scar (jeremy irons), covets the throne. he is envious of his brother's position as king and is disgruntled at the fact that he will never be king now that mufasa has an heir. simba rises early one morning and pesters his father to get up and show him the lands he's destined to rule over. mufasa illustrates from the top of pride rock that everything the light touches is their kingdom, except for a place on the horizon that is covered in shadow. mufasa tells simba he's forbidden from ever going there.\nmufasa explains to simba the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life\", which connects all living things. scar asks if mufasa showed him the shadow place on their morning walk. when simba replies no, scar adds that it is a dangerous place where only the bravest lions venture. simba perks up, saying he's brave, and begs his uncle to tell him what's there. scar feigns an accidental slip of the tongue by revealing that it's an elephant graveyard but praises simba's cleverness. he asks that simba never explore the place, but as simba reassures him and leaves, scar smiles to himself knowing full well that simba's curiosity will get the better of him. simba meets up with his friend nala. he tells her about a cool place he has found, lying to sarabi that it's around the water hole. sarabi gives them permission to go as long as zazu accompanies them. along the way, simba and nala devise a plan together to get rid of zazu, which works.\nthere, simba and his best friend, nala (moira kelly), are chased by three spotted hyenas named shenzi (whoopi goldberg), banzai (cheech marin), and ed (jim cummings). mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the horn-bill zazu (rowan atkinson), and rescues the cubs. though disappointed with simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and nala, mufasa forgives him. he explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over simba. scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill mufasa and simba in exchange for hunting rights in the pride lands. scar sets a trap for simba and mufasa. he lures simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. scar alerts mufasa, who saves simba and tries to escape the gorge. simba manages to grab hold of a broken tree, elevating himself above the wildebeests' horns while mufasa climbs down and runs alongside the animals. he manages to grab simba in his mouth and carries him to safety but is pulled back by the charging animals. after a tense moment, simba watches his father leap onto the side of the gorge, digging his claws into the dirt and struggling up the hillside. as mufasa nears the top, he sees scar standing over him. mufasa begs for scar's help, but scar betrays mufasa by throwing him into the stampede to his death. scar then deceives simba into believing that mufasa's death was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. he then orders the hyenas to kill simba. the three hyenas chase simba to the edge of an incline where he tumbles into a sea of brambles. small enough to avoid the sharp spikes, simba runs through them as the hyenas barely manage to stop near the base.\nunaware of simba's survival, scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both mufasa and simba, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the pride lands. the lionesses look on in fear as a horde of hyenas arrives to live alongside scar at pride rock. rafiki watches sullenly from a distance and smears the image he had once created of simba. simba collapses in a desert but is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and a warthog named timon (nathan lane) a wisecracking and self-absorbed yet loyal bipedal meerkat and pumbaa (ernie sabella) a naive warthog who suffers from uncontrollable flatulence. timon is initially afraid of the young lion but pumbaa asserts that he's still little and will grow up to be on their side instead of eating them. pumbaa picks simba up and carries him into the shade where he's revived.\nsimba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in swahili). they then invite simba to stay with them as a fellow outcast in their jungle paradise and teach him to eat bugs rather than meat. years later, the pride lands have been reduced to a wasteland under scars rule. zazu is confined to a bone cage singing while scar lazily lies about chewing on bones. zazu mutters under his breath that he never had to do this under mufasa. scar reels on the name, citing that the law is to never mention mufasa's name. shenzi, banzai, and ed appear, complaining that food and water have become scarce and that the lionesses refuse to hunt. an adult simba wanders around with timon and pumbaa and remembers his father. he sighs and collapses onto a bunch of wildflowers, spreading their petals and leaves to the wind. the wind carries them back to the pride lands where rafiki, sitting atop his tree, grabs them. he takes them back into the tree where he sniffs them and contemplates the apparent familiar smell. suddenly it strikes him; simba must be alive. crazed with happiness, he quickly smears a mane around the head of his simba drawing, stating that it is time. simba rescues timon and pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be nala. simba introduces her to pumbaa and timon, who is less than happy about the reunion since nala had tried to eat pumbaa. nala tells simba that everyone in the pride lands thought he was dead after scar told them about the stampede. simba and nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the pride lands have become drought-stricken under scar's reign. still feeling guilty over mufasa's death, simba refuses and leaves angrily. she tells simba that returning to the throne is his responsibility, but he storms off and walks out of the jungle to an open field. he tries to justify his decision before yelling at the night sky that mufasa wasn't there for him and feeling solemn that it was his fault. simba encounters rafiki, who tells simba that mufasa's spirit lives on in him. simba is visited by the spirit of mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. after rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, simba decides to return to the pride lands. timon and pumbaa are sleeping together as nala approaches them and nudges them awake, frightening them at first. she asks if they've seen simba, but rafiki appears overhead and declares that the king has returned. confused by this statement and rafiki's mysterious arrival and departure, timon and pumbaa listen as nala tries to explain that simba has decided to go back to the pride lands to take his place as king. crossing the desert, simba finally arrives in the pride lands to find it dark and barren. he eyes pride rock with a look of vengeance when nala, timon, and pumbaa appear beside him. they all agree to help simba reclaim the throne, though timon is less than impressed by the landscape they're fighting for. simba offers timon and pumbaa as live bait and they do put on a colorful performance for the hungry hyenas while he and nala move closer. simba instructs nala to rally the lionesses while he looks for scar. simba confronts scar, who shames simba over his supposed role in mufasa's death. sadly, simba confesses that he was, though it was an accident. scar uses this and accuses simba of being a murderer, backing him up to the end of pride rock to the point where simba slips over the edge, dangling by his paws. lightning strikes and ignites a fire beneath him as scar looks over him, remarking that this was just the way mufasa looked before he died. then scar grabs simba's paws and whispers in his ear that he was the one to kill mufasa. enraged, simba leaps over the edge and pins scar, choking him to confess the truth to the lionesses. a battle ensues between simba and his allies and the hyenas. when timon is cornered by shenzi and banzai in the lion's den with zazu, pumbaa comes to the rescue, his fury provoked when banzai accidentally calls him a pig. scar attempts to escape but is cornered by simba at a ledge near the top of pride rock, with the grounds around ablaze with fire.\nscar begs for mercy and attempts to deceive simba by blaming his actions on the hyenas. simba spares scar's life but orders him to leave the pride lands forever. scar refuses and attacks simba. following a brief battle, simba throws scar off the ledge. scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death. with scar and the hyenas gone, simba takes his place as king, and nala becomes his queen. with the pride lands restored, rafiki presents simba and nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life."

On Arrakis he trains with the Fremen, learns their ways, and adopts the names Usul and Muad’Dib; he embraces the prophecy of the Lisan al-Ghaib, falls in love with Chani, and ascends as a leader while the Baron Harkonnen, Rabban, and Feyd-Rautha vie for control. After a violent coup, Paul undergoes the Water of Life ritual, awakening prescience and a path to power. He foresees a galaxy-spanning holy war and must decide between personal love and a universe-altering fate. Paul drives the Fremen to strike the Harkonnens and the Emperor, defeats Feyd-Rautha in single combat, and coerces the Emperor to surrender by threatening to destroy spice production. The fremen seize Arrakis’ capital, the spice fields, and orbit, while Chani departs as Paul’s vision of a grim future tightens around him. Paul’s rise culminates in a contested throne and the dawn of a potentially devastating empire, framed by his awareness of the cost of power and the role of Arrakis in the fate of the known universe.",

      "following the defeat of house atreides by house harkonnen in the year 10,091, princess irulan (florence pugh), daughter of the padishah emperor, shaddam iv (christopher walken), journals about her father's betrayal of the atreides. house harkonnen had attacked overnight without warning, provocation or declaration of war. all atreides were seemingly killed. baron harkonnen had done the dirty work on behalf of the emperor. on the planet arrakis, a fremen tribe led by stilgar (javier bardem) accompanies paul atreides (timothée chalamet) the exiled duke of house atreides and his pregnant mother lady jessica (rebecca ferguson) to their hidden home, sietch tabr. some fremen suspect they are spies, while stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \"outer world\" will bring prosperity to arrakis. a squad of harkonnen soldiers hunt for the fremen and are killed, as the fremen are masters of hiding and fighting in the desert, which harkonnen advanced technology cannot match. the fremen extract the water from the dead harkonnen bodies as there is no other source of natural water out in the desert. the dead bodies are left in the desert and consumed by the worms summoned by fremen. arrakeen is the capital of north arrakis, where the harkonnen have established a base and have secured the spice fields. baron vladimir harkonnen and his nephew rabban want the fremen to be exterminated to gain complete control. the fremen accept paul after stilgar says that he would have no hesitation to pledge his own life to him. the council wanted to give them back to desert, but fremen prevails in his arguments. meanwhile, paul knows that if he can convince the fremen to follow him, he can seriously disrupt the spice production. such action would enable him to face the emperor. stilgar commands jessica to succeed sietch tabr's dying reverend mother, ramallo, by drinking the water of life, a drug fatal for males and untrained women. stilgar shows jessica that the water drained from dead bodies and collected in a lake which amounts to 38 million decaliters. this water is considered sacred and not drank by the fremen. stilgar says that when the freemen have enough water, the messiah lisan al gaib (the voice of the outer world) will rise and change the face of arrakis. stilgar considers jessica the mother of lisan al gaib. the north fremen tribes do not believe in the legend of lisan al gaib and call it a southern fremen tradition. jessica uses her bene gesserit training to transmute the liquid and survive, inheriting the memories of past reverend mothers. the liquid prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, alia (anya taylor-joy), allowing jessica to communicate with her. ramallo and her handmaidens are horrified at the thought of an unborn child sharing the effects of the water of life but, after ramallo's death during the ritual, they are convinced of jessica's abilities and power of prescience as a miracle associated with the mother of the lisan al gaib. they agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern fremen of the prophecy, which chani (zendaya) and her friend shishakli (souheila yacoub) correctly deduce to be a myth fabricated by the bene gesserit to manipulate the fremen. nonetheless, chani begins to respect paul after he declares that he only seeks to fight alongside the fremen, not rule them. paul declares that jessica's survival was not a miracle, and that bene gesserit are trained to transmutate poison, the reason that she survived.\njessica tells paul that the baby talks to her and tells her that to become the kwisatz haderach, paul must drink the water of life as well. paul is not interested, choosing to focus on avenging his father and house atreides. the kwisatz haderach is a male with access to both his male and female ancestral memories, enabling him to bridge space and time. paul and chani fall in love as paul immerses himself in fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a fedaykin fighter, riding a sand-worm, and raiding harkonnen spice-harvesting operations. with every victory, stilgar tells the fremen about paul's extraordinary fighting skills, that paul claims he learned from his previous masters.\nthe sand-worm that paul rides is one of the biggest ever seen, thus cementing his reputation as the lisan al gaib. paul adopts the fremen names usul (\"the strength of a pillar\") and muad'dib (\"kangaroo mouse\"). due to the continuing spice raids by the fremen, baron vladimir harkonnen (stellan skarsgard) head of house harkonnen and former steward of arrakis, enemy to the atreides, asks his nephew rabban to bring arrakis under total control and stop the fremen raids on their spice trade. vladimir is afraid that if the spice production fails, the emperor will take it out of their hands.\none of fremen's raids on a spice depot in arrakeen destroys 80% of their last crop, prompting rabban to go into the desert on the attack.\nbut the fremen are very well defended in the desert and take the harkonnen out one by one, forcing rabban o retreat. irulan tells the emperor to let the conflict on arrakin to descend into war and then the emperor can intervene as a savior and bring peace. irulan secretly wonders if paul atreides is still alive. the reverend mother in the royal palace, warns irulan that if paul is alive, he would the truth about the emperors liquidation of the atreides clan. if the other houses are made aware of it, the emperor would face war and would lose his throne. due to rabban's failures, vladimir installs his cunning and sadistic nephew feyd-rautha (austin butler) as arrakis' ruler.\nlady margot fenring (léa seydoux) of the bene gesserit is sent to evaluate feyd-rautha as a prospective kwisatz haderach and secure his genetic lineage. the reverend mother wanted to know if feyd-rautha can be controlled, even though irulan believes that he is a psychopath. fenring reports that feyd-rautha is driven, cruel but sexually vulnerable and hence can be controlled. fenring had sex with feyd-rautha and got pregnant, and hence his bloodline is now secure. fenring reveals that feyd-rautha murdered his own mother. jessica believes that the north already believes in paul as the lisan al gaib. she travels south to unite with fremen fundamentalists who believe most strongly in the prophecy. jessica believes that her unborn son can be the kwisatz haderach and should be born in the south.\npaul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south as a messiah. in the south, jessica observes that the water of life is created when a sand-worm is killed by drowning it in water and then extracting the blue liquid from its throat. jessica orders that when a man enters the temple that he be allowed to take the water of life, despite knowing that any male who consumes the liquid is destined to die. during a raid on a smuggler spice harvester, paul reunites with his old mentor and warrior gurney halleck (josh brolin) the former military leader of house atreides, who leads paul to house atreides' hidden atomic warhead stockpile.\ngurney believes that with the 200 fedaykin from the north and thousands more from the south, paul can rule the entire planet. but paul reiterates that he has visions in which if he goes south, billions of people die across the galaxy. feyd-rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern fremen, destroying sietch tabr, cruelly killing shishakli himself, and forcing paul and the survivors to journey south to attend the fremen war council. upon arrival, paul drinks the water of life and falls into a coma, angering chani, but jessica hypnotically compels her to save paul. chani gives paul a mix of her tears with the water of life, which awakens him. now possessing clairvoyance across space and time, paul sees a narrow path to victory among all possible futures and an adult alia on water-filled arrakis. he also learns that jessica is the baron's daughter, assigned as concubine to duke leto by the bene gesserit to unite house harkonnen and house atreides in furtherance of their plan to produce the kwisatz haderach.\npaul also learns that arrakis was earlier known as dune. paul meets with the southern fremen war council, behaving almost maniacally and galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest thoughts. he declares himself the lisan al gaib, a messianic figure, and challenges the emperor, who arrives on arrakis with irulan and the sardaukar military force. as the emperor chastises the harkonnens for their failures (the harkonnens did not know that the southern regions of arrakis were inhabited and the identity of the muad'dib), the fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sand-worms to overpower the sardaukar. paul kills the baron and captures the emperor. meanwhile, gurney leads an assault on arrakeen, intercepting and killing feyd-rautha's brother and subordinate beast rabban (dave bautista). paul challenges the emperor for the throne and, to chani's dismay, demands to marry irulan. having been summoned by the baron, the other great houses arrive in orbit, ready to invade the planet, but paul threatens to destroy the spice fields if they intervene. feyd-rautha volunteers as the emperor's champion and is killed by paul in their duel. irulan agrees to marry paul on condition that he spare her father. the emperor reluctantly surrenders, but the great houses reject paul's ascendancy, so paul orders the fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. as stilgar leads the fremen onto the captured sardaukar ships, jessica and alia reflect on the beginning of paul's holy war. chani refuses to bow to paul and departs alone on a sand-worm."

    "synopsis": "In 1957 Maine, a 9-year-old boy, Hogarth Hughes, befriends a 50-foot alien iron robot that crash-landed nearby. A paranoid U.S. government agent, Kent Mansley, pursues the giant for destruction, bringing military force to Rockwell. Hogarth hides the robot in a junkyard and barn, teaches it English via comics, and helps it learn about life, death, and restraint. The robot accidentally damages infrastructure, causing a train collision; Hogarth and Dean McCoppin, a Beatnik artist, shelter and defend the alien while Mansley intensifies efforts to prove an invasion. Hogarth orchestrates safe concealment, but Mansley infiltrates Hogarth’s home and locates the robot, triggering a military investigation led by General Rogard. The robot saves Hogarth, rescues townsfolk, and is forced to confront fear and prejudice as Mansley pushes for a nuclear strike. In a climactic confrontation, the giant intercepts a Nautilus missile headed for Rockwell, sacrificing himself to save the town. He proclaims himself Superman as he collides with the missile, destroying it and erasing the immediate threat, though presumed dead. Months later, the town mourns; Hogarth keeps a scrap of the giant as a reminder, and the robot’s parts begin reassembling on a glacier, signaling a possible return.",

      "in october 1957, during the cold war, an object (vin diesel) from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of maine and then enters the forest near the town of rockwell. a fishing boat collides with the object, which appears to be a giant robot made of iron. the boat sinks, but the skipper survives and swims to the coast, guided by the lighthouse. the skipper reaches rockwell and makes a call to the government about what he saw. hogarth meets an artist named dean in a diner, where hogarth's mother annie works as a waitress. the following night, nine-year-old hogarth hughes (eli marienthal) is watching a late-night movie on tv, as his mother is working late at the cafe. the tv suddenly has no picture, and hogarth climbs to the roof to find the antenna cut off, and a trail going into the forest. hogarth investigates a trail of destruction in the forest and finds the object, a 50-foot-tall alien robot. he runs away but then returns to save the robot when he gets electrocuted while trying to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. hogarth turns the substation power off, to stop the robot from being electrocuted.\nhogarth's mother returns from work and is worried at not finding him at home. she goes into the forest looking for him and finds him near the substation. hogarth tries to tell her about the robot, but his mother refuses to hear anything and takes him home. hogarth eventually returns and befriends the giant, finding him docile and curious. the robot follows hogarth back to his house, where he lives with his mother annie (jennifer aniston). upon their return, the giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. the giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head.\nhogarth and the robot flee before the train crew can investigate. hogarth discovers that the giant is self-repairing, as loose parts from the collision return under their own power and reassemble. hogarth hides the robot in their barn and helps to teach it about life. he is able to teach the robot how to speak english through his comic books. the robot is impressed with superman but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; hogarth tells the giant that he can be \"who you choose to be\". investigating the destroyed power station, us government agent kent mansley (christopher mcdonald) discovers evidence of the robot and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby rockwell. at the substation, while he is investigating, the robot eats mansley's car.\nfinding a bb gun hogarth left near the substation, mansley takes up a room for rent at hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. he is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the u.s. army to the possible presence of the robot. worried that they will be discovered, hogarth evades mansley and takes the robot to beatnik artist dean mccoppin (harry connick, jr.).\nhogarth enjoys his time with the giant but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the giant after he witnesses hunters killing a deer. hogarth is detained and interrogated by mansley when he discovers evidence of the giant after finding a photo of him next to hogarth and summons a u.s. army contingent led by general shannon rogard to the scrapyard to prove the giant's existence.\ndean is able to pass off the robot as one of his works of art when mansley and lieutenant general rogard (john mahoney) investigate. later, while playing with a toy gun, hogarth inadvertently activates the giant's defensive system, firing a laser beam in the process. dean yells at him for nearly killing hogarth, and the saddened giant runs away with hogarth giving chase. dean realizes that the giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to hogarth as they follow the giant. in rockwell, the giant rescues two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. mansley, having seen the robot, orders an attack to stop it. hogarth and the robot attempt to flee but hogarth is knocked unconscious. hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the giant assumes that hogarth is dead, and in a fit of rage and grief transforms into a war machine and returns to rockwell. mansley convinces rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the uss nautilus, as conventional weapons prove to be ineffective. hogarth awakens and returns in time to calm the giant while dean clarifies the situation to rogard. rogard is ready to stand down and order the nautilus to deactivate its primed nuke, but a panicked mansley snatches rogard's radio and orders the missile launch. the missile is targeted to hit rockwell, where it will destroy the town upon impact in the resulting nuclear detonation. mansley attempts to escape, but the giant intervenes, and rogard has mansley arrested. to save the town, the giant bids farewell to hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. as he soars into the missile's path, the giant remembers hogarth's words, \"you are who you choose to be,\" smiles contentedly, and declares himself \"superman\" as he collides with the weapon. the missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving rockwell, its population, and the military forces nearby, while the giant is presumably destroyed, leaving hogarth, dean, annie, and rogard devastated. months later, dean and annie, now a couple, have a chat at a memorial of the giant made by dean, standing in rockwell. hogarth is given a package from rogard containing a screw from the giant, which is the only remnant found. that night, hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. the screw joins many other parts as they converge on the giant's head on the langjökull glacier in iceland, and the giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself."

    "overview": "traveling across the multiverse, miles morales meets a new team of spider-people, made up of heroes from different dimensions. but when the heroes clash over how to deal with a new threat, miles finds himself at a crossroads.",
    "synopsis": "Miles Morales joins a multiverse-wide team of spider-people including Gwen Stacy to confront a powerful foe, the Spot, who can travel via interdimensional portals after the collider incident. Miles learns that canon events and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider Society govern each universe’s fate; Miles’ actions to save others trigger conflict with Miguel, leading to Miles’ arrest and eventual escape. The Spot blames Miles for his condition and seeks power by assimilating colliders across worlds; Gwen reconnects with Miles across dimensions, travels to earth-50101 with Pavitr Prabhakar and Hobie Brown, and teams up against the Spot as the collider network collapses. Miles, Gwen, and Hobie defect from the Spider Society; Miguel reveals Miles is the original anomaly, born from a universe where no Spider-Man existed, implying that Miles’ existence created chain reactions that could erase realities. Miles activates a go-home machine to return to his home dimension, but the device identifies earth-42 as Miles’ origin rather than his own, sending him there. In earth-42, Miles encounters a different life: his uncle Aaron is alive, his father is dead, and Miles becomes the Prowler after the spider-bite origin is severed from his universe. Gwen travels to earth-1610 to locate him while Miles’ friends and allies from various worlds—Peter B. Parker, Mayday, Pavitr, Spider-Punk, and others—assemble to reclaim him as the Spot intensifies multiversal attacks. The story culminates with Miles and allies navigating loyalties, family, and identity as they race to prevent the Spot from destroying the multiverse and attempt to bring Miles home.",

      "on earth-65, police captain george stacy (shea whigham) is unaware that his daughter gwen stacy (hailee steinfeld) is spider-woman, who the police believe to be a murderer (when she failed to save her boyfriend from an alien attack, and was seen leaving the crime scene by the police).\none night, gwen encounters a version of the vulture (jorma taccone) from an italian renaissance-themed alternate universe. vulture had no clue how he ended up into gwen's universe, and had no concept of the multiverse either.\nmiguel o'hara/ spider-man 2099 (oscar isaac) and jess drew/earth-332 (issa rae) arrive using portal-generating watches and help gwen neutralize the vulture.\ngeorge corners gwen, who then reveals her identity to him; distraught, he attempts to arrest her. miguel reluctantly grants gwen membership into the spider-society (an elite strike force dedicated to the security of the universe), allowing her to escape with him and jess. in brooklyn on earth-1610, sixteen months after the alchemax collider's explosion, miles morales (shameik moore) encounters the spot, an alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during the explosion. due to his condition, the spot can simply travel through space at will by opening portals wherever he wants.\nthe spot / johnathon ohnn (jason schwartzman) blames miles for causing his condition and reveals that, while testing the collider, he had transported a spider from another dimension, earth-42, which then bit miles and turned him into spider-man. this incident took a year ago and since then miles has been fighting crime as spider-man. as part of the gig, he encountered his uncle aaron davis, who was a criminal and died in a duel with miles.\nmiles has not revealed his truth to his parents jeff and rio (lauren vélez). he aims to learn quantum physics at princeton university where they are experimenting on moving electrons across dimensional barriers. this way, he believes, he can learn to travel to other dimensions.\nthe spot says that he created spider-man and then the spider-man blew up the collider and turned johnathon into the spot. spot blames spider-man for the loss of his job, his life, his face and his family. the spot then accidentally transports himself into a void, where he learns to travel to other universes containing alchemax colliders to empower himself further. gwen travels to earth-1610 and reconnects with miles while tracking the spot. gwen tells miles about the spider society, who is trying to keep the multiverse from collapsing. gwen says that miles is the only real friend that she made since peter died. gwen says that the society is very strict about where she goes and for how long, else she would have visited sooner. gwen contemplates that in every other universe gwen falls for spider-man and it does not end well.\nmiles wants to join the society, but gwen says that it is a small, elite group and currently has no openings.\ngwen goes to spot's home in this dimension and figures out that he has taken the collider of that world. each collider gives spot more power and now he has the ability to create inter-dimensional portals by himself and control them. gwen and jess track spot to earth-50101. jess blames gwen for taking her eyes off spot to go to meet miles, and gives her an hour to fix the issue. miles secretly follows gwen through a portal to earth-50101, and they team up with local spider-man pavitr prabhakar / spider-man india (karan soni), and later hobie brown / spider-punk (daniel kaluuya), against the spot, who absorbs the power of that world's collider. the spot and miles share a vision of the spot's future attacks that include the deaths of police inspector singh (the father of pavitr's girlfriend gayatri) and miles' father jeff (daniel kaluuya). the spot departs and the collider collapses; miles saves singh from the ensuing destruction, but earth-50101 begins to fall apart from its disrupted \"canon event\" before members of the society arrive to contain the damage.\nmiles, gwen, and hobie are sent to the society's headquarters on earth-928, where hundreds of spider-people reside in a massive complex. miguel is the native spider-man of earth-928 and the founder of the spider-society. miles, along with gwen and hobie, meets with miguel and reunites with peter b. parker (jake johnson), who is accompanied by his infant daughter mayday. miguel explains to miles that each of the spider-people's stories throughout the multiverse contain \"canon events\", such as the deaths of a police captain close to spider-man, and that straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. miguel reveals that he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe. miles realizes that the spot murdering jeff, who is set to be promoted to police captain in two days, is a canon event. miguel imprisons miles to prevent him from saving jeff, but hobie helps miles break loose before quitting the society.\nas miles flees through the complex, miguel orders the society to capture him. hobie refuses to participate and quits the society, leaving earth-928.\nmiguel corners miles and tells him that he is the original anomaly: miles was never supposed to be spider-man, as the spider that bit him came from earth-42, resulting in earth-42 having no spider-man, and that if the spider had not bitten miles, earth-1610's peter parker would have stopped the collider and survived, and the spot would never have existed. miles overpowers miguel and flees to what he believes is his home dimension. the society had a \"go-home\" machine that is used to send the anomalies back to their dimensions. miles activates the machine, to go back home. the machine identifies that target dimension by analyzing the dna of the anomaly.\nconsidering gwen a liability, a furious miguel ejects her from the society and forcibly sends her back to earth-65. once there, gwen reunites with george, who has resigned from his job as police captain. the two reconcile, and george gives gwen a portal watch left by hobie. miles arrives in what he thinks is his home world. when he arrives in his bedroom he shares everything that happened to his mother, rio. he even tells her that he is spider-man. she has no idea who or what spider-man is and continues with the laundry. confused, miles continues to try to explain before \"glitching\". miles realizes that he is on earth-42, the home of the spider that bit him, rather than his own dimension. the go-home machine recognized the spider's signature from earth-42 and sent miles there.\nin this world, his uncle aaron davis (mahershala ali) is alive while his father is dead; because spider-man does not exist, new york city is riddled with unchecked crime. aaron restrains miles and is soon joined by earth-42's miles, who has become the prowler instead of aaron. as the society searches for miles in earth-1610, gwen travels there and speaks with his parents, promising to find him and bring him home.\nthe spot begins his multiversal attack, miles prepares to escape, and gwen assembles a team to find miles, consisting of peter b., mayday, pavitr, hobie, margo kess, spider-man noir, peni parker, and spider-ham."

    "overview": "in 1961, an unknown 19-year-old bob dylan arrives in new york city with his guitar and forges relationships with musical icons on his meteoric rise, culminating in a groundbreaking performance that reverberates around the world.",
    "synopsis": "1961: Dylan moves to New York, meets Woody Guthrie’s circle; Seeger mentors him, books gigs, signs with Grossman. He records a debut mostly with covers; sales disappoint, fuels desire for original work. He befriends Sylvie Russo, enters a romance and a tense partnership; Joan Baez notices his socially aware lyrics. Russo challenges him to fight for creative control; Dylan’s fame grows, Bach-like clashes with traditional folk. Tensions spike during a disastrous tour with Baez; Dylan defies expectations, crafts a bold shift toward electric rock, while assembling a band and beginning Highway 61 Revisited. 1965 Newport Folk Festival looms; committee fears backlash; Seeger and the committee press him to stay acoustic. Dylan invites Russo, but she leaves after witnessing a Baez duet. Ignoring pleas, Dylan performs with an electric band, booed and objected to by the audience; Johnny Cash fuels bravado, Grossman and Seeger counter the disruption and salvage an acoustic encore per Cash’s insistence. The controversial set secures artistic independence but severs ties with the folk establishment and Seeger/Baez. Dylan visits Guthrie one last time, then rides off on a motorcycle toward an uncertain future.",

      "in 1961, bob dylan moves to new york city, determined to meet his ailing idol, woody guthrie, who has been hospitalized. during his visit, dylan encounters guthrie's close friend, pete seeger. dylan performs a heartfelt song he wrote for guthrie, impressing both guthrie and seeger. seeger offers dylan a place to stay, gradually introducing him to the city's vibrant folk scene. at a concert, dylan meets sylvie russo, captivating her with his sharp wit, contrarian views, and tales of working at a carnival. the two quickly become romantically involved and move in together. dylan's talent soon catches seeger's attention, and he introduces him at an open mic night attended by industry professionals, including manager albert grossman. dylan charms the audience and impresses grossman, who immediately offers to represent him. dylan begins recording his debut album but is pressured by the label to include mostly covers. the album's poor sales frustrate him, leaving him yearning to showcase his original work. before leaving on an extended work trip to europe, russo confronts dylan about his distant demeanor and his refusal to share details about his past. despite their argument, she encourages him to fight for creative control. while russo is away, dylan seizes the growing political and social unrest as inspiration for his music, crafting songs that resonate deeply with audiences. his socially-conscious lyrics catch the attention of joan baez, leading to a professional and romantic relationship. as dylan's fame grows, so do the strains on his relationship with russo. financial success brings additional stress, and russo becomes increasingly suspicious of dylan and baez's connection. by 1965, dylan and russo part ways, their relationship unable to withstand the pressures of his rising stardom. dylan, now a cultural icon, begins to feel constrained by the expectations of both the music industry and the folk community. a disastrous tour with baez highlights these tensions. during an argument, baez criticizes dylan's ego and urges him to perform his popular hits instead of his newer material. the tension boils over during a concert, with dylan publicly lashing out. frustrated with his lack of creative freedom, dylan decides to explore a bold new direction, incorporating electric instruments and rock influences. this shift alarms the folk music community, which prizes acoustic simplicity. dylan assembles a band and begins recording highway 61 revisited. as the newport folk festival approaches, dylan, the headliner, plans to unveil his new sound. the festival committee, fearing backlash, tries to dissuade him. even seeger makes a heartfelt appeal, reminding dylan of the potential damage to his legacy and their shared values. meanwhile, dylan invites russo to the festival in an attempt to rekindle their relationship. she agrees but, after witnessing a duet between dylan and baez, realizes she cannot continue the relationship and leaves. ignoring the committee's pleas, dylan takes the stage with his electric band, encouraged by an intoxicated johnny cash. the performance provokes outrage from the audience, who boo and throw objects at the stage. chaos ensues as the committee, led by seeger, attempts to cut the sound, but grossman and toshi seeger thwart their efforts. at cash's insistence, dylan reluctantly performs an acoustic encore. dylan's controversial performance secures his artistic independence but alienates him from the folk community, including seeger and baez. in the aftermath, dylan visits guthrie one final time before leaving new york, setting off on his motorcycle to an uncertain future."

Toky o endures a brutal attack; Noriko survives but Grim tolls mount. A civilian-led resistance forms to stop the behemoth: veteran labor, naval engineers, and a plan to lure Godzilla to Sagami Bay, depressurize the sea with freon and scissors, and kill it via explosive decompression. Shikishima, now driven to redeem himself, trains with Tachibana to fly a modified demo plane loaded with bombs. The mission progresses: Godzilla breaches the trap, battles brutal forces, and is drawn into the flotilla. Shikishima crashes his plane into Godzilla’s mouth, destroys its head, and detonates, tearing the monster apart as the fleet hauls the carcass to the surface. He ejects, survives, and is reconciled with Noriko after a hospital reunion; Godzilla’s flesh fragment regenerates as it sinks, leaving the threat unresolved but the survivor to face the future.",

      "in 1945, near the end of world war ii, kamikaze pilot koichi shikishima (ryunosuke kamiki) lands his mitsubishi a6m zero for repairs at the japanese base on odo island. the mechanics cannot find anything wrong with the engine or the fuel-lines of the plane. the base itself is a small one and in the middle of nowhere and has a barely even landing surface, which means shikishima was desperate to land there.\nlead mechanic sosaku tachibana (munetaka aoki) deduces that shikishima is feigning technical issues to flee from his duty. as shikisima sits near the water, he sees deep sea fish on the surface.\nthat night, godzilla, a large dinosaur-like creature who is familiar to the locals, attacks the garrison. tachibana tells shikishima to fire at the monster from his plane. shikisima manages to get into his plane, whose guns are pointing straight at godzilla. but he panics, fails to shoot, and is knocked unconscious. godzilla attacks the base and its soldiers and creates havoc. the small guns with the soldiers are not near enough to stop the godzilla. godzilla even destroys shikisima's plane. when shikisima awakes the following day, he finds tachibana is the only other survivor, who is furious at him for failing to act. in december 1945, shikishima returns home to find his parents were killed in the bombing of tokyo. the city itself was engulfed in flames and is now in ruins. plagued by survivor's guilt, he begins supporting a woman, noriko oishi (minami hamabe), whose parents also died in the bombing, and an orphaned baby, akiko (sae nagatani), whom noriko rescued. akiko's mother asked noriko to take care of her.\nsumiko is shikisima's neighbor and tells him that it is too late to play the hero. when sumiko finds that an orphan girl is involved, she helps noriko and shikishima to take care of it. she gives her white rice to shikisima to make gruel for the baby. in march 1946, shikisima finds employment aboard a minesweeper tasked with disposing of naval mines from world war ii. the job offers a lot of money, as the job is risky with a real possibility of death at any moment. the american magnetic mines are the most feared. japan doesn't have specialized equipment to deal with the 60,000 mines and deploys 2 converted tugboats for the job. the wooden tugboats won't attract the magnetic mines. noda works with shikisima on the tugboats. the tugboats carry a cutter which cut the tethers of the mines to the ocean floor. when the mines float to the surface, they are exploded with a 13 mm gun. yoji (kuranosuke sasaki) is their captain. slowly, shikisima saves enough money to rebuild his home. noriko finds a job in the ginza.\nin july 1946, godzilla is mutated and empowered by the united states' nuclear tests at bikini atoll; it sinks the submarine uss redfish (which photographed the creature before being attacked and sunk. the parts of the submarine that came in contact with the creature had signs of radioactivity) and destroys several other ships (like the uss lancaster) in route to japan. owing to tensions with the soviet union, the u.s. offers no help save for a few decommissioned imperial japanese navy vessels approved by general douglas macarthur. the japanese government, concerned about inducing panic, does not notify the public about the danger. in may 1947, shikishima and his minesweeper crew travel to the ogasawara islands and are tasked with stalling godzilla's approach to japan. the crew watches as the much bigger godzilla takes out the 2nd tugboat with effortless ease. shikishima's tugboat attacks godzilla with their mines and guns but have little impact as godzilla pursues them in the ocean.\nthey release a mine into godzilla's mouth and detonate it, causing significant damage, but it quickly regenerates. before godzilla can destroy the tugboat, the heavy cruiser takao (sent from the docks in singapore) then engages godzilla but is destroyed when the monster unleashes its heat ray. after returning to tokyo, shikishima opens up to noriko about his encounters with godzilla.\ndespite the gag order, shikishima tells noriko about his history with godzilla.\ndays later, godzilla makes landfall in japan and attacks ginza, where noriko works. she narrowly survives the initial attack on the subway line and reunites with shikishima (who had come to rescue her). enraged by tank fire, godzilla obliterates much of the district with its heat ray, killing tens of thousands. noriko pushes shikishima to safety but is caught in the blast and presumed dead. devastated by the loss, shikishima vows revenge. 30,000 people were killed in the attack. 20,000 homes and buildings were destroyed. frustrated by the government's inaction, one of the minesweeper's crew, former naval engineer kenji noda (hidetaka yoshioka), devises a plan to destroy godzilla by luring it out to sagami bay (which is 1500 meters deep) before surrounding it with freon tanks and rupturing them, lowering the water's buoyancy and sinking it, letting the resultant water pressure crush it. should the plan fail, balloons will be inflated under godzilla to force it back up, killing it through explosive decompression. hotta (miou tanaka) is the head of the task-force working under noda. this is a citizen led effort, as the japanese armed forced do not exist, and the us will not support japan, due to its continued cold war with russia. to enact his plan, noda has recruited navy veterans to crew disarmed ijn destroyers (which were planned to be given away to the un). shikishima recruits tachibana to repair a broken-down kyushu j7w shinden fighter. the shinden is a prototype which was never deployed in the war but is the most maneuverable plane in japan. tachibana was required as the plane was rusting in a hangar and needed a crack mechanic to make it air-worthy. tachibana loads the plane with 2 bombs and a machine gun.\nhe plans to kill godzilla in a suicide attack by flying into its mouth and detonating explosive charges on board. he leaves akiko in the care of his neighbor sumiko (sakura ando) before godzilla resurfaces. noda gets reports of the godzilla's movements towards tokyo and calculates that godzilla will reach sagami bay by 11 am the following day. but godzilla is faster than anticipated and already crosses the shoreline.\nshikishima attacks with his plane and lures godzilla to the trap set by two destroyers. sumiko receives a telegram intended for shikishima. godzilla survives the initial plunge and then breaks free before being forced back up, sustaining serious injuries from the resultant decompression-induced barotrauma. with the help of a fleet of tugboats organized by mizushima, another crew-mate from the minesweeper, the ships haul godzilla to the surface.\nenraged, godzilla prepares to destroy all the vessels with its heat ray, but shikishima crashes the plane into godzilla's mouth and destroys its head, causing the energy of the heat ray to tear its body apart. the crew celebrates as shikishima ejects before the explosion and parachutes to safety, using an ejection seat that tachibana installed in the shinden, imploring him to let go of his guilt and continue living. upon returning home, sumiko gives shikishima the telegram, which leads him to a hospital where he reunites with noriko, who survived the destruction but has a black bruise creeping up her neck. meanwhile, a chunk of godzilla's flesh begins to regenerate as it sinks into the ocean."

    "overview": "after a shipwreck, an intelligent robot called roz is stranded on an uninhabited island. to survive the harsh environment, roz bonds with the island's animals and cares for an orphaned baby goose.",
    "synopsis": "Roz, a RoZZum unit 7134 robot, washes ashore on an uninhabited island after a storm and begins adapting to the wild. She disrupts the local fauna at first, then learns to communicate with animals. A goose nest is crushed during the ordeal, but an egg hatches into Brightbill, a gosling who imprints on Roz. Roz bonds with Brightbill and, with help from ally fox Fink and wise opossum Pinktail, builds shelter and protects the gosling from predators. Brightbill learns to swim; Roz teaches him to fly with leadership from Longneck and Thunderbolt, enabling migration. Universal Dynamics monitoring and a damaged long-range transponder complicate Roz’s mission as vontra, a retrieval unit, arrives to reclaim her. Roz repairs a fellow RoZZum, rummage, but chooses to stay to aid island animals. When winter arrives, a storm drives the animals to a greenhouse; a contamination alert triggers a reco robot assault. The island’s creatures unite; Longneck sacrifices himself, and the animals repel the invaders. Roz and Fink rally the island to survive a brutal snowstorm; Roz powers down from exhaustion. In spring, Brightbill is celebrated as a hero, but a retrieval mission prompts Roz to flee, with vontra in pursuit. A climactic battle ensues; Brightbill and the animals force back the reco units, Roz is captured and a forest fire erupts, but she reboots, destroys vontra, and escapes with Brightbill as the drop ship explodes. Roz decides to leave for safety, vowing to return. Months later, she works in a Universal Dynamics greenhouse while secretly keeping memories of the island; Brightbill tracks her down, and their reunion hints at a future together.",

      "in a world immersed in technological wonders, roz, an endearing helper robot, finds itself in a precarious situation after crash-landing on a remote, untamed island. programmed to assist anyone in need, roz embarks on an unexpected journey through the dense wilderness, only to stumble upon a mysterious egg. as the island's curious animals gaze at the metallic newcomer with bewilderment and mockery, roz realises that survival in this unfamiliar territory demands more than just its programmed skills. now filled with uncertainty, roz must evolve and learn the ways of the wild. of course, forging alliances could help. but time is not on its side; roz must reach its full potential before winter. with reality blurring the line between technology and life, what if the wild robot discovered what it means to be a human?",

Clarence Odbody, a guardian angel, is sent to earth to save him and earns his wings only if George lives. Clarence shows George a alternate reality where he had never been born; Bedford Falls becomes Potterville, a corrupt town of bars and sleaze, familiar helpers and institutions erased, and George’s loved ones fail or forget him. In this bleak world, George’s brother Harry dies, the bank collapses, and George’s wife Mary and friends either forget him or reject him. After witnessing the consequences, George pleads for another chance and prays for help. Clarence reveals the truth: George’s life mattered, and the wardens of heaven granted him a return to the real world. Back in Bedford Falls, the town’s people rally to save Bailey Building and Loan; Mr. Potter’s scheme is thwarted by public support. A grateful town gathers to help George, Harry arrives to honor him, and a Christmas miracle restores his purpose and status as a respected, beloved figure. The film closes with George’s restored family, community, and a symbolic angel’s wings moment underscoring the value of a life devoted to others.",

      "this movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. it opens with a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. they are receiving prayers from mortals, like \"please, god, something's the matter with daddy\". george bailey ( james stewart ) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to earth to stop him. they select clarence ( henry travers ), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. the senior angels promise that clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. the bulk of the movie is a replaying of george's life, by the senior angels and for clarence's benefit, so that clarence will understand george. george bailey was a young man, living in a small upstate new york town, but with big dreams. from an early age, he wanted to get away from bedford falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. the first incident that clarence sees is that, at age 12, george saved his younger brother harry's ( todd karns ) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. george lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. shortly after that, while working part-time in mr. gower's ( h.b. warner ) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. angry at the neglected delivery, gower, drunk in the sorrow at the recent death of his son, beats george until the boy explains the situation. upon testing the medicine and realizing the boy had averted a horrible mistake, gower is profoundly remorseful and grateful to george, who vows to keep the error to himself. the two little girls in george's life at that point are mary hatch ( donna reed ) and violet bick ( gloria grahame ), who seem to be competing for his notice. george's father ( samuel s. hinds ), with a small staff including uncle billy ( thomas mitchell ), run a small building and loan company that finances mortgages for the people of bedford falls. they face a difficult battle with the evil, avaricious, and wealthy henry potter ( lionel barrymore ). the wheelchair-bound mr. potter is on the board of directors of the building and loan, holds much of its assets, along with almost everything else in town, charges people exorbitant rent on his own apartments, and would like to put bailey's company out of business. george wants to begin his adventures after going to college. while he has enormous respect for his father and what he is doing to help people, he definitely does not want to follow in his father's footsteps at the building and loan. but one thing after another thwarts his plans. george went to work at the building and loan for a few years after graduating from high school, with the expectation that harry would take this over when he graduated, and george would go on a european tour and then go to college. but his father has a fatal stroke, and george has to take over the b&l for a few months, giving up the european tour. then potter attempts to liquidate the b&l, the only thing that can stop it is for george himself to take it over. so he gives up college, and gives his college money to harry. the plan at that point was that, after harry graduates, he will take over the b&l, and george will go to college. but harry returns from college having married ruth dakin, and ruth's father has offered him a job in upstate new york. although harry vows to turn it down for george's sake, george cannot bear to cost his brother the opportunity, so he has no choice but to stay with the b&l. george marries mary hatch after a difficult introduction--he mistakenly thinks mary is in love with his lifelong rival sam wainwright ( frank albertson ). they are about to go on their honeymoon with $2000 they have saved up. but a banking crisis occurs. potter has taken over the bank that guarantees the b&l's loans, and has called in the loans. the customers are in a panic and are tempted to go over to potter's bank. the only way george can save the situation is to provide for the customers' needs out of his honeymoon money. their friends ernie ( frank faylen ) the cabbie and bert ( ward bond ) the policeman arrange for them to have a cut-rate honeymoon at their house. they serenade the newlyweds from outside in the rain. the b&l continues to provide affordable housing for the people of bedford falls, creating a whole subdivision \"bailey park\". this includes the home of mr. martini ( william edmunds ), the local tavern keeper, and his family. sam wainwright and his wife come by to offer that george and mary take a vacation with them in florida, but they can't get away even for that. potter is disturbed that george's b&l is taking customers away from his own apartment business, and attempts to bribe george into working for him instead, offering a huge salary and extensive travel. tempting as that is, george is repelled by everything potter stands for, and declines. so george stays with his wife and four children in bedford falls, never getting to leave. world war ii comes and goes, and harry serves (george is exempt because of his ear) and heroically saves an entire transport ship by shooting down two attacking airplanes. he is awarded the congressional medal of honor at a ceremony in washington. on the morning before christmas, the day that bedford falls will have a huge celebration for harry, a bank examiner arrives to conduct a routine audit. the same day, uncle billy goes to the bank for a routine deposit of $8,000 in cash. potter happens by, and billy proudly points out the newspaper with the news about harry. he accidentally folds the newspaper with the cash envelope in it, and potter takes it back. billy then realizes that he has lost the money. potter, now in another room, sees this, and sneaks out. billy arrives at the b&l, where george, generous as always, is giving violet some of his own money for her to travel to new york city and start a new life. when billy tells george about the loss, there is an uproar. george and billy search everywhere that the money could possibly have been left. george shouts at billy that this means bankruptcy, scandal and prison, and that he, george, isn't the one who will go to prison. george goes home in an incredibly foul mood, where his family are preparing for a christmas party that evening. george is extremely bitter and nasty, and verbally abuses everyone, saying at one point \"why do we have to have all these kids?\" the whole family are alarmed at his behavior. he learns that their youngest daughter \"zuzu\" ( karolyn grimes ) is in bed with a cold. she apparently caught it walking home from school, having not buttoned her coat because she didn't want to harm a rose that she had been given. george goes up to see her. while handling the rose, some petals fall off. george puts them in his watch pocket. zuzu's teacher, mrs. welch, phones to ask about zuzu. george gives her a brutal tongue-lashing over her carelessness. when mr. welch gets on the line, george abuses and threatens him. then george starts kicking and throwing things. the children are in tears. george refuses to talk about what's wrong or what is bothering him and storms out of the house. mary phones uncle billy to find out what's wrong. the children ask whether they should pray for their father, and mary says yes. while word spreads of the calamity, george goes to see mr. potter to beg for a loan of $8,000. mr. potter is completely unsympathetic and sarcastic. he suggests that george has been cooking the books, playing the market with company money, or perhaps paying off a woman, pointing out that he is known to have been giving money to violet bick. potter asks about collateral. all george has is a $15,000 life insurance policy, but with only $500 equity. mr. potter says \"you're worth more dead than alive.\" george goes to mr. martini's tavern and starts drinking, and then praying for divine guidance. his friends, including the kind and gentle bartender nick ( sheldon leonard ), notice and try to help. mr. martini mentions george's name out loud, and mr. welch ( stanley andrews ), the husband of the teacher that george insulted for no reason over the telephone earlier, sitting nearby, hears it. he punches george, causing a bloody lip. george leaves, though his friends urge him to stay and rest. george drives his car toward a bridge. because of the snowy weather, he accidentally drives it into a tree. the homeowner comes out and upbraids him for harming the tree. george just keeps walking, out onto the bridge, to kill himself. just as george is about to jump into the frigid river and drown, clarence comes down to earth; his moment has come. he knows george well enough to know that if he, clarence, jumps into the river, george will rescue him. he does so, and george jumps in and rescues him as predicted. they go to the toll-taker's shack to dry their clothes. clarence explains all--that he is an angel, \"clarence odbody, angel second class\", sent to save george from committing suicide. to george's astonishment, clarence knows the whole story of his life. george is disbelieving and cynical about the whole thing, mentioning that it is not surprising that he got only a second-class angel, one without wings. he resists clarence's entreaties, believing that he must have consumed tainted liquor. he finally says \"i wish i'd never been born.\" clarence formulates his plan, and, after a little prayerful communication with the senior angels, says \"you've got your wish. you've never been born.\" things change immediately. in the alternate universe it isn't snowing. george notices that he can hear through his left ear, and his lip isn't bleeding. clarence points out that many things will be different now. as george and clarence walk back toward town, they pass the tree that george had hit with his car. the car is gone, and there is no gash in the tree. the homeowner stops by, and george asks about the car and the damage to the tree. the homeowner knows nothing about this. he says \"you had me worried. one of the oldest trees in pottersville.\" george is confused, and tries to correct the man, but the man angrily tells george that the town is called pottersville. george and clarence walk off. they continue into town. martini's tavern has become a sleazy dive, and mr. martini is nowhere to be found. it is now owned by the bartender nick, but who is now very nasty and insulting. george and clarence sit down at the bar. clarence's polite speech and demeanor immediately displease nick. george knows nick, but nick does not know george. when a cash register rings, clarence points out that, whenever that happens, it means an angel has earned his wings. an elderly mr. gower, now a homeless derelict, comes in, and nick tells him to leave. george speaks to mr. gower, but mr. gower doesn't recognize him. when george asks about the guy, nick says that mr. gower spent 20 years in prison for poisoning some child in a manslaughter charge, and that if this stranger knows mr. gower, he must be a convict also. nick has george and clarence thrown out of the tavern, and then derisively makes the cash register ring, saying that he is giving out angel wings. in front of the tavern, george is seriously disturbed by what is going on when he sees the sign for 'nick's' in place of martini's name. clarence explains once again that george doesn't exist from that wish he made that he was never born. george brings up the issue that if he was never born and is alive and interacting with people... then who is he? clarence replies that george is a person with no identity in this alternate reality. george checks his pockets for his wallet, other identification, or his life insurance policy. clarence points out that they do not exist. finally, george checks his watch pocket. clarence says \"they're not there either.\"\n\"what?\" george asks.\n\"zuzu's petals. you've been given a great gift, george. the chance to see what the world would be like without you.\" continuing to be in denial of what is going on, george continues to walk downtown without clarence. bedford falls has become pottersville, and it is a dreary, brutish, and perverse place, full of bars and sleazy nightclubs. the movie theater, the emporium department store, and the b&l, are long gone. police are everywhere, dealing with disorders. george sees the police arrest violet and take her away from a brothel which is the former b&l. he hails ernie's taxi cab and asks to be taken home. ernie has no idea who he is or where he lives. he gives ernie the address, and ernie tells him that that is an abandoned house, but he will take him there anyway. when george asks ernie about his life, ernie tells george that his wife left him three years ago, and that he now lives alone in a place called potter's field. he visually signals for bert the policeman to follow them. as george searches the house calling out for his family, clarence appears. bert attempts to arrest them, but clarence intervenes and then vanishes, allowing george to escape. george then goes to his mother's house, which has become a broken-down boarding house called \"ma bailey's boarding house\". she opens the front door, but she does not recognize him and tells him to leave. george mentions uncle billy, and she says that he has been in an insane asylum since the b&l went out of business many years ago. still in denial of what is happening, george then goes with clarence to martini's house in bailey park. there is no such place--it is a wasteland with a cemetery. clarence points out the grave of harry bailey. clarence says \"your brother harry bailey broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.\" \"that's a lie! harry bailey went to war. he got the congressional medal of honor. he saved the lives of every man on that transport.\" says george. \"every man on that transport died. harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save harry. you see, george, you really had a wonderful life. don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?\" george then asks to see mary. clarence says that she never married, and works at the library. george goes there. she doesn't recognize him. he tries to embrace her; she screams and runs into a nightclub. he runs after her, but is confronted by a crowd made of many he knows, but they of course have no recognition of this wild man they have never met before in this reality. finally aware of what is happening, george calls out for clarence as the police intervene. george slugs bert and runs away. bert shoots at him but misses, then pursues in his squad car. george runs to the bridge where he had been about to jump, and calls out \"help me clarence, please! please! i want to live again!\" he piteously calls to god bring him back. with that plea, the alternate universe suddenly ends. it's snowing once again. bert arrives in his police car, and calls out to george that he's been looking for him, since seeing his car plowed into the tree. he also points out that george's lip is bleeding. george is delighted to hear this, and to know that bert knows him. he checks his watch pocket; the rose petals are there! george is ecstatic. he runs into town, which is once again bedford falls, and has all its familiar institutions, which he greets with unbounded joy. he even wishes mr. potter a merry christmas, who sarcastically wishes him a happy new year in jail considering the authorities are waiting for him at home. george arrives home, knowing that he will likely be arrested for bank fraud. the officials are there, ready to arrest him. however, george stuns them by his delight at his arrest warrant, especially since his children are there also, and all have a joyful reunion. mary comes home, along with many people led by uncle billy. contrary to mr. potter's claim that they would hate him for losing their money, it turned out that when word got around that george was in financial trouble, the townspeople that he had been so generous to had contributed whatever they could provide. dozens of people arrive, with a whole laundry basket full of money, jewelry, and other valuables. a telegram arrives from sam wainwright in europe, saying that he had been contacted by mr. gower about the situation, and would advance up to $25,000 to cover the debt on the b&l. at this, the bank examiner, both moved by this show of public support and knowing that the financial deficit will be compensated, moves up to contribute and the attending police officer tears up the arrest warrant with a smile. suddenly, harry arrives from new york, having immediately left his award banquet upon hearing that his brother needed his support, and toasts \"to my big brother george. the richest man in town.\" in the last scene, as the whole crowd sings \"hark the herald angels sing\" and then \"auld lang syn\" george finds a copy of the 'the adventures of tom sawyer' with a brief handwritten note on the inner pages in his inside coat pocket. it reads, \"dear george. remember no man is a failure who has friends. thanks for the wings! love, clarence.\" when mary asks who clarence is, george, well aware she would never believe the whole story, just says it is a christmas present from a very dear friend. at that moment, a bell on the christmas tree rings. zuzu says \"look, daddy. teacher says, every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\" george says \"that's right. that's right.\" and, glancing heavenward, \"attaboy, clarence.\""

Carol Anne vanishes into the house’s walls through a closet, while parapsychologists from UC Irvine arrive: Dr. Lesh, Ryan, and Marty. Tangina Barrons explains the haunt is a poltergeist invasion tied to a family connection to the house; Carol Anne, five, is a bright life force anchored to the home, attracting both benevolent and malevolent spirits. A portal to another dimension lies in the children’s closet. Tangina and the team guide Steve and Diane through tests and a rope-extraction plan to retrieve Carol Anne. Diane volunteers to enter the light to rescue her daughter but is pulled into the portal; Tangina coaxs the lost spirits away while the mother and child re-emerge, though a malevolent Beast remains. The family endures a final assault: toys come alive, a clown doll pulls Robbie under the bed, coffins erupt from the ground, and the house floods with spectral energy as Teague’s cemetery-coverup scheme is revealed. The house implodes into the other dimension; the Freelings flee to a hotel, discarding the TV to deny further contact with the supernatural realm.",

      "in the suburban housing development of cuesta verde, california, the homes are modern and comfortable. steve freeling (craig t. nelson) is a successful real estate agent who works for a firm headed up by teague (james karen), a developer. steve lives in one of the cuesta verde homes with his wife, diane (jobeth williams), and their three children: teenage dana (dominique dunne) and preteen youngsters robbie (oliver robbins) and carol anne (heather o'rourke). strange events begin to occur when carol anne begins sleepwalking and carries on a seemingly one-sided conversation with a tv set that's turned on but has no signal. soon thereafter her pet bird dies, and the family conducts a small burial service. later that night, carol anne awakens again and talks to the television, while a spectral manifestation erupts from the television screen and enters the walls, causing an violent tremor that only the freelings feel. as the family wakes up, carol anne mysteriously announces, \"they're here.\" the next morning, drinking glasses inexplicably break at breakfast, and utensils bend by themselves. when diane asks carol anne who she meant when she said \"they're here,\" she answers, \"the tv people.\" at first the ghosts play harmless tricks and amuse the mother, including moving and stacking the kitchen table chairs. diane and carol anne discover an area in the kitchen where an unseen force will pull anything, including people, across the floor. when he arrives home from work, diane convinces steve the phenomenon is real by demonstrating it. he then announces that \"nobody's going' in the kitchen until i know what's happening.\" during a terrible thunderstorm, a gnarled tree outside the kids' bedroom window suddenly comes to life and grabs robbie (oliver robins), carol anne's brother, through a window. however, this is merely a distraction used by the ghosts to get carol anne's parents to leave her alone. using a force like a wind tunnel, they take carol anne through her bedroom closet into their dimension. steve rescues robbie, and the family believes that a tornado caused the trouble, until they realize that they can't find carol anne. they search the entire house including the pit for the new swimming pool until robbie hears carol anne calling for her mother eerily through the tv. a traumatized steve meets with a small group of parapsychologists from uc irvine, stating that \"we just want you to find our little girl.\" dr. lesh (beatrice straight), ryan (richard lawson), and marty (martin casella) are awestruck by the manifestations they witness. with the parapsychologists present, steve shows them things they've never before seen. he opens the door to the children's room to reveal toys and other objects flying around by themselves and disembodied laughing voices reverberating throughout the room. previously, ryan described a matchbox car taking seven hours to move seven feet, calling it \"fantastic. of course, this would never register on the naked eye.\" after they see the freelings' house, they are all humbled. over coffee (and a coffee urn that moves by itself), the parapsychologists explain to the freelings the difference between a poltergeist and a haunting. they determine that indeed, it is a poltergeist they are experiencing. the group witnesses several paranormal episodes where they hear carol anne talking to diane through the tv, see spirits, and hear the pounding footsteps of some terrible force, which subsequently injures marty. marty also suffers a terrifying hallucination where he seems to tear off his own face. the parapsychologists leave, with the exception of ryan, admitting they need more help. shaken and overwhelmed, dana leaves to stay with friends. the freelings also send robbie to his grandmother's house for his safety. later that day, steve has a conversation with his boss, teague, about a new housing project going up. they talk about how steve's company has built over cemeteries in the past, even where the freelings live now. whenever the company needed land to build or expand housing communities, they'd move the cemeteries, coffins, headstones and all. teague shows steve a new housing development the company is building not far from where the freelings live. as the two walk by a hillside cemetery, teague tells steve that he can have a new house right in that spot, with a large bay window overlooking the valley. steve remarks that the house can't simply be built over a cemetery. teague tells steve that the company has moved whole cemeteries before: the coffins were dug up and moved, along with their headstones, to new locations nearby. teague then reveals that much of cuesta verde was built on the location of one of these relocated cemeteries. steve seems quite astonished at the news, stating that \"that's sacrilegious.\" when the parapsychologists return, they bring a spiritual medium, tangina barrons (zelda rubinstein), a tiny woman who uses her psychic sensitivity to ascertain facts about the disturbances. tangina tells them that carol anne is \"alive and in this house.\" according to tangina, the spirits haunting the home have left this life but have not gone into the spectral \"light.\" they are stuck in between dimensions, watching their loved ones grow up, but feeling alone, causing them to feel lonely and even angry. carol anne was born in the house and has strongest connection to it. at only 5 years old, she gives off her own life force that is as bright as the light. it distracts and confuses the spirits, who think carol anne is their salvation. hence, they have taken her. however, tangina also warns everyone that a malevolent spirit also exists in the next dimension. it likes that the spirits are confused and lost, and uses carol anne as a distraction so they cannot move on into the light. tangina says \"it lies to her and tells her things only a child can understand. to her, it simply is another child. to us, it is the beast.\" they realize the entrance to the other dimension is through the children's bedroom closet. tangina tests the dimensional portal with a few tennis balls that drop through the living room ceiling below the kids' closet. by tying a rope around a live person who can enter, and presumably exit the other side, with enough time to grab carol anne, they could bring her back. tangina intends to be the one to go into the light, but diane insists, saying that carol anne will only come to her mother. with the rope around her waist, diane goes into the portal and tangina coaxes the agonized spirits away from carol anne to the real light. while tangina is in her trance-like state telling the lost spirits to cross over into the light, steve panics and pulls on the rope, meeting the beast face-to-face. diane falls through the living room ceiling clutching carol anne and bearing new streaks of grey hair, presumably from fright; both diane and carol anne are also covered in ectoplasm. after steve revives both of them in the downstairs bathtub, tangina pronounces that \"this house is clean.\" unfortunately, though the spirits have seemingly moved on, the beast hasn't, and wants revenge. on their final night in the house, steve leaves diane alone with the children so he can go and talk to teague, who presumably is trying to get steve to reconsider leaving. while robbie and carol anne are getting ready for bed, robbie's clown doll comes to life and pulls him under the bed. diane, relaxing in the master bedroom, hears her son's screaming voice and tries to investigate, but is pulled against the wall and ceiling by an unseen force. robbie manages to rip the clown doll to pieces but a strange, mouth-like portal appears in carol anne's closet and attempts to suck the children in. diane tries to get to her son and daughter but runs into the beast itself, in the form of a snarling, skeletal demon. it blocks carol anne's and robbie's door and lunges at her, causing her to fall down the stairs. diane runs to the backyard to seek help from her next-door neighbors, but slips into the freshly-dug swimming pool. a rainstorm has filled it with rain and mud, and as diane tries to escape, coffins begin erupting from the earth, releasing skeletal corpses into the pool. her neighbors hear the commotion and arrive to help diane out of the pool, but they refuse to enter the house with its windows now blazing with ghostly energy. diane runs back into the house alone to get robbie and carol anne. she finds carol anne and robbie barely able to fight the energy that tries to suck them into the portal; they dangle from their bed frames, hanging on only by their hands, while their feet sway toward the closet door. diane manages to pull them to safety and they run from the house. coffins and bodies begin exploding out of the ground throughout the house. steve pulls up in his car with teague as a passenger, and they both see the dead bodies erupting from the ground. steve recalls the earlier conversation he had with teague, where teague revealed that cuesta verde was built over the site of a relocated cemetery. it is now obvious that teague never really relocated the cemetery, he simply built the housing development over top of the graves after moving only the headstones. realizing this truth, steve rebukes him in anger. dana arrives in her boyfriend's car and is hysterical over what is happening to the house. the freelings get into steve's station wagon and they drive off. the beast grows so angry that the house implodes through the portal into the other dimension as stunned neighbors (including teague) look on. the weary family checks into a hotel for the night. not wishing to tempt fate, steve pushes the television set outside their room."

    "synopsis": "Emmet Brickowski, an ordinary construction worker in a Lego universe, discovers the piece of resistance and is captured with a glowing back-brace by Lord Business’s bad cop. Prophecy and Vitruvius’ warning about the special drive Emmet toward master builders, who are hunted for creativity. Emmet journeys with Wyldstyle, Vitruvius, Batman, and other masters across worlds, from cloud cuckoo land to the old west, to thwart the Kragle weapon that freezes reality. They train, fail, and regroup after Master Builders are captured; Emmet’s visions reveal his own potential. Vitruvius dies, revealing the prophecy was false; the true power is belief in oneself. Emmet sacrifices to disarm the Kragle, freeing the worlds and inspiring Wyldstyle to unite Lego people against Business. In the real world, Finn’s father condemns play, but reconciles after realizing creativity matters; the Lego world stabilizes, Business reforms, and Emmet and Wyldstyle (Lucy) enter a relationship. Duplo aliens later threaten the realm, prompting ongoing play and imagination.",

      "in a lego universe, the blind and elderly wizard-like master builder vitruvius (morgan freeman) attempts to protect a super-weapon called the \"kragle\" from the evil lord business (will ferrell). he fails, but prophesies that a person called \"the special\" will find the piece of resistance capable of stopping the kragle. lord business believes vitruvius simply made up the prophecy and kicks him off of a cliff.\nlord business is an evil businessman who hates master builders, tyrant of bricksburg and the lego universe who is the company president of the octan corporation under the name president business. eight and a half years later, lord business is now president business, ruler of the whole world & who wants everyone to follow instructions in their daily life. an ordinary construction worker named emmet brickowski (chris pratt) comes across a woman named wyldstyle (elizabeth banks) searching for something in the construction site. when he investigates, he falls into a hole and finds the piece of resistance (revealed to be a krazy glue cap). compelled to touch it, emmet experiences vivid visions and passes out. he awakens in the custody of bad cop (liam neeson), lord business' lieutenant, with the piece of resistance attached to his back. there, emmet learns of business' plans to freeze the world with the kragle (revealed to be a tube of krazy glue with the label partially rubbed out) at \"taco tuesday\".\ngood cop/bad cop is a police officer with a two-sided head and a split personality who serves lord business as the commander of the super-secret police wyldstyle rescues emmet and takes him to the old west, another lego \"world\". she explains that every \"world\" used to be connected with people from different \"worlds\" helping each other in everyday activities. however, lord business abhors the thought, and constructs walls to separate all the \"worlds\". in the \"old west\", wyldstyle introduces emmet to meet vitruvius. she explains that she and the wizard are master builders, gifted people capable of building anything they need without instruction manuals. she further explains that due to business' disapproval of such anarchic creativity, master builders are actively hunted down by business, led by bad cop. lord business explains to bad cop that due to his dislike of people messing with his stuff (using lego blocks to create new things without instruction manuals, he is going to use kragle (short for a faded tube of krazy glue) to \"freeze\" everyone so that they can't change things at random. although disappointed to find that emmet displays no trait possessed by master builders, wyldstyle and vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a humanoid deity called \"the man upstairs\", the person who is said to be the creator of all the \"worlds\". bad cop tracks down emmet, wyldstyle, and vitruvius and a chase ensues. they are rescued by wyldstyle's boyfriend batman (will arnett) and travel to the cloud cuckoo land. there they are taken to a council of the remaining master builders. emmet says that he's not a master builder and \"the least qualified person in the world to lead\". master builders are unimpressed with emmet and refuse to fight business. master builders include superman (channing tatum), green lantern (jonah hill), wonder woman (cobie smulders), protocol droid c-3po, smugglers han solo and lando calrissian, gandalf, dumbledore, the flash, aquaman, milhouse, michelangelo and speed racer. due to a hidden tracking device in emmet's leg, bad cop and his forces attack, overwhelm, and capture all the remaining master builders. emmet, wyldstyle, vitruvius, batman, unikitty (alison brie) a unicorn/cat hybrid-like master builder who lives in cloud cuckoo land, and benny (charlie day) a \"1980-something space guy\"-like master builder who is obsessed with building spaceships, manage to escape on a submarine. it sinks soon after and they are rescued by metal beard (nick offerman) a pirate-like master builder seeking revenge on lord business for taking his body parts following an earlier encounter and causing him to remake his body from bricks. on board metal beard's ship, emmet believes the master builders' weakness is that their individual creativity prevents them from working together and that business will never expect them to 'follow the instructions'. after saving them all with his double-decker couch invention, emmet devises a plan to infiltrate business's headquarters and disarm the kragle. emmet fails with he and his team imprisoned and vitruvius decapitated by lord business. with his dying words, vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. business throws the piece of resistance off the edge of the universe, sets his headquarters to self-destruct, and leaves the master builders and bad cop to die. vitruvius' ghost appears before emmet and explains it was not the prophecy, but his self-belief that made him the special. tied to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, emmet flings himself off the edge of the universe to disarm the device and saving the master builders who escape further danger with the aid of good cop. inspired by emmet's sacrifice, wyldstyle, who reveals her real name to be lucy, rallies the lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight business' forces, with the master builders leading the charge. emmet finds himself in the basement of the real world, where the events of the story are being played out within the imagination of a boy, finn (jadon sand), on his father's lego set. the father-revealed as \"the man upstairs\" and finn's inspiration for business, who chastises his son for ruining the set by creating hodgepodges of different characters and play-sets and proceeds to permanently glue his perceived perfect creations together. realizing the danger his friends are in, emmet wills himself to move and gains finn's attention. finn returns emmet and the piece of resistance to the lego world and emmet, now possessing the skills of a master builder, fights his way onto lord business' ship. in the real world, finn's father looks at his son's creations again and is impressed. realizing finn based the villainous lord business on him, the father has a change of heart and allows his son to play with his lego however he sees fit. in the lego world, emmet tells business that he too, is special, as is everyone. finn's father reconciles with his son, which plays out as business reforming, capping the kragle with the piece of resistance, and removing the glue from his victims with mineral spirits. after the world is restored, lucy and emmet enter a relationship with batman's blessing. finn's father grants finn and his younger sister permission to play with the lego sets as well, causing duplo aliens to arrive in the lego universe and threaten destruction."

    "overview": "farmers from a village exploited by bandits hire a veteran samurai for protection, and he gathers six other samurai to join him.",
    "synopsis": "In 16th-century Japan, a drought-weary village plagued by bandits hires a weary ronin, Kambei, who agrees to recruit six more masterless samurai. Kambei, Katsushiro, and five others arrive, including a clownish swordsman Kikuchiyo, train the villagers to defend their fields, and set fortifications, moats, and a rotating guard. The samurai lessons and village sacrifices unfold as distrust gives way to teamwork; villagers share rice and lodging in exchange for protection. After pre-dawn raids and a failed first defense, the samurai implement a closing wall tactic to lure attackers and kill lone raiders. Two scouting bands are eliminated; Bandit muskets complicate defense. Missteps—Kikuchiyo’s fetch-for-respect, a romantic plot between Katsushiro and Shino, and a fatal wound to Heihachi—test resolve. The bandits mount a final assault with numbers; Kambei orders a bold gambit: admit all remaining 13 attackers, enabling a decisive counterattack. The ambush breaks the siege, but the heroics cost Nakoryu? (Kikuchiyo) and Gorobei and Yohei die; Kyz is killed by a backshot; Katsushiro grieves; Kambei and Shichiro survive with the farmers planting the next season’s barley. The film closes on a somber note: the farmers win the village’s safety, yet the samurai acknowledge they have lost more than they gained, underscoring the cost of war and the kinship between warrior and farmer.",

      "a gang of marauding bandits approaches a mountain village. the bandit chief recognizes they have ransacked this village before, and decides it is best that they spare it until the barley is harvested in several months. one of the villagers happens to overhear the discussion. when he returns home with the ominous news, the despairing villagers are divided about whether to surrender their harvest or fight back against the bandits. in turmoil, they go to the village elder, who declares that they should fight, by hiring samurai to help defend the village. some of the villagers are troubled by this suggestion, knowing that samurai are expensive to enlist and known to lust after young farm women, but realize they have no choice. recognizing that the impoverished villagers have nothing to offer any prospective samurai except food, the village elder tells them to \"find hungry samurai.\" the men go into the city, but initially are unsuccessful, being turned away by every samurai they ask sometimes rudely because they cannot offer pay other than three meals a day. just as all seems lost, they happen to witness an aging samurai, kambei, execute a cunning and dramatic rescue of a young boy taken hostage by a thief. as kambei walks towards town a young samurai, katsushiro, asks to become his acolyte. kambei insists that he walk with him as a friend. then the farmers ask kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. kambei, with katsushir's assistance, then recruits four more masterless samurai (rnin) from the city, one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits. although kambei had initially decided that seven samurai would be necessary, he plans to leave for the village with only the four that he has chosen because time is running short. the villagers beg him to take katsushiro also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees. a clownish ersatz samurai named kikuchiyo, whom kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance, ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away. when the samurai arrive at the village, the villagers cower in their homes in fear, hoping to protect their daughters and themselves from these supposedly dangerous warriors. the samurai are insulted not to be greeted warmly, considering that they have offered to defend the village for almost no reward, and seek an explanation from the village elder. suddenly, an alarm is raised; the villagers, fearing that the bandits have returned, rush from their hiding places begging to be defended by the newly-arrived samurai. it turns out that kikuchiyo, until this point merely a tag-along, has raised a false alarm. he rebukes the panicked villagers for running to the samurai for aid after first failing to welcome them to the village. it is here that kikuchiyo demonstrates that there exists a certain intelligence behind his boorish demeanour. the six samurai symbolically accept him as belonging with them, truly completing the group of wanderers as the \"seven samurai.\" as they prepare for the siege, the villagers and their hired warriors slowly come to trust each other. however, when the samurai discover that the villagers have murdered and robbed fleeing samurai in the past, they are shocked and angry, and kyz, the most professional and calm of the samurai, even comments that he would like to kill everyone in the village. the always clownish kikuchiyo passionately castigates the other samurai for ignoring the hardships that the farmers face in order to survive and make a living despite the intimidation and harassment from the warrior class, in the process revealing his origins to kambei, who suddenly perceives that kikuchiyo is himself a farmer's son. \"but who made them like this?\" he asks. \"you did!\" the anger the samurai had felt turns to shame, and when the village elder, alerted by the clamor that this revelation instigates, asks if anything is the matter, kambei humbly responds that there is not. the samurai continue their preparations without any animosity, and soon afterward show compassion toward the farmers when they share their rice with an old woman who, her family having been killed by bandits, cries out that she merely wants to die. the preparations for the defense of the village continue apace, including the construction of fortifications and the training of the farmers for battle. katsushir, the youngest samurai, begins a love affair with shino, the daughter of one of the villagers. shino had been forced to masquerade as a boy by her father who hoped the deception would protect her from the supposedly lustful samurai warriors. as the time for the raid approaches, two bandit scouts are killed, and one is captured and reveals the location of the bandit camp. three of the samurai, along with a guide from the village, decide to carry out a pre-emptive strike. many bandits are killed, but one of the samurai, heihachi, suffers a fatal sword wound when his villager friend lost emotion control upon seeing his imprisoned wife commit suicide. when the bandits arrive in force soon after this raid, they are confounded by the fortifications put in place by the samurai, and several are killed attempting to scale the barricades or cross moats. however, the bandits have a superior number of trained fighters, and possess three muskets, and are thus able to hold their own. kyz decides to conduct a raid on his own to retrieve one of the muskets and returns with one several hours later. kikuchiyo, jealous of the praise and respect kyz earns, particularly from katsushir, later abandons his post to retrieve another musket, leaving his contingent of farmers in charge. although he succeeds, the bandits attack the post, overwhelming and killing many of the farmers. kambei is forced to provide reinforcements from the main post to drive the bandits out, leaving it undermanned when the bandit leader charges this position. although they are driven off, gorobei is shot and killed and it is revealed that yohei, kikuchiyo's friend, was killed at his post. apart from defense, the initial strategy of the samurai is to allow the bandits to enter a gap in the fortifications one at a time through the use of a closing \"wall\" of spears, and to then kill the lone enemy. this is repeated several times with success, although more than one bandit manages to enter the village several times. on the second night, kambei decides that the villagers will soon become too exhausted to fight and instructs them to prepare for a final, decisive battle. during the night, katsushir's affair is revealed, and after an initial uproar, his amorous adventures provide comic relief to the embattled militia. when morning breaks and the bandits make their attack, kambei orders his forces to allow all 13 remaining bandits in at once. in the ensuing confrontation, most of the bandits are easily killed, but the leader takes refuge in a hut unseen. in what is portrayed as dishonorable act, he shoots kyz in the back from the safety of the hut, killing him. a despondent katsushir seeks to avenge his hero, but an enraged kikuchiyo bravely (and blindly) charges ahead of him, only to be shot in the belly himself. although mortally wounded, kikuchiyo ensures he kills the bandit chief, finally proving his worth as a samurai, before dying. dazed and exhausted, kambei and shichirji sadly observe \"we've survived once again,\" while katsushir wails over his fallen comrades. the battle is ultimately won for the villagers. the three surviving samurai, kambei, katsushir, and shichirji, are left to observe the villagers happily planting the next rice crop. the samurai reflect on the relationship between the warrior and farming classes: though they have won the battle for the farmers, they have lost their friends with little to show for it. \"again we are defeated,\" kambei muses. \"the farmers have won. not us.\" this melancholic observation sheds new light on kambei's statement at the beginning of the film that he had \"never won a battle.\" this contrasts with the singing and joy of the villagers, whose figuratively life-sustaining work has prevailed over war and left all warriors as the defeated party."

    "synopsis": "Anna Brady, a Boston real estate stager, plans to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy in Dublin on February 29, invoking an Irish leap-year custom. A storm diverts her flight to Wales; she hires a boat to Cork, then travels on foot across Ireland to reach Dublin before leap day. In Dingle she encounters Declan O’Callaghan, a surly innkeeper who agrees to drive her for euros to cover his debts. Their road trip is sabotaged by cows, thieves who steal Anna’s luggage, public brawls, and a string of misadventures. They hide their growing tension by traveling under the alias “O’Brady-Callaghan,” stay at a B&B, and experience a shared near-kiss after a castle visit and a wedding hymn. A hailstorm forces shelter in a church; at a wedding they bond, but Anna remains in pursuit of her plan. In Dublin, Declan reveals he once lost a fiancée and returns to his life; Jeremy unexpectedly proposes to Anna in the hotel lobby, prompting a visible decision. Anna calls off the engagement after discovering Jeremy’s self-serving priorities, and learns Declan’s mother’s claddagh ring was reclaimed. Returning to Dingle, Anna confesses she broke off with Jeremy and recognizes what she truly wants. Declan, who had been courting her with new feelings, finally proposes on a cliffside; she accepts, and they drive away together, leaving their future open to fate.",

      "successful real estate agent anna brady is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend jeremy sloane still has not proposed to her after four years. she decides to travel from boston to dublin, to propose to him on february 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. anna wishes to invoke an irish tradition that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal. during the flight, a storm diverts the plane to wales, where anna hires a boat to take her to cork. the severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called dingle, where she makes her way to a local tavern. anna tries to enlist the help of declan o'callaghan, the surly irish innkeeper. she requests him to taxi her across the country to dublin. at first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for eur500. the two set out in his old beat-up car. along the way, he makes fun of her fancy louis vuitton luggage, which he calls \"louie\". he also mocks her belief in a leap year \"tradition\" of women proposing to men. their travel is interrupted by a herd of cows blocking the road. anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her expensive shoes while leaning on declan's car which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. continuing on foot, anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. ignoring declan's warning, anna accepts the ride and hands them her luggage. before she can enter the van, they drive off without her. anna and declan eventually make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three van thieves going through anna's luggage. declan fights them, displaying unexpected strength for a man of his size, and retrieves anna's bag. anna and declan are ejected from the pub by the owner for fighting on the premises. anna and declan reach a railway station and decide to wait for the next train. while waiting, they hike up a hill to the ruins of a nearby castle. they ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. in doing so, declan also tells anna of an old irish legend about a young woman engaged to an elderly lord that she did not love. so the woman gave her wedding guests a sleeping potion so she could run away with a young celtic warrior she did love. during the story, they lose track of time and miss the train. that night, anna and declan are forced to stay at a local bed & breakfast in tipperary, where they pretend to be married, taking the name \"o'brady-callaghan\" so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. during dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, anna and declan are \"forced\" to kiss as well. this stirs feelings that neither had expected. that night, they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other. the next day while hitch-hiking down the road, anna and declan are caught in a hail-storm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. they are invited to the reception. but during the reception, anna drinks too much. anna begins to question her own intentions with jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for declan. just as the two are about to kiss, anna vomits and passes out. the following day they arrive in dublin, as they make their way on foot from the bus terminal to the hotel, declan reveals that he was once engaged but his fiancee ran off to dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. anna suggests to declan, now that he is in dublin, that he should ask for his mother's ring back. when they arrive at the hotel where jeremy is staying, jeremy surprises anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. anna turns around to look at declan just to see that he had already walked out of the hotel, and she accepts jeremy's proposal. at their engagement party in boston, anna learns that jeremy decided to propose because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple had wanted to move into at the beginning of the film. dismayed, anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she had discussed with declan earlier. when the alarm sounds, jeremy's instinct is to retrieve all of their electronic materials such as mobile phones, laptops, etc and shows no concern for anna's well-being. at that moment, anna fully realizes that there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including jeremy. meanwhile, back in dublin, declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiancee. sometime later, anna arrives back at caragh's tavern in dingle, where declan is running his seemingly successful business, having pulled together the balance he owed to his property owner with the help of the community. anna reveals to him that she has broken off her engagement to jeremy and tells declan that she has come to believe that all she needs/wants is right in dingle. when she proposes that they get together, ignoring her controlling nature and saying they should not make plans, declan leaves the room. thinking that she had been rejected, anna rushes outside and makes her way to the edge of a nearby cliff overlooking the sea. declan emerges, revealing that he went out simply to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring so that he could give it to her. taking her offer even further, declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. anna happily accepts, and they are later seen in declan's car, leaving their destination open to fate."

      "busy as she is as a boston stager, anna brady likes to control all aspects of her life. one of the few things she has not been able to control is getting married; her boyfriend, cardiologist dr. jeremy sloane, has not yet proposed to her after four years of dating. she hates the story told often to her by her father jack brady that there is an irish tradition that allows women to propose to their loved one on february 29, which is what purportedly got her paternal grandparents together. anna hates surprise herself, but she decides to surprise jeremy by showing up in dublin, where he is attending a conference, and proposing to him on leap day. but her trek from boston to dublin is anything but smooth. she gets stranded in dingle, her unintended entry into ireland, a few days before leap day. despite their antagonistic meeting, struggling pub/innkeeper declan o'callaghan agrees to drive anna to dublin... for a price; the agreed-upon fare would cover much of his debt, which would allow him to keep the pub/inn. largely because of their antagonism, anna, declan and their third, louis (what declan calls her louis vuitton suitcase), get into one misadventure after another, which threatens anna's arrival to dublin by february 29. through their time together, anna and declan might find that there are more important things in life than having that fairytale february 29 proposal and saving the pub/inn through extortion of anna.",

Ki-woo, aided by a college friend, is recruited to tutor Da-hye Parks, a wealthy teen, after fabricating his credentials; Ki-jeong forges papers to extend the scam, while the Kim family infiltrates the Park household by replacing staff with forged identities. Ki-woo mentors Da-hye and falls for her, and the Kim children install themselves as the Park staff, sending the original workers away and exploiting the Park mansion’s routines. Mrs. Park’s gullibility and Mr. Park’s status anxiety drive the scheme, aided by Moon-kwang, the housekeeper, who uncovers the ruse but is eliminated by Choong-sook. A sudden riotous night unfolds when the Parks leave on a trip; Moon-kwang’s husband Geun-sae, hidden in the basement, is revealed, and confrontation erupts: a skirmish ends with Geun-sae dead, Ki-jeong wounded, and Ki-taek killing Mr. Park in a panic. The Kim family escapes to their flooded apartment as chaos disrupts the Parks’ home. In the aftermath, Ki-woo narrates the fallouts: Ki-jeong dies, Ki-taek hides in the bunker, and Ki-woo and Choong-sook receive probation. The film closes with Ki-woo resolving to earn enough to buy the house and reunite with his father, gazing at the flickering Morse code signal from the hidden bunker beneath the Park residence.",

      "kim ki-taek (song kang-ho), an unemployed driver, lives with his wife choong-sook (jang hye-jin), son ki-woo (choi woo-shik) and daughter ki-jeong (park so-dam) in a shabby semi-basement apartment. the family struggles to survive, working low-paying gigs such as folding pizza boxes. ki-woo's friend min-hyuk (park seo-joon) visits the family and gifts them a large rock supposed to bring them wealth, before he leaves to study abroad. he suggests ki-woo take over his job as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's youngest daughter, da-hye (jung ji-so). min-hyuk has feelings for da-hye and figures that she will be safe with ki-woo, till he graduates college. in the lavish park mansion, ki-woo is interviewed by mrs. park (cho yeo-jeong) to tutor da-hye and is hired after mrs. park sees his talents (his degrees which were faked by his sister ki-jeong who is a master at forgery) in action.\nlearning of mrs. park's struggle to find an art teacher for her younger child, da-song, ki-woo suggests a \"professional\" named jessica, who in reality is ki-jeong. once hired, ki-jeong gets mr. park's (lee sun-kyun) driver fired (the driver hits on ki-jeong and she accuses him of sexual harassment by placing her panties in the back seat of the mercedes he is in charge of) and replaced with her \"uncle kim\": ki-taek. the kims soon get housekeeper moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) fired (moon-kwang had a rule that the family could not eat peaches, but ki-jeong discovers that its because moon-kwang herself is severely allergic to it and the manipulate the park family to believe that moon-kwang had tuberculosis. this enrages mrs. park, who fires her), with choong-sook hired in her place, employing the entire kim family.\nki-woo ends up kissing da-hye and both are attracted to each other. the parks go on an overnight camping trip, leaving the mansion in choong-sook's care. the kims take the opportunity to have a drunken party in the mansion, during which ki-woo confesses to his family that he is in love with da-hye. in the middle of their celebration, moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) rings the bell and claims that she came to retrieve something in the basement. the other kims hide, then choong-sook lets moon-kwang in. heading to the basement, the former housekeeper opens a secret bunker, revealing that her husband, geun-sae (park myung-hoon), has been hiding for 4 years to avoid loan sharks. as choong-sook threatens to call the police, the rest of the kims, eavesdropping, accidentally stumble into view. moon-kwang quickly records footage of the new \"staff\" addressing each other as father and children, then threatens to send the clip to the parks. the parks call choong-sook to announce that the heavy rain has ruined their camping trip, and they will be home soon. the kims scramble to confine moon-kwang and geun-sae, then clean up and hide, while choong-sook prepares some food requested by mrs. park. moon-kwang breaks free and runs up into the kitchen, but choong-sook pushes her down the basement stairs, severely wounding her head. while eating, mrs. park tells choong-sook that her son was traumatized one birthday by what he thought was a ghost coming up from the basement (he just saw moon-kwang's husband coming into the kitchen from the basement stairs). moon-kwang's husband is tied up by ki-taek and he reveals to him that he has been trying to communicate with mr park via morse code for several years (a light in the dining room has a switch in the basement) (but mr park, never understood morse code and hence never understood the message). after a few close calls, the other three kims leave the mansion undetected. they run back to their apartment, which has been flooded by the storm. they salvage what they can, ki-woo carrying the large \"lucky rock\" min-hyuk gifted his family earlier. the three, along with other displaced citizens, sleep in a gymnasium. meanwhile, moon-kwang dies from her concussion as geun-sae cries. but before dying she cuts off the tape that ki-taek had used to tie her husband up, thus freeing him. the following day, mrs. park throws a birthday party for da-song (jung hyun-joon) and ask the kims to come over and help with all the chores (the kims are bummed as they feel that the parks are totally oblivious to the lives of ordinary people. ki-taek is especially miffed when mrs and mr park, both make insensitive comments about air quality improving from all the rain from the previous night). during the party, ki-woo carries the rock down to the bunker, intending to kill geun-sae. geun-sae ambushes ki-woo, cracks his head open with the rock, then crashes the party, where he stabs ki-jeong in the chest.\ngeun-sae's sudden appearance triggers da-song's traumatic memory, causing the child to have a seizure. ki-taek rushes to stop ki-jeong's bleeding, while mr. park yells at him for the car keys, so park can drive da-song to the hospital. the key lands under the fighting choong-sook and geun-sae, before choong-sook kills geun-sae with a meat skewer. mr. park retrieves the key, while recoiling from geun-sae's \"poor man's smell.\" ki-taek, witnessing mr. park's reaction to the smell, also his own, snaps, fatally stabs him, then flees. the ending is narrated by ki-woo, recounting that ki-jeong died from her wounds, while he required brain surgery and suffered a weeks-long coma; he and choong-sook went to trial and were sentenced to probation. later, watching the parks' mansion, ki-woo notices a light flickering in morse code - a message from ki-taek, who managed to retreat into the bunker in the chaos, and has been hiding from and living off of the new owners. ki-woo promises that one day, he will earn enough money to buy the house and free his father. fantasizing about the day of their reunion, ki-woo ends his letter sitting in the shabby semi-basement apartment where the movie began."

    "debug_plot_summaries": [
      "the kims - mother and father chung-sook and ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son ki-woo and daughter ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of seoul. ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. despite not having that university education, ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to park da-hye, who min plans to date once he returns to seoul and she herself is in university. the parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect namgoong. while mr. and mrs. park are all about status, mrs. park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which min tells ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. in getting the job, ki-woo further learns that mrs. park is looking for an art therapist for the parks' adolescent son, da-song, ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \"jessica\", really ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four kims. in ki-woo also falling for da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the kims as a collective start a plan for all the kims, like ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. the most difficult to get rid of may be moon-gwang, the parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the parks themselves. the question then becomes how far the kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the parks.",
      "jobless, penniless, and utterly hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch ki-taek and his equally unambitious family struggle to make ends meet by working for peanuts in their dingy, basement-level apartment. however, their luck changes when their college-age son, ki-woo, seizes a golden opportunity: entirely unqualified, he has the nerve to pose as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's teenage daughter. and now, the sky is the limit. but as they adopt a winner-take-all strategy and launch a silent class war, the question arises. when it comes to parasites, how does one get rid of them?",
      "after his rich friend asks him to fake qualifications and take his tutor role to a rich teenage girl so none will try to date her in his absence, the poor lead takes up the offer & enters the rich yet gullible family. he then cons his way into the family, dates his friend's crush & schemes to get all his family get a job under the family. when the owners leave the house on vacation they move in & undergo a bizarre encounter which changes the lives of everyone.",
      "the kim family, living in poverty, infiltrates the wealthy park household by securing jobs under false pretenses. initially enjoying comfort and manipulation, tensions rise as hidden secrets, class disparities, and greed surface, culminating in violence. the film examines social inequality, ambition, and moral ambiguity, blending dark comedy, suspense, and tragedy. its narrative explores human desire, deception, and the consequences of systemic inequity, ultimately presenting a critique of modern society and the disparity between wealth and poverty."

    "synopsis": "An aging crime patriarch transfers influence over the Corleone empire to his reluctant son Michael, who initially seeks a life apart from the family business. After a confrontation with rival drug interests and a retaliatory hit on Don Vito, Michael is drawn deeper into orchestrating violence to protect the family. Vito refuses narcotics involvement, sparking a mob war among New York families. Sonny’s impulsive leadership collapses; Michael matures into a ruthless strategist, killing Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey in a Bronx restaurant, triggering a full-scale war. Michael’s spouse Kay and the family are drawn into the orbit of violence as betrayals and killings multiply. In Sicily, Michael marries Apollonia, but the war advances; Sonny dies, Apollonia is killed by a car bombing, and Vito’s later death leaves Michael to consolidate power. He negotiates truces, reorganizes operations across Las Vegas and the five families, and assumes the Don’s title as his father dies, with Fredo revealed as weak and sidelined. The climactic baptism scene intercuts a godfather ceremony with executions of rival bosses, solidifying Michael’s grip on the crime dynasty and sealing the transformation of the family business under his rule.",

      "in 1945, while his daughter connie is getting married to carlo rizzi, vito corleone, the don of the corleone family in new york city, listens to requests. the reception is where vito's youngest son, michael, a marine and world war ii hero who has so far avoided involvement in the family business, presents his girlfriend, kay adams. vito's godson, well-known singer johnny fontane, asks vito for assistance in landing a film role. to convince jack woltz, the studio president, to give johnny the role, vito dispatches his consigliere tom hagen. woltz initially rejects hagen's request, but after discovering the severed head of his beloved stud horse in his bed, he eventually gives in. drug lord virgil \"the turk\" sollozzo appeals to vito to invest in his drug business and provide police protection as christmas draws near. vito refuses, saying that he would lose his political network if he got involved in drug use. vito sends his enforcer luca brasi on an espionage mission to the tattaglias because he suspects sollozzo of having a relationship with the tattaglia crime family. at the first meeting, brasi is killed by garroting. officers later shoot vito and force hagen to attend a meeting. now that vito's firstborn son sonny is in charge, sollozzo puts pressure on hagen to convince sonny to agree to the drug deal. after nypd officers on sollozzo's payroll remove vito's guards, michael visits him in the hospital after he survives the shooting and discovers that he is unprotected. when michael stops his father's murder attempt, dishonest police captain mark mccluskey beats him. sonny hits bruno tattaglia in retaliation for the attempted hit at the hospital. in order to resolve the conflict, sollozzo and mccluskey ask to meet with michael. after pretending to be interested and agreeing to meet, michael plans to kill sonny and corleone capo clemenza and then disappears. at a restaurant in the bronx, michael meets sollozzo and mccluskey. he takes out a gun that clemenza had hidden in the restroom and kills both men. the five families engage in open warfare in spite of the government's crackdown on the murder of a police captain. moe greene provides sanctuary for vito's second son fredo in las vegas, while michael seeks safety in sicily. michael meets and weds apollonia, a local, in sicily. carlo is publicly attacked and threatened by sonny for mistreating connie physically. sonny rushes to their house after he mistreats her once more, but gangsters ambush and kill him at a highway toll booth. michael is the target of a car bomb that kills apollonia shortly after. vito arranges a meeting with the five families because he is weary of war and devastated by sonny's passing. he promises them he will stop opposing their drug trade and that he will not seek revenge for sonny's death. with his safety assured, michael goes back to his hometown to marry kay and start the family business. at the beginning of the 1950s, kay gives birth to two children. michael takes over as the head of the corleone family since his father is dying and fredo is not fit to be the leader. michael is informed by vito that don barzini ordered the hit on sonny and that barzini would attempt to kill him during a meeting that a traitor corleone capo had set up. since hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere,\" michael assigns him to oversee operations in las vegas with vito's help. michael is devastated to discover that fredo is more devoted to greene than to his own family when he goes to las vegas to purchase greene's share in the family's casinos. while playing with michael's son anthony in 1955, vito suffers a heart attack and passes away. tessio betrays michael by asking him to meet with barzini at vito's funeral. the meeting is scheduled for the same day as connie's baby's baptism. the dons of the five families are killed by corleone hit men, along with greene for failing to sell his hotel and tessio for betraying michael, while michael stands at the baptismal font as the child's godfather. michael coerces carlo into confessing to his role in sonny's killing. he tells carlo that he is not being killed but rather banished. carlo confesses, but shortly after, clemenza chokes him in a car. with kay present, connie questions michael about his role in carlo's demise. kay is relieved when michael denies responsibility when she asks him if he ordered carlo's death. capos enter the office and honor michael as \"don corleone\" as she departs."

After a sequence of killings, escapes, and moral choices, Jules contemplates retirement after surviving a chaotic night; Butch confronts Wallace again, rescues Wallace from an assault, and departs Los Angeles with his girlfriend. The film cycles back to the diner framing, tying disparate incidents into a single, circular web of crime, fate, and ambiguous ethics, all told out of chronological order through interconnected episodes, dark humor, and sudden violence.",

      "narrative structure\npulp fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: vincent vega, a hit-man; butch coolidge, a prizefighter; and jules winnfield, vincent's business partner.\nthe film begins with a diner hold-up staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story-line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. there are seven narrative sequences; the three primary story-lines are preceded by intertitles: 1. \"prologue - the diner\"\n2. \"prelude to \"vincent vega and marsellus wallace's wife\"\n3. \"vincent vega and marsellus wallace's wife\"\n4. prelude to \"the gold watch\" (a - flashback, b - present)\n5. \"the gold watch\"\n6. \"the bonnie situation\"\n7. \"epilogue - the diner\"\nif the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. hitmen jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) and vincent vega (john travolta) arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster marsellus wallace (ving rhames), from a business partner, brett. after vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, jules shoots one of brett's associates. he declaims a passage from the bible, and he and vincent kill brett for trying to double-cross marsellus. they take the briefcase to marsellus and wait while he bribes boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis) (an aging boxer) to take a dive in his upcoming match. the next day, vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, lance (eric stoltz) (who is married to jody (rosanna arquette)). he shoots up and drives to meet marsellus's wife mia (uma thurman), having agreed to escort her while marsellus is out of town. mia has just done a pilot for a show based on female secret agents called fox force five. they eat at jack rabbit slim's, a 1950s-themed restaurant, and participate in a twist contest, then return home. vincent asks mia if it's true that marcellus threw tony ricky horror out of a 4 storied window, for giving mia a foot massage. mia says tony never gave her a foot massage.\nwhile vincent is in the bathroom, mia finds his heroin and snorts it, mistaking it for cocaine. she suffers an overdose; vincent rushes her to lance's house, where they revive her with an injection of adrenaline into her heart. vincent drops mia off at her home, and the two agree never to tell marsellus about the incident. butch remembers how captain koons (christopher walken) a usaf veteran of the vietnam war who delivers a young butch his father's coveted gold watch. this watch was purchased by butch's great grandfather and was one of the first pocket watches ever produced. this watch has survived 2 world wars and made its way home, even when their owners didn't survive the wars. butch's father hid the watch for 5 years in his ass, while he was a pow in a viet cong camp.\nbutch bets the bribe money on himself and double-crosses marsellus, winning the bout but accidentally killing his opponent as well. knowing that marsellus will send hit-men after him, he prepares to flee with his girlfriend fabienne (maria de medeiros) but discovers she has forgotten to pack a gold watch passed down to him through his family. returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a sub-machine gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. when vincent exits the bathroom, butch shoots him dead and departs. when marsellus spots butch stopped at a traffic light, butch rams his car into him, leaving both of them injured and dazed. once marsellus regains consciousness, he draws a gun and shoots at butch, chasing him into a pawnshop. as butch gains the upper hand and is about to shoot marsellus, maynard the shop owner captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. maynard and his accomplice zed take marsellus into another room and begin to sexually assault him, leaving the \"gimp\" - a silent figure in a bondage suit - to watch over butch. butch breaks loose and knocks the gimp unconscious. instead of fleeing, he decides to save marsellus, and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. he kills maynard and frees marsellus, who shoots zed in the crotch with maynard's shotgun. marsellus informs butch that they are even, and to tell no one about the sexual assault and to depart los angeles forever. butch picks up fabienne on zed's chopper, and they drive away. earlier, after vincent and jules have killed brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them, but every shot misses; after briefly checking themselves for wounds, jules and vincent shoot him dead. while driving away with brett's associate marvin, jules professes that their survival was a miracle, which vincent disputes. vincent accidentally shoots marvin in the face, killing him, and covering vincent, jules, and the car interior in blood in broad daylight. they hide the car at the home of jules's friend jimmie (quentin tarantino), who demands they deal with the problem before his wife bonnie comes home. marsellus sends a cleaner, winston wolfe (harvey keitel), who directs jules and vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard. at a diner, jules tells vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their \"miraculous\" survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. while vincent is in the bathroom, a couple, ringo \"pumpkin\" (tim roth) and yolanda \"honey bunny\" (amanda plummer) hold up the restaurant (after ringo makes the case that restaurants are easy to rob as they are insured, just like banks) and demand marsellus's briefcase. distracting him with its contents, jules overpowers pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; honey bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun on him. vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but jules defuses the situation. he recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. jules and vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand."

      "faced with life's cruel irony, the unpredictable stories of a well-dressed pair of low-level hitmen; a gangster's statuesque moll, and a double-crossing prizefighter become inextricably intertwined, as the small-time crooks, honey bunny and pumpkin, summon up the courage to hold up their favourite l.a. diner. entrusted with retrieving a glow-emitting leather suitcase which belongs to their boss--the powerful crime kingpin, marsellus--instead, the dark-suited gunmen, vincent vega and jules winnfield, end up with a bloody mess. fortunately--with men like mr wolf always around to handle a crisis--there's time to cool off in a long twist contest, while at the same time, the proud champion boxer, butch, makes the decision of a lifetime. soon, things will come full circle, as, once more, jules and vincent find themselves in the perfect dead-end situation, exactly where it all began: an all-too-familiar cafeteria. is truth stranger than fiction?",
      "interwoven stories of crime, redemption, and moral ambiguity unfold in los angeles. hitmen vincent vega and jules winnfield navigate violence, loyalty, and philosophical reflection while intersecting with a boxer, gangster wife, and small-time criminals. the film blends crime, dark humor, and nonlinear storytelling, exploring fate, choice, morality, and human interconnectedness in a violent yet comical world.",

He tunnels through his cell wall, using a pick to dig for twenty years, then escapes through the prison sewage pipe to reach the Maine bank system, assumes the identity Randall Stephens, and withdraws nearly $370,000, exposing the warden’s money-laundering scheme. Upon escaping, he travels to a seaside town, leaving hints for Red. Red, serving a life sentence, seeks parole unsuccessfully until Andy’s disappearance prompts him to pursue a new life. After a long stretch, Red is eventually paroled, fulfills Andy’s directions, and journeys to Zihuatanejo, Mexico, where he and Andy reunite on a sunlit beach, ending in reunion and hope.",

      "in 1947, andy dufresne (tim robbins), a banker, is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, a golf professional. he is sent to the notoriously harsh shawshank prison to serve two consecutive life sentences, since the state of maine has no death penalty. andy keeps claiming his innocence, but his cold and calculating demeanor leads everyone to believe he did it. ellis redding (morgan freeman), also known as red, was a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence.\nred is being interviewed for parole after having spent 20 years at shawshank for murder. despite his best efforts and behavior, red's parole is rejected which doesn't phase him all that much. an alarm goes off alerting all prisoners of new arrivals. red and his friends bet on whichever \"new fish\" will have a nervous break down during his first night in prison. red places a huge bet on andy. during the first night, an overweight newly arrived inmate, nicknamed ''fat ass', breaks down and cries hysterically allowing heywood (william sadler) to win the bet.\nhowever, the celebration is short lived when the chief guard, byron hadley, savagely beats up the fat man for not keeping quiet when he is asked to. meanwhile, andy remains steadfast and composed. the next morning, the inmates learn that ''fat ass'' died in the infirmary because the prison doctor had already left for the night. andy inquires about the man's name only to get put down by heywood. though other prisoners consider andy \"a really cold fish,\" red sees something in andy, and likes him from the start. andy approaches red to smuggle a pick for him, an instrument he claims is necessary for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting. red believes that andy intends to use the pick for his escape. but then red sees how small the pick is. andy is beaten and sexually assaulted on a regular basis by other stronger inmates led by bogs diamond (mark rolston). during the first two years of his incarceration, andy spends most of his time working in the prison laundry or fighting off boggs. in 1949, when a work detail for tarring the roof of one of the prison's buildings is announced, red pulls some strings to get andy and a few of their mutual friends assigned to the job, giving everyone a break from the usual routine and a chance to \"enjoy\" the fine weather.\nandy overhears the captain of the guards, byron hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. andy informs hadley of how he can shelter his money from the irs by turning it into a one-time gift for his wife. he then offers to assist hadley in filling out the paperwork in exchange for some cold beers for his fellow inmates while on the tarring job. hadley first threatens to throw andy off the roof, but eventually agrees and do provide the working inmates with cold beers before the job is finished. red remarks that andy may have engineered the privilege to build favor with the prison guards as much as with his fellow inmates, but he also thinks andy did it simply to \"feel normal again.\" andy then helps jailer hadley (clancy brown) save taxes.\nwhile watching a movie, andy approaches red with another unusual demand and asks for a large poster of the actress rita hayworth. red is surprised by the demand but agrees to place the order. as he exits the theater, andy once more encounters his tormentors. although he is able to talk his way out of being sexually assaulted, he is brutally beaten within an inch of his life, putting him in the infirmary for a month. boggs spends a week in solitary for the beating. when he comes out, he finds hadley and his men waiting in his cell. they beat him so badly that he's left unable to walk or eat solid food for the rest of his life and is transferred to a prison hospital upstate. the sisters move on and never bother andy again. when andy gets out of the infirmary, he finds a bunch of rocks for him to sculpt and a giant poster of rita hayworth in his cell; presents from red and his friends. warden samuel norton (bob gunton) hears about how andy helped hadley and uses a surprise cell inspection to size andy up. he finds andy reading his copy of the holy bible and they talk about their favorite verses while the guards are turning the cell upside down looking for illegal possessions. satisfied with their encounter, the warden leaves and almost forget to give andy his bible back. he then encourages andy to keep reading the bible saying ''salvation lays within''. warden samuel norton assigns andy to the prison's decrepit library, ostensibly to assist elderly inmate brooks hatlen (james whitmore), but in reality, to leverage andy's financial expertise for managing the finances of the warden and other prison staff. andy also starts writing weekly letters to the state legislature, requesting funding to improve the library. his financial support practice is so appreciated that even guards from other prisons, when they visit for inter-prison baseball matches, seek andy's financial expertise. andy's client expands greatly and eventually includes warden norton himself. not long after, brooks suddenly snaps and threatens to kill heywood in order to avoid being paroled. andy is able to talk him down. brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but cannot adjust to the outside world. brooks goes to live in a halfway house. he is also given a job at a supermarket which he hates. finding it impossible to adjust to life outside the prison, he eventually commits suicide, leaving the message \"brooks was here\" carved on a wooden beam . after years of andy's ceaseless letters, andy receives $200 from the state for the library, along with a collection of old books and phonograph records. the legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of the marriage of figaro; andy plays an excerpt over the public address system, experiencing a moment of personal freedom before he is punished with solitary confinement. after his release from solitary, andy explains to a dismissive red that hope is what gets him through his sentence.\nthough the state senate thinks this will be enough to get andy to halt his letter-writing campaign, he is undaunted and redoubles his efforts. not long after, red has a new parole hearing and realizes he's been in prison for 30 years now. he uses the exact same words he used ten years earlier only with no enthusiasm at all. his parole is rejected again. andy gives him an harmonica to commemorate his 30 years which red replies by offering andy a giant poster of marilyn monroe to commemorate his 10 years. about four years after the mozart incident, the state senate finally comes to the conclusion that they won't get rid of andy with just another check. so they allow him a budget of $500 a year to expand the library, knocking down a few walls to unused rooms and renovating the space as he'd planned with his incessant letter campaign. andy uses the funds wisely and makes deals with book clubs and charities to create the best prison library in the state and names it after brooks. with the enlarged library and more materials, andy begins to mentor inmates who want to receive their high school diplomas so they can get decent jobs once they're out. warden norton profits on andy's knowledge of bookkeeping and devises a scheme whereby he put prison inmates to work in public projects which he won by outbidding other contractors (cheap labor from the prisoners). andy launders money for the warden, using a fake identity: \"randall stephens\". randall stephens officially has a birth certificate, social security number and driver's license. should anyone ever investigate about the scheme; they will chase a man who only exists on paper. andy shares the details with red, noting that he had to \"go to prison to learn how to be a crook.\" in 1965, tommy (gil bellows) comes to shawshank, a young inmate convicted of burglary. when tommy explains that he's been going in and out of prison ever since he was 13 years old, andy suggests that tommy should consider another line of work besides theft because he seems to be not so good at it. the suggestion really gets to tommy, who is also a father to a young child, and he asks andy to help him work on earning his high school equivalency diploma. though tommy is a good student, he is still frustrated when he takes the exam itself, crumpling it up and tossing it in the trash. andy retrieves it and sends it in anyway red tells tommy about andy's case. tommy is visibly upset at hearing andy's story and tells andy and red that he had a cellmate in another prison who boasted about killing a man who was a professional golfer at the country club he worked at, along with his lover. the woman's husband, a banker, had gone to prison for those murders. when andy informs norton, the warden refuses to act. although andy promises to keep the money laundering a secret, the warden becomes furious and orders him to solitary for a month. the inmates discuss the sentence mentioning it is the longest time in solitary that they've ever heard of. they also realize that andy may truly be innocent after all and has spent almost 20 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. tommy receives a letter from the board of education announcing that he has passed the exam and now owns a high school diploma. a guard pass the news to andy in his solitary cell which makes him smile a little. one night, tommy is escorted outside at night to have a private meeting with the warden. warden norton asks him if the story he told andy is true and if he would be willing to testify on andy's behalf. tommy enthusiastically agrees. the warden smiles at him before nodding to hadley to shoot him dead. when the warden visits andy in solitary, he tells him that tommy tried to escape and that hadley had no choice but to shoot him. andy doesn't buy that story and tells norton that ''everything'' stops and that he's not going to work for him anymore. the warden threatens andy to shut down the library, burn all the books, and move andy to a much different cell in a much different part of the prison with the most hardened criminals should he stop working for him. he then leaves and orders andy to another month in solitary to think about things. a disheveled andy is released from solitary confinement after two months. andy tells red if he's ever freed or escapes, he'd like to go to zihuatanejo, a beach town on the pacific coast of mexico. he also tells red how he got engaged. he and his future wife went up to a farm in buxton, maine, to a large oak tree at the end of a stone wall. he tells red that, if he should ever be paroled, he should look for that field, and that oak tree. red worries that andy is suicidal, especially after learning that he asked a fellow inmate for a rope. the next day andy escapes. at the next day's roll call, the guards find andy's cell empty. an irate norton throws a rock at the poster hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel. andy has used the pick to dig tiny amounts of dirt each to create the tunnel over 20 years. the previous night, andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking with him norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing evidence of the money laundering and corruption at shawshank. andy walks into the maine national bank in portland, where he had put warden norton's money. using his assumed identity as randall stephens, and with all the necessary documentation, he walked out with a cashier's check. he continues his visitations to nearly a dozen other local banks, ending up with some $370,000. he also exposes norton before disappearing. hadley is arrested & norton commits suicide. at red's next parole hearing in 1967, he talks to the parole board about how \"rehabilitated\" was a made-up word, and how he regretted his actions of the past. his parole is granted this time, but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. remembering his promise to andy he follows andy's instructions, hitchhiking to buxton and arriving at the stone wall andy described. just like andy said, there was a large black stone. under it was a small box containing a large sum of cash and instructions to find him. he said he needed somebody \"who could get things\" for a \"project\" of his. red violates parole and leaves the halfway house, unconcerned since no one would really do an extensive manhunt for \"an old crook like [him].\" he takes a bus to fort hancock, where he crosses into mexico. the two friends are finally reunited on the beach of zihuatanejo on the pacific coast, and share a happy embrace."

Neo learns the Matrix is a simulated reality created by intelligent machines, which harvest human energy from pods while the real world lies devastated. He is unplugged from the system, trained in martial arts and control of the Matrix, and given a choice between a red pill and blue pill. He joins Morpheus, Trinity, and the crew aboard the Nebuchadnezzar to fight the Matrix’s agents. Neo discovers the true stakes: the war between humans and machines, with Zion as humanity’s last city. After intense training, street-level battles, and a betrayal by Cypher, Neo embraces his potential as The One, rescues Morpheus from capture, and defies the Matrix’s rules, dodging bullets and bending its physics. In a final confrontation, Neo sacrifices himself, is revived by Trinity’s kiss, and gains power to subvert the Matrix, vowing to reveal to all trapped minds that anything is possible.",

      "in 1999, in an unnamed city, computer programmer thomas anderson (keanu reeves) is secretly a hacker known as \"neo\". he is restless, eager and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to the \"matrix\" appearing on his computer.\na woman named trinity is observing neo, and she does so knowing that morpheus believes that neo is \"the one\". during one of her forays, trinity is tracked down by the local police to her hotel room. outside the hotel a car drives up and three agents appear in neatly pressed black suits. they are agent smith (hugo weaving), agent brown (paul goddard), and agent jones (robert taylor). trinity calls morpheus and says that her line was tracked and morpheus orders her to find another exit.\ntrinity easily defeats the six policemen sent to apprehend her, using fighting and evasion techniques that seem to defy gravity. a fierce rooftop chase ensues with trinity and an agent leaping impossibly from one building to the next, astonishing the policemen left behind. trinity makes a daring leap across an alley and through a small window. trinity makes it to a public phone booth on the street level. the phone begins to ring. as she approaches it a garbage truck, driven by agent smith, careens towards the phone booth. trinity makes a desperate dash to the phone, picking it up just moments before the truck smashes the booth into a brick wall. the three agents find no body in the wreckage. \"she got out,\" one says. the other says, \"the informant is real.\" \"we have the name of their next target,\" says the other, \"his name is neo.\" notices about a manhunt for a man named morpheus scroll across neo's screen as he sleeps. suddenly neo's screen goes blank, and a series of text messages appear: \"wake up, neo.\" \"the matrix has you.\" \"follow the white rabbit.\" a group of ravers comes to neo and neo gives them a contraband disc he has secreted in a copy of \"simulacra and simulation.\" the lead raver asks him to join them and neo demurs until he sees the tattoo of a small white rabbit on the shoulder of a seductive girl in the group. trinity approaches neo at the rave bar. neo recognizes her name as she was a famous hacker and had cracked the irs database.\na female hacker named trinity (carrie-anne moss) confirms that a man named morpheus (laurence fishburne) can help him. neo works at metacortex, a leading software company housed in an ominous high rise. at his desk, neo finds a package with a phone, which rings. on the other end is morpheus, who informs neo that they've both run out of time and that \"they\" are coming for him. morpheus tells him to slowly look up, toward the elevator. agents smith, jones, and brown are there, obviously looking for him, as a woman points towards neo's cube. three sinister agents, led by agent smith (hugo weaving), come to arrest neo and attempt to prevent him from collaborating with morpheus. morpheus guides neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements. morpheus tries to guide neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof neo rejects morpheus' advice, allowing himself to be taken by the agents. the agents interrogate neo about morpheus, but he refuses to cooperate. agent smith asks him to help them capture morpheus, considered a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty. neo gives them the finger and asks for his phone call. in response, neo's mouth suddenly seals shut, and the agents implant a robotic device in his abdomen. neo awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare. neo awakens with a start in his own bed. morpheus is on the other line. morpheus tells neo he is the one and to meet him at the adams st. bridge. there he is picked up by trinity and two others in a car. a woman in the front seat, switch (belinda mcclory) uses a device to remove the probe that neo believed had been part of a nightmare. trinity drops the bug out into the road where it slowly goes dark in the rain.\ntrinity and her allies bring neo to morpheus, their leader. undeterred, neo meets with morpheus. morpheus offers neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life. neo agrees to follow him by swallowing an offered red pill. as the rest of morpheus's crew straps him into a chair, neo is told that pill he took is part of a trace program, to \"disrupt his input/output carrier signal\" so that they can pinpoint him.\nopting for the red pill, neo's reality distorts, and he awakens submerged in a liquid-filled, mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body. he is hairless and naked, with thick black tubes snaking down his throat, plugged into the back of his skull, his spine, and invading most of the rest of his body. neo is connected along with thousands of other people to an elaborate electrical structure. suddenly a menacing, hovering nurse robot grabs him by the throat. the cable inserted into the base of his skull suddenly detaches. the rest of the tubes pop off his limbs and neo is flushed down a tube into an underground pool of filthy water. just as he's about to drown in the muck a hovercraft appears above him, snags him and hauls him into its cargo bay. he is rescued by morpheus and brought aboard a levitating ship called the nebuchadnezzar. morpheus's crew includes trinity, apoc (julian arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair, switch, cypher (bald with a goatee), two brawny brothers, tank (marcus chong) and dozer (anthony ray parker), and a young, thin man named mouse (matt doran). morpheus gets to the point. \"you wanted to know about the matrix,\" he says, ushering him to a chair. neo sits down in it and trinity straps him in. a long probe is inserted into the socket at the back of neo's skull. neo wakes in a world of all white. he is in the construct, a \"loading platform\" that morpheus and his team use to prepare newly freed humans to deal with the matrix world. gone are the sockets in neo's arms and neck and his hair is grown in. morpheus tells him that what he is experiencing of himself is the \"residual self image, the mental projection of your digital self\" and bids him to sit while he explains the truth. \"this,\" he says, showing an image of a modern city, \"is the world that you know.\" a thing that really exists \"only as part of a neural, interactive simulation that we call the matrix.\"\nmorpheus then shows neo the world as it truly exists today, a scarred, desolate emptiness with charred, abandoned buildings, black earth, and a shrouded sky. morpheus tells neo that the year is approximately 2199, and humans are fighting against intelligent machines that were created early in the 21st century and have since taken control of the earth's surface. humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations, leaving the earth a devastated ruin. as a last resort, humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines' access to solar power and, in response, the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bio-electric energy. a human's body provides \"more electricity than a 120 volt battery and over 25k btus in body heat.\" morpheus shows neo fields where machines grow human beings, connecting them to their outlets, ensconcing them in their pods, and feeding them with the liquefied remains of other human beings. \"the matrix,\" says morpheus, \"is a computer-generated dreamworld created to keep us under control, to turn us\" into a mere power source, into copper-top batteries. the remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as zion, living a harsh existence on scarce resources.\nthe humans are kept docile within the matrix, a simulated reality of the world as it was in 1999. the matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak, designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified. that simulation is the world neo has been living in since birth. morpheus and his crew belong to a group of free humans who \"unplug\" others from the matrix and recruit them to their rebellion against the machines, and who are able to gain superhuman abilities within the matrix by using their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its physical laws. even so, they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful agents-sentient programs protecting the matrix-and dying in the matrix causes death in the real world. when the matrix was created there was a man born inside it who could create his own reality inside it. it was this man who set morpheus and the others free. when he died, the oracle (gloria foster) prophesied that he would return in another form. and that the return of the one would mean the destruction of the matrix.\nmorpheus liberated neo because he believes him to be \"the one\", a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the matrix and liberate humanity by ending the war with the machines. the next day neo starts his training. tank is his operator. tank and his brother dozer are \"100% pure old-fashioned, homegrown human. born in the real world; a genuine child of zion.\" zion, tank explains, is the last human city, buried deep in the earth, near the core, for warmth. tank straps neo back into the jack-in chair, by-passes some preliminary programs and loads him up with combat training, starting with jiu jitsu. neo is fed a series of martial arts techniques including kempo, tae kwon do, drunken boxing and kung fu. morpheus and tank are amazed at neo's ability to ingest information, but morpheus wants to test neo. morpheus and neo stand in a sparring program. the program has rules, like gravity. but as in many computer programs, some rules can be bent while others can be broken. morpheus bids neo to hit him, if he can. they fight with neo impressively attacking but morpheus easily parrying and subduing him. morpheus ends up kicking neo into a beam, explaining to him that the reason he has beaten him has nothing to do with muscles or reality. neo finally brings a punch near his teacher's face. a \"jump\" program is loaded. both men now stand on one of several tall buildings in a normal city skyline. morpheus tells neo he must free his mind and leaps easily but impossibly from one building to the next. neo nervously tries to follow him and doesn't make the jump, falling to the pavement below.\nmorpheus and neo are walking down a standard city street in what appears to be the matrix. morpheus explains that the matrix is a system and that the system is their enemy. all the people that inhabit it, the people they are trying to free, are part of that system. some are so inert, so dependent upon the matrix that they can never be free. neo asks what the agents are. \"sentient programs,\" says morpheus, that \"can move in and out of any software hard-wired into their system, meaning that they can take over anyone in the matrix program. \"inside the matrix,\" morpheus says, \"they are everyone and they are no one.\" thus morpheus and his crew survive the agents by running from them and hiding from the agents even though they \"are guarding all the doors. they are holding all the keys and sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.\" but no one who has ever stood up to an agent has survived; all have died. still, morpheus is certain that because the agents live in a world of rules that they can never be as strong, never be as fast as he can be. \"what are you trying to tell me,\" asks neo, \"that i can dodge bullets?\" \"when you're ready,\" morpheus says, \"you won't have to.\" the nebuchadnezzar is on alert. they see the holographic image of a squiddy, a search and destroy sentinel, which is on their trail. they set the ship down in a huge sewer system and turn off the power. tank stands at the ready switch of an emp, electro-magnetic pulse, the only weapon man has against the machines in the real world. two squiddies search for the ship -- the crew can see them -- but they move on. cypher meets with agent smith inside the matrix. smith says he wants access codes to the mainframe in zion. cypher says he can't do that, but that he can get him the man who does, meaning morpheus. the deal is that the machines to reinsert his body into a power plant, reinsert him into the matrix, and he'll help the agents. the group enters the matrix to visit the oracle, who predicted the emergence of the one. as they walk out of a warehouse cypher secretly throws his cell phone into the garbage. the oracle, morpheus explains, has been with them since the beginning of the resistance. she is the one who made the prophecy of the one and that morpheus would be the one to find him.\nthe oracle implies that neo is not the one but warns that neo must soon choose between his life and that of morpheus. the group is ambushed by agents and tactical police, leading to the death of the crew member mouse (matt doran). morpheus allows himself to be captured to let neo and the crew escape. their ally cypher (joe pantoliano) had betrayed them.\nmeanwhile, cypher exits the matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others, killing them. before cypher can kill neo and trinity, tank (marcus chong), a subdued crew member, regains consciousness, kills cypher, and safely extracts the survivors. the agents drug and interrogate morpheus in an attempt to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in zion, the humans' subterranean refuge in the real world. he informs morpheus, who is tied to a chair, that the first matrix was designed as a utopia, engineered to make everyone happy. \"it was a disaster,\" says agent smith, people wouldn't accept the program and \"entire crops were lost.\" \"some believed,\" continues smith, \"that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. but i believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was redesigned.\" tank is performing what amounts to last rites for morpheus, laying one hand on his head as his other moves to the back of his skull to remove the jack. just as he's about to pull it out neo stops him. he realizes that the oracle was right. he now has to make the choice to save himself or to save morpheus; his choice is to head back into the matrix. trinity rejects the idea. morpheus gave himself up so that neo could be saved since he is the one. \"i'm not the one, trinity,\" neo says, relaying his understanding of the discussion with the oracle: she did not enlighten him as to whether he was the promised messiah. and, since morpheus was willing to sacrifice himself, neo knows that he must do that same. neo and trinity return to the matrix and rescue their leader; in the process, neo becomes more confident in his ability to manipulate the matrix and is ultimately able to dodge bullets fired at him. morpheus and trinity use a telephone to exit the matrix, but neo is ambushed by agent smith. he stands his ground and defeats smith but flees when the agent possesses another body. meanwhile, in the real world \"sentinel\" machines converge on the nebuchadnezzar. just before reaching another exit, neo is shot and killed by agent smith. trinity, who is standing over neo in the real world, whispers that the oracle told her she would fall in love with the one. she kisses neo and restores his life. neo revives with new power to perceive and control the matrix, and effortlessly destroys agent smith, before returning to the real world in time for the ship's emp weapon to destroy the attacking sentinels. the film ends with neo back in the matrix, making a telephone call promising that he will demonstrate to the people imprisoned in the matrix that \"anything is possible.\" he hangs up the phone and flies into the sky."

    "overview": "a thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a ceo, but his tragic past may doom the project and his team to disaster.",
    "synopsis": "Cobb, a skilled extractor, enters shared dreamscapes to pull secrets from targets’ subconsciouses. Offered a chance at redemption, he must perform inception: plant a simple idea in the mind of Robert Fischer, heir to a vast energy empire, to dissolve his father’s company. Cobb assembles a specialized team—Arthur, Eames, Ariadne, and Yusuf—plus mentor Saito, who finances the mission and surrounds it with risk. The plan layers dreams: a sedimented hotel, a deeper snow fortress, and a final mountainous stronghold, each requiring a synchronized “kick” to wake the dreamers. As they dive deeper, Fischer’s subconscious defenses cohere; they dodge enemy projections and internal sabotage. Personal demons intrude: Cobb’s memories of his dead wife Mal threaten the mission, especially as Ariadne questions Cobb’s control. A failed kick strands the team and destroys progress; Saïto is gravely wounded, and Mal’s projection sabotages Fischer, pushing the action toward limbo, a shared, undefined subconscious world. In limbo, Cobb confronts his past with Mal, revealing that he spent decades there; he returns to reality after reuniting with his team. Back in the waking world, Fischer accepts that his father’s will is to become his own man, allowing the mission to influence his corporate choices. The team completes the inception and awakens, while Cobb faces an ending whose certainty remains ambiguous, choosing to focus on his family rather than the spinning top that might prove reality.",

      "dominick \"dom\" cobb (leonardo dicaprio) and business partner arthur (joseph gordon-levitt) are \"extractors\", people who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while experiencing shared dreaming. their latest target is japanese businessman saito (ken watanabe). the extraction from saito fails when sabotaged by a memory of cobb's deceased wife mal (marion cotillard). after cobb's and arthur's associate sells them out, saito reveals that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of \"inception\": planting an idea in a person's subconscious. in order to break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor maurice fischer (pete postlethwaite), saito wants cobb to plant the idea of dissolving the company into the mind of fischer's heir, son robert fischer (cillian murphy). should cobb succeed, saito tells cobb he will use his influence to clear cobb of a murder charge, which will allow cobb to return home and to his children. cobb accepts saito's offer. cobb sets about assembling his team: eames (tom hardy), a conman and identity forger; yusuf (dileep rao), a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable \"dream within a dream\" strategy; ariadne (elliot page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and arthur. saito insists on accompanying the team to verify the team's success. when the elder fischer dies in sydney, robert fischer accompanies the body on a flight back to los angeles, which the team uses as an opportunity to isolate fischer. cobb sedates him, bringing him into a shared dream with the extractors. using a \"dream within a dream\" strategy, at each level in the layered dreaming, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members who have entered another dream layer deeper. due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during the mission will result in entering limbo, an expanse of infinite raw subconscious. limbo is a space not dreamed by any one individual but is shared space where one mind can make drastic alterations of any kind. in the first level, yusuf's rainy downtown dream, the team abducts fischer; however, fischer's trained subconscious projections attack, wounding saito severely. eames temporarily takes the appearance of fischer's godfather, peter browning (tom berenger), to suggest fischer reconsider his father's will. yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by arthur. here, the extractors recruit fischer, convincing him that his kidnapping was orchestrated by browning and that they are fischer's subconscious dependency. in the third level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by eames, fischer is told they are in browning's subconscious, but they are really going deeper into fischer's. yusuf, under assault in the first level, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, removing the gravity of arthur's dream world and causing an avalanche in eames' dream, a kick which all missed. arthur improvises a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in eames' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks. saito succumbs to his wounds, and cobb's projection of mal sabotages the entire plan by killing fischer, sending them both into limbo. cobb and ariadne enter limbo to find fischer and saito, while eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. cobb reveals to ariadne that he spent \"50 years\" with mal in limbo constructing a world from their shared memories while seemingly growing old together. returning to the waking world, cobb and mal found less than three hours had passed. convinced she was still dreaming, mal committed suicide and tried to persuade cobb to do so too, by incriminating him in her death. facing a murder charge cobb fled the u.s., leaving his children behind, ostensibly in the shared care of his mother- and father-in-law, prof. stephen miles (michael caine). through his confession, cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in limbo to search for saito. ariadne pushes fischer off a balcony, resuscitating him at the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his \"own man\", and that splitting up the conglomerate might not be a radical notion. all team members other than cobb and saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: ariadne jumps off a balcony in limbo, eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in yusuf's dream hits the water. cobb eventually finds an aged saito in limbo and the two remember their arrangement, presumably shooting themselves and waking to outer-world reality back on the airplane, where the entire team and robert fischer have awakened. upon arriving in los angeles, cobb successfully passes through u.s. customs to his waiting father-in-law, who reunites him with his children. cobb attempts to determine if he is dreaming or awake by spinning a top but ignores its outcome to instead happily greet his family."

Two German couriers are killed, their letters of transit stolen, and Rick hides the letters in a piano.

German Major Strasser and Captain Renault push to arrest suspects; Ugarte is arrested for the letters. Ilsa urges Rick to help Laszlo reach safety, but Rick initially refuses to “stick his neck out.” Laszlo seeks an exit visa; Renaut and Strasser press for control of the situation. Rick negotiates safety and tactics, ultimately selling his cafe to Ferrari to facilitate Laszlo and Ilsa’s departure. Rick engineers Renaut’s release of Laszlo, ensures the couple’s escape at the airport, and confronts Strasser, shooting him to prevent interference. Renault sides with Rick, advising the police to arrest “the usual suspects” rather than him. In the end, Laszlo and Ilsa depart for the free French garrison in Brassaville; Rick remains in Casablanca with Renault, pursuing a new alliance and beginning a “beautiful friendship.”",

      "during world war ii, casablanca, french morocco is a waiting point for throngs of desperate refugees fleeing nazi-occupied europe. exit visas, which are necessary to leave the country, are at a premium, so when two german couriers carrying letters of transit signed by free french resistance fighter general charles degaulle are murdered and the letters stolen, the local authorities are sent to arrest all strangers in the city. german major heinrich strasser (conrad veidt), a high ranking nazi officer, arrives in casablanca where he is greeted at the local airfield by captain louis renault (claude raines), the prefecture of police. both of them talk about the two missing transit visas and are eager to find the documents. strasser is particularly concerned that the letters not be sold to victor lazlo, the well-known czech resistance leader, who is rumored to be on his way to casablanca. that night, renault and strasser search for the killer at rick's café americain, a popular nightclub run by the mysterious american expatriate richard 'rick' blaine (humphrey bogart). while having a drink by himself in the gambling room, rick is approached by ugarte (peter lorre), a shady dealer in exit visas, who asks rick to hold the stolen letters temporarily, explaining that he has a buyer for them and with the money from their sale, he plans to leave casablanca. rick hides the two exit visas in a piano being played by his bandmaster sam (dooley wilson). rick is approached by ferrari (sydney greenstreet), the owner of the blue parrot nightclub, with an offer to buy out rick, who refuses. ferrari is also revealed to sell forged exit visas at high prices. aside from sam, rick's only friends are his employees whom include the maitre'd carl (s.z. sakall), and the russian bartender sascha (leonid kinskey). rick has a brief argument with yvonne (madeleine lebeau), a young frenchwoman with whom he had a short affair. rick orders sascha to stop serving her anymore drinks and has her escorted from the nightclub. outside the club, rick runs into captain renault who tells him about his plans to arrest the murderer of the two german couriers at the club. although rick fought on the side of the loyalists in spain during the civil war there, he has grown cynical, and when renault advises him not to interfere with ugarte's arrest, rick replies \"i stick my neck out for nobody.\" he makes a bet with renault, however, that lazlo will manage to leave casablanca despite german efforts to stop him. after ugarte is arrested and taken away in a dramatic show, lazlo (paul henreid) and his companion, ilsa lund (ingrid bergman), arrive at rick's. ilsa recognizes sam, the piano player, and while lazlo makes covert contact with the underground, ilsa insists that sam play the song \"as time goes by.\" reluctantly, sam agrees, and a furious rick, who had ordered him never to play the song again, emerges from his office to stop him. rick is taken aback when he sees ilsa, whom he knew in paris. ilsa wants to talk to rick, but he becomes so angry at her and he refuses to talk. later at night, after the café is closed, rick remembers his love affair with ilsa in a long flashback: after a brief happy time together in france one year earlier, the nazis invade france and, worried that rick will be in danger because of his record, ilsa advises him to leave the city. he refuses to go without her, and she agrees to meet him at the train station. instead of coming, though, she sends him a farewell note, and sam and rick leave just ahead of the nazis arrival in paris. rick's thoughts return to the present with ilsa's arrival at the café. she tries to explain her actions, but when a drunken rick accuses her of being a tramp, she walks out. the following day, lazlo and ilsa meet with renault at the police station and, there they learn that ugarte has been killed while in police custody after allegedly trying to escape. the following night, after rick helps a young romanian couple win enough money at roulette to allow them to leave the country, lazlo, suspecting that rick has the letters, asks to buy them. rick refuses and, when lazlo asks his reasons, suggests that he ask ilsa. downstairs, strasser and his officers have taken sam's piano and are singing a loud rendition of \"die wacht am rhein\". undeterred, lazlo approaches the band and orders them to play \"la marseillaise\". after an affirmative nod from rick, the band strikes up the song and soon the entire bar defiantly joins in, drowning out the germans. angered, strasser orders renault to close the bar. renault does as he's ordered on the grounds of illegal gambling. that night, while lazlo attends an underground meeting, ilsa meets rick and explains that she stayed behind in paris because, on the day rick left the city, she had learned that lazlo, her husband, whom she had married in secret and thought dead, was alive. now realizing that they still love each other, ilsa tells rick that he must make decisions for both of them. meanwhile, the police break up the underground meeting, and lazlo takes refuge at rick's. before he is arrested, he begs rick to use the letters to take ilsa away from casablanca. the next day, rick sells the café to his competitor ferrari, and tricks renault into releasing lazlo from prison. they head for the airport, but renault has managed to alert strasser, who hurries after them. at the airport, rick tells ilsa, who thought that she would be staying with him, that she is to leave with lazlo because she gives meaning to his work. he then tells lazlo about his time with ilsa in paris, and that she pretended she was still in love with him in order to get the letters. lazlo, who understands what really happened, welcomes rick back to the fight before he and ilsa board the plane. strasser arrives just as the airplane is about to take off and when he tries to delay the flight, rick shoots him. renault then quickly telephones the police, but instead of turning in rick, he advises them to \"round up the usual suspects.\" in the final shot, rick and renault watch the plane take off with lazlo and ilse on board, and as they walk away together on the airport runway, the two men make plans to leave casablanca for the free french garrison at brassaville down on the african coast where they will get visas to travel to the usa. the film ends with rick stating \"louie, i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\""

      "the film consists of four major sections, all of which, except the second, are introduced by superimposed titles. the dawn of man\na tribe of herbivorous early humans is foraging for food in the african desert. a leopard kills one member, and another tribe of man-apes drives them from their water hole. defeated, they sleep overnight in a small, exposed rock crater, and awake to find a black monolith has appeared in front of them. they approach it shrieking and jumping, and eventually touch it cautiously. soon after, one of the man-apes (daniel richter) realizes how to use a bone as both a tool and a weapon, which they later use to kill prey for food. later they reclaim control of the water hole from the other tribe by killing its leader. triumphant, the tribe's leader throws his weapon-tool into the air as the scene shifts (via match cut) from the falling bone to an orbital satellite millions of years in the future. tma-1\na pan am space plane carries dr. heywood r. floyd (william sylvester) to a space station orbiting earth for a layover on his trip to clavius base, a us outpost on the moon. after making a videophone call from the station to his daughter (vivian kubrick), he encounters his friend elena (margaret tyzack), a russian scientist, and her colleague dr. smyslov (leonard rossiter), who ask floyd about \"odd things\" occurring at clavius, and the rumor of a mysterious epidemic at the base. the american politely but firmly declines to answer any questions about the epidemic. at clavius, floyd heads a meeting of base personnel, apologizing for the epidemic cover story but stressing secrecy. his mission is to investigate a recently found artifact-\"tycho magnetic anomaly one\" (tma-1)-\"deliberately buried\" four million years ago. floyd and others ride in a moonbus to the artifact, a black monolith identical to the one encountered by the apes. the visitors examine the monolith and pose for a photo in front of it. while doing so, they hear a very loud radio signal coming from the monolith. jupiter mission\neighteen months later, the american spaceship discovery one is bound for jupiter. on board are mission pilots and scientists dr. david bowman (keir dullea) and dr. frank poole (gary lockwood), and three other scientists who are in cryogenic hibernation. \"hal\" (voiced by douglas rain) is the ship's hal 9000 computer, which runs most of discovery's operations. while bowman and poole watch hal and themselves being interviewed in a bbc show about the mission, the computer states that he is \"foolproof and incapable of error.\" hal also speaks of his enthusiasm for the mission, and how he enjoys working with humans. when asked by the host if hal has genuine emotions, bowman replies that he appears to, but that the truth is unknown. hal asks bowman about the unusual mystery and secrecy surrounding the mission but interrupts himself to report the imminent failure of a device which controls the ship's main antenna. after retrieving the component with an eva pod, the astronauts cannot find anything wrong with it. hal suggests reinstalling the part and letting it fail so the problem can be found. mission control concurs but advises the astronauts that results from their twin hal 9000 indicate the ship's hal is in error predicting the fault. when queried, hal insists that the problem, like all previous issues with the hal series, is due to \"human error\". concerned about hal's behavior, bowman and poole enter one of the eva pods to talk without the computer overhearing them. they both have a \"bad feeling\" about hal, despite the hal series' perfect reliability, but decide to follow his suggestion to replace the unit. as the astronauts agree to deactivate the computer if it is proven to be wrong, they are unaware that hal is reading their lips through the pod's window. while attempting to replace the unit during a spacewalk, poole's eva pod, controlled by hal, severs his oxygen hose and sets him adrift. bowman, not realizing the computer is responsible for this, takes another pod to attempt a rescue, leaving his helmet behind. while he is gone, hal terminates the life functions of the crew in suspended animation. when bowman returns to the ship with poole's body, hal refuses to let him in, stating that the astronaut's plan to deactivate him jeopardizes the mission. bowman manually opens the ship's emergency airlock and bodily enters the ship risking death from lack of oxygen. after donning a helmet, bowman proceeds to hal 9000's memory core intent on disconnecting the computer. hal first tries to reassure dave, then pleads with him to stop, and finally begins to express fear-all in a steady monotone voice. dave ignores him and disconnects each of the computer's memory modules. hal eventually regresses to his earliest programmed memory, the song \"daisy bell\", which he sings for bowman. when the computer is finally disconnected, a previously recorded video message from floyd plays. in it, he reveals the existence of the four-million-year-old black monolith on the moon, \"its origin and purpose still a total mystery\". floyd adds that it has remained completely inert, except for a single, very powerful radio emission aimed at jupiter. jupiter and beyond the infinite\nat jupiter, bowman leaves discovery one in an eva pod and finds another monolith in orbit around the planet. approaching it, the pod is suddenly pulled into a tunnel of colored light, and a disoriented and terrified bowman finds himself racing at great speed across vast distances of space, viewing bizarre cosmological phenomena and strange alien landscapes of unusual colors. he finds himself, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, standing in a bedroom appointed in the louis xvi-style. bowman sees progressively older versions of himself, his point of view switching each time, alternately appearing formally dressed and eating dinner, and finally as a very elderly man lying in a bed. a black monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus-like being enclosed in a transparent orb of light. the new being floats in space beside the earth, gazing at it."

      "\"2001\" is a story of evolution. sometime in the distant past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well). evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moon's surface, where yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith placers that humankind has evolved that far. now mankind, assisted by artificial intelligence (such as hal), must dare to encounter the monolith placers. if successful, the next step in evolution--whatever it is--will be achieved.",
      "a black monolith has an affect on humans, the monolith's effects focusing on two specific time periods. the first period is four million years ago, at the dawn of man. after the appearance of the monolith, the ape men begin to display behavior unknown before then. the second period is the near future, in the year 2001. there are five astronauts aboard discovery one, which is on a mission to jupiter. at the beginning of the mission, the reason for it is unknown to the five astronauts. three of the astronauts are in hibernation at the start of the mission to preserve the manpower over its entire course, leaving mission commander dr. dave bowman and dr. frank poole as the two manning the spacecraft. there is another what is often considered \"sixth\" astronaut on board, hal 9000 - referred to simply as hal - the artificial intelligent computer which controls all of the craft's functions, including the systems keeping the three hibernating astronauts alive. hal is made all the more astronaut-like as it is given an artificial voice, hal and the astronauts often having conversations. a 9000 series computer is considered infallible, any error one has ever made being human caused. ultimately, bowman and poole believe that hal is malfunctioning, they are unaware that hal's behavior is due to knowledge of classified information it has about events at clavius, a lunar outpost, eighteen months earlier. however, the issue between the astronauts and hal becomes a fight for survival. the mission in its entirety has profound consequences for the human race.",
      "stanley kubrick's masterpiece traces an expedition to the moon, jupiter and beyond, and imagines the future evolution of humanity. a group of ape-like creatures - primitive humans - discover the use of bones as weapons in a quarrel over a waterhole. jump forward 1000s of years, and an american expedition finds a mysterious black monolith--an obvious alien artifact--on the moon. another expedition is sent to jupiter, where a second monolith has been discovered. but during the journey the ship's computer, hal 9000, develops paranoia.",
      "humanity discovers a mysterious monolith on the moon, which appears to be a signal to extraterrestrial intelligence. a mission to jupiter aboard the spacecraft discovery one, led by astronaut dave bowman, is complicated by hal 9000, the ship's ai, which begins malfunctioning and endangering the crew. bowman must confront hal, survive, and ultimately undergo a surreal transformation in the \"star gate\" sequence. the film explores human evolution, artificial intelligence, and the unknown possibilities of the cosmos in a visually striking and philosophical narrative."

    "synopsis": "Charles Foster Kane dies after whispering \"rosebud\" while holding a snow globe in Xanadu; a newsreel frames his life as the reporters seek meaning behind the word. Through interviews with Kane’s close circle—his second wife Susan Alexander Kane, friend Jedediah Leland, business manager Bernstein, and others—the narrative unfolds via flashbacks. Kane rises from poverty after a mine windfall funds his trust; at 25 he buys a newspaper and builds a vast empire through yellow journalism, sensationalism, and manipulation of public opinion, including influence over the Spanish–American War. He marries Emily Norton, niece of a future president, but political and personal failings lead to a broken marriage and a failed campaign for governor; he then coerces Susan into an opera career, which falters. After losing power and wealth, he becomes isolated in Xanadu, his fortune policed by Thatcher’s trust, and his ideals erode. In the present, the reporters piece together fragments of Kane’s life, yet the final meaning of rosebud remains unrevealed; the sled of his childhood, the symbol of innocence lost, is revealed only as burned relics in the furnace.",

      "in a mansion in xanadu, a vast palatial estate in florida, the elderly charles foster kane (orson welles) is on his deathbed. holding a snow globe, he utters a word, \"rosebud\", and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. a newsreel obituary tells the life story of kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. kane had humble beginnings but led a stellar life. he was twice divorced, and his business empire once contained 13 newspapers and radio stations across us. his palatial mansion xanadu was the most expensive private construction project after the pyramids. it had a private zoo. kane was legendary in his hatred for thatcher, who also claimed to be the trustee of kane's wealth from his parents. kane's political career was cut short due to a love scandal, & in his late years, he was alone, unloved and abandoned.\nkane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter jerry thompson (william alland) with discovering the meaning of \"rosebud\". thompson sets out to interview kane's friends and associates. he approaches kane's second wife (dorothy comingore), susan alexander kane, now an alcoholic who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker walter parks thatcher (george coulouris), also kane's legal guardian when he was young. through thatcher's written memoirs, thompson learns that kane's childhood began in poverty in colorado. in 1871, after a gold mine was discovered on her property, kane's mother mary kane (agnes moorehead) sends charles away to live with thatcher so that he would be properly educated. while thatcher and charles' parents discuss arrangements inside, the young kane (buddy swan) plays happily with a sled in the snow outside his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with thatcher. kane's mother made this decision as she was afraid that kane's father was a bum and he would squander away the money. so, she hands over control of the gold mine to thatcher's bank in exchange for all profits going into a trust, which would be given to kane when he turns 25.\nyears later, after gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of yellow journalism. he takes control of the new york inquirer and starts publishing scandalous articles that attack thatcher's business interests. thatcher is livid, kane continues to bleed to the extent of $ 1 mm per year to keep his newspaper going. after the stock market crash in 1929, kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to thatcher. back in the present, thompson interviews kane's personal business manager, mr. bernstein (everett sloane). bernstein recalls how kane hired the best journalists available to build the inquirer's circulation. kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the spanish american war and marrying emily norton (ruth warrick), the niece of a president of the united states. he grew the circulation of his paper from a modest 26,000 to an astounding 684,000, beating its top rival the chronicle. thompson interviews kane's estranged best friend, jedediah leland (joseph cotten), in a retirement home. leland recalls how kane's marriage to emily disintegrates more and more over the years (kane would not refrain from attacking the policies of the president and that would cause tension in the kane household), and he begins an affair with amateur singer susan alexander while he is running for governor of new york. both his wife and his political opponent (james gettys) discover the affair and the public scandal ends his political career. kane marries susan and forces her into a humiliating operatic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition (apparently susan told kane when they were dating that she always wanted to be a singer). back in the present, susan now consents to an interview with thompson, and recalls her failed opera career. kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. after years spent dominated by kane and living in isolation at xanadu, susan leaves kane. kane's butler raymond (paul stewart) recounts that, after susan leaves him, kane begins violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. he suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says, \"rosebud.\"\nback at xanadu, kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded. thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of kane's last word will forever remain an enigma. as the film ends, the camera reveals that \"rosebud\" is the trade name of the sled on which the eight-year-old kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in colorado. thought to be junk by xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace."

      "the commercial towing spaceship nostromo is on a return trip from thedus to earth, hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral ore, and carrying its seven-member crew in stasis. upon receiving a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer, mother (helen horton), awakens the crew.\nthe crew was returning with a full load of the ore and expected a large bonus upon arrival at earth. the crew still believes that they have been awakened as they are nearing their destination but get a rude jolt when they realize that they are not in the solar system.\nmother summons ship captain dallas for a private conversation and apprises him of the situation. dallas informs the crew that they are only halfway to earth. dallas says that the signal that mother intercepted was acoustical beacon which repeats at an interval of 12 seconds. following company policy (and a clause in everyone's contract) to investigate transmissions indicating intelligent life, they land on the planet. the crew does not have any choice as if they fail to comply it results in complete forfeiture of shares, which means that the crew gets no money. the crew detaches the nostromo from the refinery and lands on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship due to the planet's jagged terrain.\ncaptain dallas (tom skerritt), executive officer kane (john hurt), and navigator lambert (veronica cartwright) the nostromo's navigator, set out to investigate the signal's source while warrant officer ripley (sigourney weaver) the warrant officer, science officer ash (ian holm), and engineers brett (harry dean stanton) and parker (yaphet kotto) stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs. parker says that it will take 25 hours to repair the ship.\nthe atmosphere of the planet is almost primordial which high concentrations of methane and carbon-dioxide. the planet is hostile with high winds and flying debris, which drops the visibility down to only a few feet. dallas, kane, and lambert discover that the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft which is shaped like a horseshoe. the spaceship itself is huge with advanced equipment, well beyond the capabilities of humans. inside it they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been exploded outward from the inside. meanwhile, the nostromo's computer, mother, partially deciphers the signal transmission, which ripley determines to be some type of warning. the spaceship is very hot inside, even though the ship has been dead for a very long time (even centuries) as the alien creature found dead had been fossilized. kane discovers a vast chamber containing numerous eggs. the eggs are covered with a thin layer of mist and are activated when the mist is removed. kane can see that there is organic life inside the egg. when he touches one of the eggs, a spider-like creature springs out, penetrates his helmet, and attaches itself to his face. dallas and lambert carry the unconscious kane back to the nostromo. as the acting senior officer, ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations (which requires 24 hours of mandatory decontamination), but ash overrides her and allows the crew back into the ship. while parker and brett work on repairing the nostromo, ash attempts to remove the creature from kane's face. when ash tries to pull one of the creature's digits, it tightens its tail around kane's neck, strangling him.\nhe stops when he discovers that its highly corrosive acidic blood could harm kane and potentially damage the ship's hull. a small trickle of the creature's blood which dripped from a small incision was able to eat through 3 layers of decks on the ship.\neventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. with the ship repaired, the crew resume their trip back to earth. kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the creature by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and flamethrowers. brett follows the crew's cat into a large room where the now-fully-grown alien (bolaji badejo) attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts. dallas enters the ducts with a flamethrower, intending to force the creature into an airlock, but it attacks him. parker later finds only the flamethrower. lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people and insists on continuing dallas's plan to flush out the alien. while accessing mother, ripley discovers that the crew was awoken and directed to the planet because the company secretly ordered ash to return with the alien for study, and to consider the crew expendable. she confronts ash, who tries to kill her. parker intervenes, knocking ash's head loose and revealing him to be an android. the survivors reactivate ash's head, and he confirms the company's orders. ash states that the alien is not easily killed and expresses his admiration for it, taunting them about their chances of survival. ripley shuts him down and parker incinerates him. the crew decides to self-destruct the nostromo and escape in the shuttle. while gathering supplies, parker and lambert are killed by the alien. now alone, ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence, but the alien blocks her path to the shuttle. she retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct. she reaches the shuttle unhindered with jones, narrowly escaping as the nostromo explodes. as ripley prepares for stasis, she discovers the alien has stowed itself in a narrow compartment. she dons a spacesuit and flushes it out. it approaches ripley, but before it can kill her, she opens the airlock door. the resulting explosive decompression almost ejects the alien into space, but it hangs onto the door frame. ripley fires a grappling hook gun to push it out and activates the engines, blasting the alien into space. after recording her final log entry, she places jones and herself into stasis for the trip back to earth."

He tracks Leon, Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris, while uncovering their aim to locate Tyrell and extend their brief lifespans. Tyrell’s assistant Rachael, a replicant with false memories, challenges Deckard’s views as he tests her humanity; she appears human to him, and he grapples with feelings for her. Deckard's pursuit leads him to Sebastian, Tyrell’s designer, who helps Roy and Pris manipulate events to access Tyrell’s penthouse. Roy tortures and then kills Tyrell, while Pris confronts and is killed by Deckard. Roy duels Deckard on a rooftop, spares him briefly, and delivers a dying monologue before falling to his death. Deckard defeats the remaining pursuers, rescues Rachael, and leaves with her as the unicorn origami left by Gaff hints at unseen memories and a broader question of identity and humanity.",

      "in 2019, tyrell corporation has created a brand of robots, so similar to humans, they are called replicants. the replicants are virtually identical to humans. the nexus 6 replicants were superior in strength and agility and equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them. branded the nexus 6, the replicants are used in the off-world exploration of other planets and as slave labor. after mutiny by a group of nexus 6 replicas, they were declared illegal on earth, under penalty of death. the blade runner unit was formed to kill all remaining nexus 6 on earth.\nthe killings were called retirement, and not executions. in 2019, please live in huge, tall buildings, and had access to flying cars for transportation. the tyrell corporation is housed in a large pyramid-like structure. in los angeles in november 2019, ex-police officer rick deckard (harrison ford) is detained by officer gaff (edward james olmos), who likes to make origami figures, and brought to his former supervisor, bryant (m. emmet walsh). deckard, whose job as a \"blade runner\" was to track down bio-engineered beings known as replicants and \"retire\" them, is informed that four have come to earth illegally. bryant informs deckard that the replicants already killed humans on a shuttle while on their way to earth.\nas tyrell corporation nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to earth to try to extend their lives. bryant knew that the nexus 6 had tried to infiltrate the tyrell corporation building, but one of them electrocuted by the security systems and the other got away. so, bryant ordered the voight-kampff test to be administered just in case a nexus 6 tries to come in as an employee.\ndeckard watches a video of a blade runner named holden administering the \"voight-kampff\" test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. the test subject, leon (brion james), shoots holden (morgan paull) after holden asks about leon's mother. leon is now in custody. deckard cannot understand why the nexus 6 are coming back to the tyrell corporation. the nexus-6 were designed to develop basic emotions of their own in time, and hence the v-k was built in as a fail-safe to distinguish humans from replicants.\nbryant wants deckard to retire leon and the other three replicants: roy batty (rutger hauer), zhora (joanna cassidy), and pris (daryl hannah). deckard initially refuses, but after bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees. bryant has deckard meet with the ceo of the company that creates the replicants, eldon tyrell, so he can administer the v-k test on a nexus-6 to see if it works. tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant rachael.\nwhile there, he discovers that dr. eldon tyrell's (joe turkel) assistant rachael (sean young) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. rachael has been given false memories to provide an \"emotional cushion\". as a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant. events are then set into motion that pit deckard's search for the replicants against their search for tyrell to force him to extend their lives. roy and leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of j. f. sebastian (william sanderson), a gifted genetic designer who works closely with tyrell. rachael visits deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after deckard reveals that her memories are implants from tyrell's niece, she leaves his apartment in tears. meanwhile, pris locates sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust. while searching leon's hotel room, deckard finds a photo of zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where zhora works. deckard kills zhora and shortly after is told by bryant to also retire rachael, who has disappeared from the tyrell corporation. after deckard spots rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by leon, but rachael kills leon using deckard's dropped pistol. the two returns to deckard's apartment, and during an intimate discussion, he promises not to hunt her. as she abruptly tries to leave, deckard physically restrains her, forcing her to kiss him and she ultimately relents. deckard leaves rachael at his apartment and departs to search for the remaining replicants. arriving at sebastian's apartment, roy tells pris the others are dead. sympathetic to their plight, sebastian reveals that because of \"methuselah syndrome\", a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will also be cut short. sebastian and roy gain entrance into tyrell's secure penthouse, where roy demands more life from his maker. tyrell tells him that it is impossible. roy confesses that he has done \"questionable things\" which tyrell dismisses, praising roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. roy kisses tyrell, then kills him by crushing his skull. sebastian runs for the elevator followed by roy, who then rides the elevator down alone. though not shown, it is implied by bryant via police radio that roy also kills sebastian. upon entering sebastian's apartment, deckard is ambushed by pris, but he manages to kill her just as roy returns. as roy starts to die, he chases deckard through the building, ending up on the roof. deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof but misses and is left hanging precariously between buildings. roy makes the jump with ease, and as deckard's grip loosens, roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. as roy's life runs out, he delivers a monologue about how his memories \"will be lost in time, like tears in rain\". roy dies in front of deckard, who watches silently. gaff arrives and shouts across to deckard, \"it's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?\" deckard returns to his apartment and finds the door ajar, but rachael is safe, asleep in his bed. as they leave, deckard notices a small tin-foil origami unicorn on the floor, a familiar calling card that brings back to him gaff's final words. deckard and rachael quickly leave the apartment block."

      "in the early twenty-first century, the tyrell corporation, during what was called the nexus phase, developed robots, called \"replicants\", that were supposed to aid society, the replicants which looked and acted like humans. when the superhuman generation nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-earth colony, replicants became illegal on earth. police units, called \"blade runners\", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \"retiring\" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. it's now november, 2019 in los angeles, california. rick deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to earth, with their leader being roy batty. one, leon kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the tyrell corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. beyond following leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the tyrell corporation in trying to infiltrate it. the answer may lie with tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. beyond tracking the four, deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: rachael, who works as tyrell's assistant. the issue is that dr. elden tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. with those memories, rachael has no idea that she is not human. the problem is not only rachael's assistance to deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.",

      "in the near future, the police department forces former blade runner rick deckard (ford) out of retirement to hunt four genetically engineered humans who have escaped the colonies and returned to earth. designed to do difficult, hazardous work, the manufactured humans are stronger, faster and smarter than non-engineered humans.",

Weather and pursuit pressure push her to stop at the Bates Motel, run by quiet Norman Bates, who lives with his domineering mother upstairs. Marion spends the night, hides the money, and contemplates returning it; she is watched by Norman, who is controlled by his mother. That night, Marion is murdered in the shower by an unseen figure, later revealed as the mother-dominated Norman in a perverse attempt to both preserve and act through his mother. Norman disposes of the body, hides the cash, and retreats to his house; Sam and Marion’s sister Lila, plus private investigator Arbogast, search Fairvale for her. Arbogast uncovers the motel’s secrets and is killed by Mrs. Bates in the house. Sheriff Chambers and others question Norman, who maintains the facade of a mourning son. Lila and Sam eventually descend into the Bates house and discover the preserved corpse of Mrs. Bates in the cellar. Norman, under Mother’s influence, confronts them; a psychiatrist later explains Norman’s split personality: Norman Bates remains as a shell, while “Mother” dominates, having murdered Marion and others to protect the illusion of the mother he worshipped. The film ends with Norman/Mother isolated, as Marion’s car is tugged from the swamp by a tow chain, leaving the truth in the asylum of Norman’s mind.",

      "in a phoenix hotel room on a friday afternoon, marion crane ( janet leigh ) and her out-of-town lover sam loomis ( john gavin ) end a stolen lunchtime interlude with yet another disagreement about their future. marion wants to marry sam, but debts inherited from his father and his own alimony payments do not leave him enough money to support her as he would like. as they have done so often before on sam's business trips to phoenix, they part leaving their future uncertain. marion returns to the real estate office where she works as a secretary, arriving just ahead of her boss mr. lowery ( vaughn taylor ) and his client cassidy ( frank albertson ) who buys a house from lowery with $40,000 in cash. lowery tells marion to put the money in the safe deposit box at the bank until monday. pleading a headache, marion asks to take the rest of the day off after her errand to the bank. but marion doesn't go to the bank. on the spur of the moment, she decides to keep the money, packs a suitcase, and starts driving out of town, only to be spotted by her boss at an intersection where he gives her a suspicious look. worried that she has been found out already, she still proceeds out of town on her way to fairvale, california, where sam lives. all the while she keeps looking behind her, fearful that she's being followed. she drives well into the night and parks alongside the road to sleep. in the morning, a highway patrolman ( mort mills ) stops to investigate her stopped car, and awakens her. startled and nervous, she arouses the patrolman's suspicions. he looks at her license and registration, taking note of the plate number. he allows her to go on, but follows her for a while, which intensifies marion's agitation. realizing that her car can easily give her away, marion decides to trade it in for a different car. she stops in at a used car lot, hurriedly pays the salesman ( john anderson ) $700 cash for a likely substitute, and completes the deal as the same highway patrolman watches from across the street. nervous, she drives away and continues toward fairvale. as night falls on this second day, with her fears of pursuit crowding in around her, she drives into a rainstorm. unable to see the road clearly, she spots the lighted sign of the bates motel, and decides to take a room for the night. as there are no other cars there, and no one in the motel office, she honks her horn upon seeing a light on in the house behind the motel, and a silhouette in the window. someone dashes down the path to greet her, and he introduces himself as norman bates ( anthony perkins ). he is soft-spoken and shy young man who tells marion that he lives in the large house with his mother. he comments that the motel seldom has guests anymore since the new interstate bypassed the local highway, and marion realizes that she probably took a wrong turn in the storm. still nervous about being tracked by the police, marion registers under a false name, and norman checks her into cabin 1 just next to the office. when she asks about food, marion learns that fairvale is only fifteen miles away. norman offers to share his supper with her so she doesn't have to go out again in the rain, and he goes back to the house. she begins unpacking, taking time to wrap the money inside a newspaper which she sets aside on the bed table. then she overhears a shouted argument between norman and his mother coming from the house. mother bates seems to have a low opinion of young women, and doesn't want norman associating with them. norman returns to the motel with sandwiches and milk and invites marion to join him in the parlor just behind the check-in desk. marion is taken aback by the stuffed birds that fill the parlor, a product of his taxidermy hobby. in their conversation over sandwiches, norman talks about being trapped. just as marion presently feels trapped by her recent hasty decision, norman is more permanently trapped in his co-existence with his mother and her madness. but as norman observes, \"we all go a little mad sometimes.\" taking norman's situation as a cautionary tale, marion decides to return to phoenix to make amends, and try to pull herself out of the trap she's gotten herself into before it's too late. when marion goes back to her room, norman takes down a picture from the wall and looks through a peephole where he can watch marion changing. with a new burst of intensity, norman hurries up the hill and goes into the house. in her room, marion sits in her robe and calculates some figures, working out how she can repay the $700 she has already spent. then she tears up the paper containing the figures and flushes the pieces down the toilet. with newfound peace of mind, she slips out of her robe and slippers, and steps into the tub to enjoy a cleansing shower. unseen behind her, the bathroom door opens. a figure approaches and pulls back the shower curtain. it is the shadowy figure of an old woman wielding a large kitchen knife. marion screams. the blade lifts high into the air, and then strikes, and strikes again and again. marion cannot escape the slicing blows of the knife. the savage attack continues, and then her killer leaves. marion sinks down, reaching for the shower curtain which rips under her weight, and she falls over the edge of the tub. the shower continues to run over her as her blood flows down the tub drain, her lifeless eyes fixed in a final hopeless stare. from the house, norman's voice yells out in shock, \"mother! oh, god! mother! blood! blood!\" he comes running down the hill and into marion's cabin to find the aftermath of mother's knife attack. he quickly cleans up the murder scene. he wraps marion's body in the shower curtain and places her in the trunk of her car, and gathers her belongings into the trunk as well. at the last moment he spots the newspaper on the bed table and tosses it into the trunk, not knowing that it contains the stolen money. he drives to a swamp near the motel, where he pushes the car in and watches it slowly disappear into the dark bog. one week later, sam loomis is sitting in the back office of his hardware store in fairvale, writing a note to marion. he has changed his mind, and if it's not too late he wants to marry her right away even if his finances are limited right now. marion's sister, lila crane ( vera miles ), comes into the store and asks if marion is there. sam tells her she isn't. a private investigator named arbogast ( martin balsam ) also enters the store and asks for marion's whereabouts. his interest is in recovering the stolen $40,000, which lila knew about, but sam did not. arbogast is convinced that marion is somewhere in this town close to her boyfriend, so he sets out on a search of hotels and boarding houses around fairvale to track her down. when arbogast gets to the bates motel, norman tells him he hasn't seen marion, and that there haven't been any guests in weeks. but arbogast manages to look at the register and sees the false signature in marion's handwriting. caught in his lie that here hadn't been any recent guests, norman admits to remembering her now, and says she stayed that saturday night and left early on sunday morning. arbogast spots mother's silhouette sitting at the window of the house and asks to see her, but norman refuses, saying that his mother is an invalid and shouldn't be disturbed. when norman lets slip his mother's impressions of marion, arbogast becomes determined to talk to her, but norman insists that he leave. arbogast phones sam and lila to tell them that marion had registered the previous saturday night at the bates motel in cabin 1, and that he means to sneak back and talk to mrs. bates regardless of norman's objections. when he gets back to the motel, arbogast looks into the office and the parlor briefly to see if norman is there, and spots the motel safe which is standing open. then he heads up to the house and goes inside. sensing that no one is downstairs, he starts up the stairs. as he nears the top of the landing, mother bates emerges from the bedroom and stabs him. he stumbles backwards down the stairs and falls to the floor, where he is set upon and stabbed yet again. at the hardware store, lila and sam have been waiting for arbogast, who was supposed to return hours ago. sam tells lila to stay behind while he goes out to the motel. when he gets there, he calls out but no one answers. norman, standing by the swamp after having just disposed of the investigator's remains, hears sam call out for arbogast. sam returns to the store, having seen no one at the motel or the house. no arbogast, no bates, \"only a sick old lady unable or unwilling to answer the door.\" sam suggests they go see sheriff chambers ( john mcintire ) to report the missing arbogast. at the sheriff's house, chambers and his wife ( lurene tuttle ) listen to sam and lila tell their story. at their urging, chambers phones the motel and talks to norman, who says that the detective had been there but had left. when lila presses chambers about the mother, chambers tells them that norman's mother has been dead and buried for the past ten years, having poisoned her lover and herself in the only murder-suicide in fairvale's living memory. but sam and lila insist that there is an old woman out there, and that arbogast had told them that norman wouldn't let arbogast see his mother because she was too ill. that makes the sheriff wonder, if norman's mother is up there at the motel, then who is buried in that grave in green lawn cemetery? back at the motel, norman is worried about all the people who have been snooping around. after the phone call from sheriff chambers, norman goes up to his house and voices his concerns which leads to another unseen argument with mother in which he tells her she should hide in the fruit cellar for a few days. she refuses. norman says he will pick her up and carry her downstairs. she berates him, but in spite of mother's protests to be put down, norman carries his mother down the stairs. the next morning, sunday morning, lila and sam meet sheriff and mrs. chambers coming out of church. the sheriff has already been to the motel before church services. he didn't see anything strange and suggests that the detective probably just moved on to pursue a lead without telling them. he offers to help lila report a missing person and a theft, and let the law find her sister. unsatisfied, lila and sam decide to go out to the motel for themselves. their plan is to register as husband and wife and check into a cabin. then they will search the place more thoroughly. norman assigns them to cabin 10, and sam insists on signing the register. as he pays and asks norman for a receipt, lila takes the key and goes ahead toward their cabin. on the way she checks that the door to cabin 1 is unlocked. after a brief stop in cabin 10 to talk matters over, and after they are sure norman is not nearby, sam and lila enter cabin 1 to search for clues. sam notices that the shower curtain is missing and lila finds a scrap of paper with something subtracted from $40,000, suggesting that norman possibly knew about the money. lila wants to talk to the woman in the house because she might have told arbogast something. she wants sam to distract norman while she goes to the house. sam tries to dissuade her, but she insists she can handle a sick old woman. sam finds norman in the office and engages him in conversation, while lila circles around behind the motel to the house. she enters and looks through all the rooms upstairs. she goes into mother's bedroom, filled with furnishings and clothes from the victorian era but strangely preserved as if new. the outline of a woman's body is deeply impressed into the old mattress. she looks into norman's bedroom, another room frozen in time containing the toys and small bed of a child. meanwhile, sam has been trying to get norman to talk about money, looking for some indication that norman has the stolen cash. norman begins to grow agitated. when sam mentions norman's mother, norman realizes that his other guest may be snooping around at the house. sam tries to keep norman from leaving, and they struggle. norman knocks sam over the head, and sam falls dazed to the floor. lila is just coming down the stairs when she sees norman running toward the front door. she ducks around behind the stairs and partway down the cellar steps to avoid him. norman heads upstairs. lila starts to come back up, when she notices the cellar door at the bottom of the steps. this is a room she hasn't examined yet, and she risks the opportunity to look into it. walking through a storage room and into the barren fruit cellar beyond it, she sees an old woman sitting in a chair facing the far wall. she whispers, \"mrs. bates.\" but the woman doesn't respond. she taps the woman on the shoulder. the chair swivels around to reveal the desiccated remains of an old woman's corpse, her face contorted into a near-skeletal grin and seemingly staring out of eyeless sockets. lila screams and turns away, and her flinching reaction sets the bare hanging light bulb to swinging. at that moment, the living semblance of an old woman enters at the door wielding a large knife, blocking the only escape route from the cellar. in the next moment, sam's timely arrival saves lila, as he subdues the would-be assailant from behind. the \"woman's\" wig falls away to reveal norman bates dressed in the guise of his mother. that evening, lila, sam, and sheriff chambers are among a bewildered group of interested persons who sit in an office in the county court house, waiting to hear from a psychiatrist who has been called in to examine norman. the psychiatrist ( simon oakland ) enters to tell them he has gotten the whole story, but not from \"norman.\" he got it from norman's \"mother.\" as a personality, \"norman\" no longer exists. the other half, the \"mother\" half of norman's mind has completely taken over. the psychiatrist goes on to explain that after the death of norman's father, norman came to depend on the undivided attention of his mother. but when she took a lover, norman felt as if he had been replaced. his jealousy could not stand to share her. so he poisoned both his mother and her lover. consumed with guilt over his crime, he stole his mother's corpse and treated it to preserve it as best he could. to further the illusion that his mother was still alive, he began to divide his mind with his mother-- to think and speak for her. he walked around wearing her clothes and a woman's wig. at times he could be both personalities and carry on both sides of conversations. other times, the \"mother\" half, the dominant half, took over completely. \"he was never all 'norman,' but he was often only 'mother.'\" norman's \"mother\" personality was pathologically jealous of norman. when norman met marion, he felt a strong attraction to her. that attraction set off the jealous \"mother,\" and it was \"mother\" who killed marion-- and most likely, other women before her. in a locked and guarded room, the physical shell of norman bates sits unmoving as \"mother\"'s voice dominates his mind. she wants to prove to the world how harmless she is by sitting completely still. a fly crawls on norman's hand and he doesn't swat at it, simply smirks as the voice of mother's personality gloats that everyone must see that she wouldn't even harm a fly. in a final image, a tow chain begins pulling marion's car out of the bog. end of film"

A hypnotherapy session conducted by Rose’s mother, Missy, triggers a memory of his mother’s death and introduces Chris to a parasitic, hypnotic control. The party reveals a deeper conspiracy: Rose’s family harvests black bodies for white brains, transferring consciousness while leaving the original hosts trapped in a sunken place. Investigating, Chris discovers evidence linking Rose’s white relatives to other black individuals who suddenly behave unnaturally. When he tries to leave, Missy, Rose, and the father converge to perform the brain transplant. Chris incapacitates Jeremy, kills Dean and Missy, and fatally wounds Georgina during the escape attempt. He crashes the car while fighting Walter, who now hosts Rose’s grandfather’s brain, and is saved by Rod Williams, his TSA friend who arrives in a police car. Rod reveals he had been tracking the disappearances; he rescues Chris, while Rose lies gravely injured on the road.",

      "on a suburban street at night, an african american man walks alone, talking on the phone. a car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, the man starts to walk away. a person wearing a helmet, tackles and subdues the man, drags him into the car, and drives away. photographer chris washington (daniel kaluuya) reluctantly agrees to meet the family of his white girlfriend rose armitage (allison williams), unsure of a warm reception as they do not know that he is african american, and he does not want to shock them with his sudden appearance. chris is in excellent physical condition, is young and has an incredible skill of taking breathtaking photographs.\nrose assures chris that her parents are not racists. during their drive to the family's countryside estate, they hit a deer and report the incident. the white policeman asks for chris's identification even though he was not driving, but rose intervenes, and the encounter goes unrecorded. chris was more than happy to share his id with the policeman, but rose was indignant and alleged that chris was being profiled for being an african american while he had nothing to do with the deer incident. the policeman eventually relents and backs off. at the house, rose's white parents, neurosurgeon dean (bradley whitford) and psychiatrist/hypnotherapist missy (catherine keener), and her brother jeremy (caleb landry jones) make discomfiting comments about african american people. chris and rose had been dating for 4 months. dean's father was defeated by jesse owens in the trials for the berlin olympics. dean adds that he loved obama as a president and would have loved to see him get a third term.\nthe house is completed secluded, and the nearest neighbor is across a lake adjoining the property. jeremy shares embarrassing stories about rose at dinner. chris also observes eerie, unnatural behavior from the family's african american servants, georgina and walter. dean calls out the cliche of a white family having african american servants in the house to make light of the observation.\nchris shares that he never met his dad and his mother passed away when he was 11, so he has no family that looks out for him. chris notices that the african american workers at the estate are uncannily compliant. unable to sleep, chris goes outside to smoke and sees groundskeeper walter running from the woods. missy catches chris returning and talks him into a hypnotherapy session to cure his smoking addiction, using the noise of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger. in a trance, he recounts the death of his mother in a hit-and-run when he was a child, about which he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. he sinks into a void missy calls the \"sunken place\" where his body becomes temporarily paralyzed. he awakens believing he had a nightmare but realizes cigarettes now revolt him. the african american housekeeper georgina (betty gabriel) unplugs his phone, draining his battery. dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the armitages' annual get-together. they take an interest in chris, admiring his physique or expressing admiration for african american figures such as tiger woods. chris meets a blind art dealer, jim hudson, who takes an interest in his photography. chris meets logan king (lakeith stanfield), an african american man who also acts strangely, and who is married to a much older white woman. chris calls his friend, african american tsa officer rod williams (lil rel howery), about the hypnosis and the strange behavior at the house. when chris attempts to stealthily photograph logan, the camera flash causes logan to become hysterical, rushing at chris and frantically lashing out for him to \"get out\". logan is taken away by dean, who later claims logan had a seizure. away from the house, chris persuades rose to leave with him, while dean holds an auction with a picture of chris on display. chris sends logan's photo to rod, who recognizes him as andre, a missing man from brooklyn. while packing to leave, chris finds photos of rose in prior relationships with african american people, including walter and georgina, contradicting her claim that he is the first african american person she has dated. chris tries to leave, but rose refuses to give him the car keys. jeremy blocks the door and missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send chris back to the sunken place. chris awakens strapped to a chair. a video presentation featuring rose's grandfather roman (richard herd) explains that the family transplants the brains of white people into african american bodies. the consciousness of the host remains in the \"sunken place\", watching but powerless. jim hudson (stephen root), a blind art dealer says transplanting their brains into africa american people is the latest \"fad\", but clarifies that he does not care about chris's race and that he only wants chris's eyesight and his artistic talents. meanwhile, rod, who has been trying to contact chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they do not believe his theory about the armitages. missy attempts to hypnotize chris again, but chris plugs his ears with stuffing pulled from the chair, blocking the hypnotic commands. when jeremy comes to collect him for the surgery, chris bludgeons jeremy and then kills dean (who falls and accidentally sets fire to the room) and missy when she attacks him, before finishing off jeremy when he attacks again. chris tries to escape in jeremy's porsche but accidentally hits georgina, who has the brain of rose's grandmother, marianne. compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he picks her up, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and kill her. rose and walter, who has the brain of rose's grandfather, roman, arrive to capture chris. during a scuffle, chris uses his phone's flash to briefly free walter from roman's control. walter takes rose's rifle, shoots her, and fatally shoots himself. chris starts strangling rose, but cannot bring himself to kill her. a police car arrives and chris surrenders, but it's revealed to be rod. he picks up chris, leaving rose bleeding on the road."

      "chris and his girlfriend rose go upstate to visit her parents for the weekend. at first, chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.",
      "rose armitage is taking her boyfriend, chris washington, to meet her parents for the first time. he's a bit uneasy about how they'll treat him, as they're white and he's black. however, her parents turn out to be unfazed and everything seems to be going fine. chris then starts to notice some weird behavioral traits with the african-american staff at the house. the armitages throw a huge party and chris ends up in some awkward conversations with the guests. initially, he just puts it down to the racial difference, but then the guests', and armitages', motives start to appear more sinister. chris decides it is time to get out.",
      "having reached the major meet-the-parents milestone in his 5-month relationship with his lovely white girlfriend rose, talented young african-american photographer chris is on pins and needles. not knowing what to expect, chris arrives at their luxurious, secluded estate in the woods for the weekend. but except for rose, no one else knows that her boyfriend is black. of course, rose's psychiatrist mother and neurosurgeon father are cordial. however, after breaking the ice, chris senses an indistinguishable threat looming over the meeting. then, sheer dread follows, exposing the cryptic family's polite facade. as chris tries to understand, haunting questions arise. are rose's parents hiding something? and why is there a locked, off-limits room leading to the basement?",
      "a young african-american photographer by the name of chris washington is dragged out to his girlfriend's parents' house to spend the weekend and meet the family. chris feels unwelcome, considering there are only three other african-americans on the farm, and two of them work on it. as the weekend progresses, chris starts noticing some weird things around the farm and when he snaps a picture of one of the family members, the man freaks out. the sense of uneasiness is in the air and it continues to grow as chris finds out the strange truth of what is really going on in this place."

Max Rockatansky, a lone drifter, is captured and used as a blood donor after failing to protect a family. Imperator Furiosa, Joe’s lieutenant with an artificial arm, leads a daring escape with five of Joe’s wives aboard the armored War Rig. Furiosa seeks the Green Place, her childhood homeland, while Joe’s forces pursue relentlessly. Across brutal desert chases, Furiosa’s convoy alliances form with Max; they fight off marauders, survive a sandstorm, and lose a crew member. Nux, initially loyal to Joe, switches sides after aiding the chase and helps the group reach a swampland crossing toward the Vuvalini, an allied clan. The pursuit intensifies as Joe’s army closes in; Furiosa is wounded, and Joe is killed when Max and Furiosa turn the tide by destroying his control of the vehicle. After a climactic struggle, Nux sacrifices himself to block the canyon, and Max transfuses his blood to save Furiosa. They race toward a potential new home, but Max ultimately departs, sparing Furiosa a final farewell as she and the surviving group reach the citadel with new resolve and the promise of a safer future.",

      "following a nuclear holocaust, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. max rockatansky (tom hardy), a survivor, is captured by the war boys, the army of the tyrannical immortan joe (hugh keays-byrne) and taken to joe's citadel. max is haunted by nightmares of a woman and a child that he failed to protect. at the citadel, max's hair is shaved, and his vital information is tattooed on his back. max tries to escape but realizes that he is being inside a cave system of a stump like mountain with sheer drops to the surface on all sides. designated a universal blood donor, max is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for a sick war boy called nux (nicholas hoult).\nmeanwhile, imperator furiosa (charlize theron), one of joe's lieutenants with one artificial arm, is sent in her armored truck to trade produce and water for petrol and ammunition with two of his allies, the bullet farmer (richard carter) and the people eater (john howard) ruler of gas town.\njoe is an old man, who has blisters all over his body. he requires a special suit to protect his body and an oxygen mask that allows him to breathe. joe rules the population with an iron fist and controls them with limited release of water for consumption at periodic intervals. the water is stored in the mountain stump, and released for a few moments on orders of joe, for the teeming masses living below. when furiosa drives off-route, joe realizes that his five wives-women selected for breeding-are missing. joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farm. nux joins the pursuit with max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. meanwhile, furiosa's rig is attacked by buzzards in hostile territory. her own escort, who is not aware that furiosa has betrayed joe, helps her fight off the buzzards, but that's when joe and his forces catch up with furiosa.\na battle ensues between the truck and joe's forces. furiosa drives into a sandstorm, evading her pursuers, except nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the truck. max escapes and restrains nux, but the car is destroyed. after the storm, max sees furiosa repairing her truck, accompanied by the wives: capable (riley keough) the most level-headed and mature of the five, cheedo the fragile (courtney eaton) the meekest and most timid, toast the knowing (zoe kravitz) the most practical and intellectual of the five and is shown to have good knowledge of guns, the dag (abbey lee) an eccentric and bold personality, and the splendid angharad (rosie huntington-whiteley) joe's most \"treasured\" breeder, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with joe's child. max steals the truck, but its kill switch disables it. max begrudgingly agrees to help furiosa's group escape joe's wrath. nux sneaks onto the rig and attempts to kill furiosa, but the women overpower him and throw him out. nux who was left behind, is picked up by joe's army. furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon to barter a deal for safe passage. however, with joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block joe. joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the rig. he sends nux to carjack the rig.\nmax and furiosa fight pursuing bikers as joe's car, with nux now on board, surmounts the blockade and eventually attacks furiosa's truck, allowing nux to board. however, as the truck escapes, angharad falls off in an attempt to protect max and is run over by joe's car, mortally wounding her and her child. furiosa explains to max that they are escaping to the \"green place\", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. capable finds nux hiding in the truck, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. that night, the truck gets stuck in mud. furiosa and max slow joe's forces with mines, but joe's ally, the bullet farmer (richard carter), continues pursuing them. nux helps max free the truck while furiosa shoots and blinds the bullet farmer. max walks into the dark to confront the bullet farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition. moved by capable's compassion, nux joins the group and helps get the rig moving again. they drive the truck overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. max suspects a trap, but furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. the naked woman summons her clan, the vuvalini, who recognize furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the green place, now inhospitable. the vulvalini include the valkyrie (megan gale), the keeper of the seeds (melissa jaffer) and others (melita jurisic, gillian jones, joy smithers, antoinette kellerman, and christina koch). the group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended citadel, which has ample water and greenery that joe keeps for himself, and trap joe and his army in the bikers' canyon. the group heads back to the citadel, but they are attacked on route by joe's forces, and furiosa is seriously wounded. joe positions his car in front of the truck to slow it, while max fights joe's giant son, rictus erectus (nathan jones). joe captures toast, but she distracts him long enough for furiosa to rip off his breathing mask, killing him. nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the truck, killing rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing max, furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini to successfully escape in joe's car, where max transfuses his blood to furiosa to help her survive her injuries. at the citadel, the impoverished citizens are overjoyed at the sight of joe's corpse. furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the war boys, but max walks away, sharing a glance with furiosa before disappearing into the crowd."

    "synopsis": "In west Texas 1980, Llewelyn Moss, a hunter by trade, discovers a drug-deal massacre and a satchel of $2 million. He pockets the money, sends his wife away, and goes on the run, hoping to stay ahead of those who will kill for it. Anton Chigurh, a cold, precise hit man armed with a captive-bolt pistol and a tracking device in the satchel, is hired to retrieve the cash and methodically hunts Moss across the borderlands. Moss improvises, hides the cache in motel vents and a border ditch, and manages a few escapes, but Chigurh leaves a trail of killings in pursuit. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, a weary, traditional lawman, follows the carnage, contending with escalating violence and his own sense of impotence. Wells, another hired operative, is drawn into the chase as rival interests close in. After a chain of shootouts, Moss returns to retrieve the money, and Chigurh follows to a final confrontation; Moss dies in a hotel room, the cash recovered by Chigurh, who resolves to continue the pursuit. Bell, pondering retirement, contemplates the changing nature of violence while Carla Jean, Moss’s wife, faces a fatal coin toss when faced with Chigurh’s rule. The conclusion leaves Bell's retirement postponed and the money’s fate sealed among the deadly players and the unforgiving desert landscape.",

in the second, he and his father were riding horses through a snowy mountain pass. his father, who was carrying fire in a horn, quietly passed by with his head down, \"going on ahead, and fixing' to make a fire\" in the surrounding dark and cold. bell knew that when he got there his father would be waiting."

    "overview": "when sebastian, a pianist, and mia, an actress, follow their passion and achieve success in their respective fields, they find themselves torn between their love for each other and their careers.",
    "synopsis": "Mia, an aspiring actress in Los Angeles, and Sebastian, a dedicated jazz pianist, pursue their dreams while navigating harsh realities. Mia struggles with auditions, underwhelming reactions, and a partner who complicates commitments, while Sebastian defies a restaurant owner’s demand to play only safe setlists and battles with a desire to open a jazz club. They meet, clash, and grow closer through shared passion, trading moments of magic against the backdrop of a city that tests ambition. As their careers progress, both face choices that strain their relationship: Mia lands opportunities that pull her toward stardom, and Sebastian’s professional path shifts between steady gigs with a pop-influenced band and the dream of a personal club. A failed play, a skipped performance, and diverging timelines push them apart; yet a pivotal audition in Mia’s hometown, and the realization that they still love each other, rekindle a fragile hope. Five years later, Mia is a famous actress married to another man, while Sebastian has opened his own jazz club. A final, dreamlike encounter at his venue reaffirms what might have been, ending with a bittersweet glimmer of reunion.",

      "on a crowded los angeles highway (\"another day of sun\"), mia (emma stone), an on-studio barista and aspiring actress, has a moment of road rage with sebastian (ryan gosling), a struggling jazz pianist. mia was busy rehearsing her lines during a traffic jam and sabastian was right behind her when the traffic started moving. sebastian honks at mia's car and then flips her while driving past her. mia's subsequent audition goes poorly despite her efforts because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. that night, mia's roommates alexis (jessica rothe), caitlin (sonoya mizuno) and tracy (callie hernandez) take her to a lavish party in the hollywood hills to cheer her up (\"someone in the crowd\") promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. she has to take a long walk back after finding that her car has been towed. the same night, during a gig at a restaurant, sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner bill (j. k. simmons) to only play songs on the set-list. bill wanted sebastian to stick to christmas themed songs on the piano, but sebastian was passionate about jazz and felt that the restaurants had a \"one for you, one for me\" type of system. he argued that nobody in the restaurant would care about what he played, but bill was adamant. mia overhears the music as she passes by (\"mia and sebastian's theme\"). moved, she enters, but sebastian is promptly fired for his disobedience. as he storms out, mia attempts to compliment him, but he coldly brushes her off.\nsebastian has a sister named laura (rosemarie dewitt) who is very critical of his casual lifestyle. laura says that seb is living like a hermit and driving without insurance, both of which are not ok. mia continues to attend auditions in the meantime for various roles.\nmonths later, mia runs into sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band, and she teases him. after the gig, the two walk together to find their cars, lamenting being in each other's company despite the chemistry between them (\"a lovely night\"). while walking they come across a breath-taking view of the city from a high point. they are interrupted when mia receives a call from her boyfriend greg (finn wittrock) and this is also when they both find their cars. the next day, sebastian arrives at the barista where mia works. sebastian claims that he was at the studio for meetings. mia takes sebastian on a walk around the movie lot, explaining her passion for acting. she narrates how she lived with her aunt in boulder, colorado, and her house was across the street from a library. her aunt encouraged her to visit the library which had prints of old movies which she watched and recreated scenes of these movies back at home with her aunt. she left college to come to la to become an actress. sebastian takes mia to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and desire to open his own club. they warm to each other (\"city of stars\"). sebastian invites mia to a screening of rebel without a cause, which mia accepts, forgetting an earlier commitment with her current boyfriend. discontented with that date, she leaves and rushes to the theater, finding sebastian as the film begins. when the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, seb and mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the griffith observatory. after more failed auditions, mia decides, at sebastian's suggestion, to write a personal single-actress play. sebastian begins to perform regularly at the jazz club (\"summer montage\") and the two move in together. a high school classmate, keith (john legend), invites sebastian to be the keyboardist in his jazz band, which offers a steady source of income. sebastian is dismayed over the band's pop-oriented style but decides to sign with them after overhearing mia trying to convince her mother that sebastian is working on his career. mia attends one of their concerts (\"start a fire\") but is disturbed, knowing sebastian could not possibly enjoy his band's music. during the band's first tour, mia confronts sebastian over his future and goals. sebastian responds by claiming a steady career is what she wanted for him before accusing her of liking him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. insulted, mia leaves. on the night of mia's play, sebastian fails to show up due to a photo shoot he had forgotten about. the play fails, very few people attend, and mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, mia returns to her hometown of boulder city, nevada. one day, sebastian receives a call from a casting director who had attended mia's play, inviting mia to a film audition the following evening. knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to boulder city and finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, where she fell in love with acting. seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go. for the audition mia is simply asked to tell a story. she begins to sing about her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams (\"audition/the fools who dream\"). sebastian, confident that the audition was a success, asserts that mia must devote herself wholeheartedly to the opportunity. the two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship. five years later, mia is a famous actress and happily married to another man david (tom everett scott), with whom she has a daughter. one night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. noticing the seb's logo, she had once designed, mia realizes sebastian has finally opened his club. sebastian spots mia in the crowd. he begins to play their love theme (\"epilogue\"), prompting an extended dream sequence in which the two imagine what might have been had their relationship worked perfectly. the song ends and mia leaves with her husband. before exiting, she shares one last look with sebastian and smiles."

      "the story of aspiring actress mia and dedicated jazz musician sebastian, who struggle to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts. with modern-day los angeles as the backdrop, this musical about everyday life explores what more important: a once-in-a-lifetime love or the spotlight.",
      "in hollywood, mia and sebastian are struggling to make it in their respective respective careers, about which each has extreme passion. mia is an actress who dropped out of college and moved from small-town nevada five years ago to pursue her dream. she is enamored with old-tome hollywood - the movies she grew up on - but hates the cattle-herding feeling of going on auditions and her belief that she needs to schmooze at social events to get ahead in the business. sebastian is a jazz pianist, his style of jazz in the vein of traditionalists charlie parker and thelonious monk . he wants to do his part to preserve that tradition, especially as he knows that that style of music is dying. he has trouble emotionally playing music he doesn't like just to get a paying gig. he dreams of opening his own jazz club, most specifically in what used to be a famous jazz club that has since been converted to a tapas-bar-cum-salsa-dance-club. partly because of their individual struggles and partly because of the situations, their first few chance meetings are antagonistic. but they eventually become attracted to each other largely because of the passion for their dreams that they see in each other. but there are many obstacles to a happily-ever-after. they may be able to endure the struggling-artist life for so long before those struggles take their toll. the pursuit of their individual dreams may take all their energies with nothing left for their relationship. and any compromise each may make in getting ahead may change the person with whom each has fallen in love.",
      "in sun-kissed los angeles, a pair of morning commuters jammed on a wide stretch of highway are off to a rocky start. but suave sebastian, a charming jazz pianist whom life's got him on the ropes, and lovely mia, a brilliant playwright waiting for her big break, are meant for each other. on the one hand, sebastian thinks he has a serious plan for the future. on the other hand, mia squanders herself in meaningless auditions, mesmerised by old hollywood glamour. however, as the incurable romantics keep running into each other under the city's starry nights and plum-hued sunrises, a magical, old-school tap-dance romance timidly begins. such is the power of effervescent love: it inspires people to have long walks while gazing at the colourful milky way of the city's flickering lights. but life is as exciting as it is challenging. after all, no one knows what tomorrow holds. and as the young idealists veer from their dreams, questions arise. does true love exist only in movies? do dreams come true in real life?"

    "synopsis": "Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski, polar opposites, begin a volatile relationship that ends when Clementine erases Joel from her memory via Lacuna Inc. overnight while he sleeps. Joel, devastated, undergoes the same procedure to erase Clementine, hoping to forget. As the memory-erasure progresses, Joel experiences vivid remnants of their relationship in reverse-ordered memories, while Clementine’s subconscious implications hint at remorse. Joel fights the process, attempting to hide or preserve memories; technicians Stan and Patrick manipulate the brain-map of erased recollections, and receptionist Mary Svevo’s parallel entanglements with Howard Mierzwiak affect the operation. The procedure reveals their conflict, a beach rendezvous in Montauk, and the day they first met, gradually collapsing the memory-scrape. Joel’s waning memories pull him toward Clementine; he ultimately confronts the possibility that forgetting may not be the answer. Mary steals Lacuna records, exposing past affairs and memory manipulations. In the final sequence, Joel wakes with Clementine’s memory gone and later encounters her on a Montauk beach and again in Boston, where they reconnect with a renewed, albeit uncertain, chance at love, choosing to try again despite their erased histories.",

      "clementine entered joel's apartment at 3 am, she was drunk and had wrecked joel's car. joel calls clementine an alcoholic. clementine says that joel is only angry as she had fun without him, and now he wonders whether clementine had sex with anyone. clementine storms out when joel says that she uses sex to get people to like her.\nfew days ago, joel and clementine were at the flea market when clementine says that she wanted to have a baby, but joel said that they were not ready. they had a fight when joel said he didn't think clementine would make a good mother.\nafter this fight, joel barish (jim carrey) (a bookish introvert) discovers that his girlfriend clementine kruczynski (kate winslet) (a spontaneous extrovert) has had her memories of him erased by the new york city firm lacuna. it was 3 days before valentine's day and joel had gone to visit clementine at the bookstore where she worked (to give her a valentine's day present), and she had no memory of him, and was dating another guy.\njoel goes to his friends carrie eakin (jane adams) & rob eakin (david cross), and there he finds a card from lacuna inc stating that clementine has had the procedure to erase joel from her memories and that they should refrain joel from trying to contact her ever again. joel is distraught and frustrated to learn that clementine chooses to erase joel from her life. heartbroken, he decides to undergo the same procedure. joel visits lacuna and meets the doctor and owner howard (tom wilkinson) and fixes an appointment for the day before valentine. howard refuses to talk about clementine but says that she was deeply unhappy.\nin preparation, he records a tape for lacuna (and also collects everything associated to clementine in his life), recounting his memories of their volatile relationship. howard's technician stan (mark ruffalo) uses the objects associated to clementine to make a map of howard's memory in his brain. technically the procedure is brain damage, but howard says that it is on par with a night of heavy drinking. in flashback, it is shown that they had met on a day when joel was in montauk with his girlfriend naomi. naomi and joel were invited to a party on beach, but naomi could not go. the beach was freezing in february. clementine was chatty, while joel was shy and awkward. joel was attracted to the orange sweatshirt that clementine was wearing. she was vivacious and decided to spend the night in an empty house right on the beach. she invited joel in, but he left. later they meet in the city, and they start dating. the lacuna employees stan and patrick (who enter joel's apartment by stealth, while he is asleep) work on joel's brain as he sleeps in his apartment so that he will wake up with no memory of the procedure. when joel had got home that evening, he had received a package from lacuna, that gave him precise instructions to prepare for the procedure, including pjs to wear and a sleeping pill so that he doesn't wake up unexpectedly. so, joel knew that the technicians would be coming. stan and patrick make fun of joel and his feelings for clementine. one employee, patrick (elijah wood), leaves to see clementine; since her procedure, he has been using joel's and clementine's memories as a guide for seducing her.\npatrick fell in love with clementine on the night of her procedure and even stole her panties. he leaves joel's house in the middle of the procedure to meet clementine (whom he calls tangerine due to her hair color), when mary arrives to meet stan at joel's apartment. patrick gives joel's valentine gift to clementine as a gift from himself.\nmary, the receptionist for lacuna who, while dating stan fink, has a crush on howard mierzwiak.\nwhile the procedure runs on joel's brain, technician stan (mark ruffalo) and mary (kirsten dunst) party and have sex, right on the bed where joel is sleeping and having his memories erased. joel re-experiences his memories of clementine as they are erased, starting with their last fight. stan is not happy as he is not getting as clean a map as he would have liked. while stan and patrick argue, joel can hear their comments during his reliving of his own memories in his subconscious brain.\nas joe reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. his mental projection of clementine suggests that joel hid her in memories that do not involve her. this halts the procedure, but stan calls the lacuna boss, howard (tom wilkinson), who arrives and restarts it.\njoel comes to his last remaining memory of clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in montauk. as the memory crumbles around them, clementine tells joel to meet her in montauk. in joel's apartment, while stan is outside, mary tells howard she is in love with him, and they kiss. howard's wife hollis (deirdre o'connell) arrives, and, from the street, sees them through the window. furious, she tells howard to tell mary the truth: that mary and howard previously had an affair, and that mary had her memories erased. disgusted, mary steals the lacuna records and mails them to the patients, including joel and clementine. joel wakes up, his memories of clementine erased. he goes to montauk on impulse, by skipping work that day (it was valentine's day 2004). once again, the beach is freezing as it is february and joel makes an entry in his diary. joel sees clementine in her orange sweatshirt on the beach and then at a local diner but doesn't talk to her. he meets clementine again on the train home. they both have the feeling that they have met each other previously. they are drawn to each other. joel offers clementine a lift after they reach boston. they spend time at clementine's apartment before joel goes home, but he calls clementine right after he gets home. the same night, they go on a date to the frozen charles river in boston. joel drives clementine home and patrick sees them, realizing they have found each other again. joel and clementine receive their lacuna records and listen to their tapes. they are shocked by the bitter memories they had of each other but agree to try again."

      "much to his surprise, timid joel barish is shocked to discover that the love of his life, sparky clementine, has had him erased from her memory. as a result, hurt and angry, joel wants to pay her back in the same coin, going as far as to undergo a painless but intricate medical procedure to do the same. however, poor joel is utterly unaware that darkness is an essential part of the light. and as the once-cherished recollections of clementine gradually fade away, giving way to a soulless black void, something unexpected happens. now joel has second thoughts, toying with the idea of stopping the irreversible process. who said ignorance is bliss?",
      "joel barish and clementine kruczynski are polar opposites which is what may have attracted each to the other, but which may have also been the cause of whatever problems in their relationship. joel is introverted and controlled, while clementine, her hair always dyed a bright color, is extroverted, a slightly ditsy free spirit, and impulsive. it is that impulse that leads to clementine going to lacuna, inc., a company, run by dr. howard mierzwiak, that can erase people or other things from one's memory, she who had joel erased from hers as an aftermath of their breakup. in learning what clementine did in she not recognizing him in subsequent chance meetings, joel decides to undergo the procedure himself to rid his memory of her. technicians stan fink and patrick wertz are assigned to joel's case, the procedure done in one overnight period while the client is asleep to awaken with no knowledge of it having happened. during the procedure, joel's subconscious becomes aware of what is happening as clementine disappears in one memory after another. as such, he tries to stop the procedure as he changes his mind in still having feelings for her. unable to wake up during the procedure, he decides to try and \"hide\" figuratively and literally. in addition, clementine's subconscious, at least in his subconscious, implies that she too regrets having had joel erased from her memory. what happens with joel and clementine is affected by howard, stan, patrick and lacuna's receptionist mary svevo's holistic experiences with lacuna.",

      "joel is stunned to discover that his girlfriend clementine has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. out of desperation, he contracts the inventor of the process, dr. howard mierzwaik, to have clementine removed from his own memory. but as joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. from deep within the recesses of his brain, joel attempts to escape the procedure. as dr. mierzwiak and his crew chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that joel just can't get her out of his head."

    "synopsis": "Amélie, a shy Parisian waitress, grows up largely isolated after her father wrongly deems her delicate. She builds a vivid inner world and, as an adult in Montmartre, secretly helps others: returning a boyhood treasure to its owner, orchestrating small mischiefs, and nudging strangers toward happiness. When she discovers a hidden box of childhood memorabilia, she tracks down its owner, a reclusive man named Bretodeau, whose emotional rediscovery spurs him to reconnect with family. Amélie’s acts expand to her neighbors and coworkers: nudging her hypochondriac colleague Georgette toward love, matchmaking the flirtatious Lucien and his boss, and arranging playful schemes that give others moments of meaning. She steals letters, engineers fake notes, and stages clues to spark romance between Georgette’s friend and a café patron, while secretly steering a romance between herself and Nino Quincampoix after a year of cautious pursuit. As she guides others toward joy, Amélie confronts her own loneliness; a nameless inner clock ticks as she learns to take risks, seize love, and pursue a complete life rather than living through imagined acts of kindness alone. The story culminates when Nino surfaces with a note and their eyes meet; Amélie chooses to step forward, beginning a real relationship and continuing her mission to brighten the lives around her.",

      "amelie poulain (audrey tautou) is the only child & his dad never makes physical contact with his daughter except for a monthly medical checkup. when amelie is 6, he concludes that she has a serious heart defect when in reality, amelie's heartbeat faster due to nervousness from the contact. he declares amelie to be too delicate for school, and she is taught at home by her mother. amandine (lorella cravotta) is constantly stressed and anxious and breaks down over strange events such as amelie's goldfish leaping from its bowl. given no mental stimulation from her parents and isolated from other children, amelie develops an intricate imagination to entertain herself. she becomes fairly comfortable in her solitude, but her life is shaken when her mother is inadvertently killed by a suicidal tourist leaping from the roof of notre dame who lands on her. as a result, her father, raphael (rufus), withdraws more and more from society. amélie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the café des 2 moulins in montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. she is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking creme brulee with a spoon, and skipping stones along the canal saint-martin. residents of her apartment building include raymond dufayel (serge merlin): an elderly recluse artist with very brittle bones, madelene wells (yolande moreau): the sulking concierge who mourns the death of her cheating husband, colignion (urbain cancelier): the grouchy grocer, and lucien (jamel debbouze): colignion's clumsy employee. on august 31, 1997, the date of princess diana's death, amélie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box which contains childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. it contains pictures and toys from decades before. amelie decides to find the box's owner to return it, and if he is touched by the gesture, she will dedicate her life to such acts of kindness. after asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, amélie meets her reclusive neighbor, raymond dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who replicates pierre-auguste renoir's 1881 painting luncheon of the boating party every year. he recalls the boy's name as \"bretodeau\". amélie finds the man, dominique bretodeau (maurice benichou), and surreptitiously gives him the box. moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. amélie happily embarks on her new mission. amélie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. she escorts a blind man to the métro station while giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes.\namelie decides to encourage her father to travel for the first time. she steals his beloved garden gnome and gives it to her stewardess friend, who takes pictures of it in famous foreign locations at her flight stops. amelie anonymously sends the pictures to her father.\nshe starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker georgette (isabelle nanty) and joseph, a patron of the cafe. one day at the train station, amelie encounters nino quincampoix (matthieu kassovitz), an eccentric young man whose hobby is reconstructing torn-up pictures found underneath photo booths. nino drops one of his photo albums when chasing a mysterious man through the station, and amelie looks through it. the man nino was chasing appears in reconstructed photos throughout the album, and nino was intent on discovering his identity.\nshe sets up a series of clues for him that would eventually bring them together. in the meantime, amelie steals madame wells' letters from her husband (written to her decades before) and cleverly creates a new letter in which he apologizes to his wife for his infidelity. after receiving the false letter, madame wells is overjoyed with the news that her husband loved her after all. amelie also avenges lucien by playing practical jokes on colingion, whom she dislikes for constantly insulting lucien. mentally exhausted, collignon no longer abuses his meek, good-nature assistant lucien. a delighted lucien subsequently takes charge at the grocery stand. amelie had regular visits with raymond dufayel, who has been recreating the same renoir painting for 20 years. although he has copied the same renoir painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. they discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, amélie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image.\nhe reminds her that, despite her intentions to help others, she is neglecting her own pursuit for happiness. amelie resolves to meet nino once and for all and lures him to her cafe with a note. he arrives but she is too shy to address him, even when he gently confronts her with the note. while amelie is out of earshot, her fellow waitress gina (clotilde mollet) asks nino to talk with her in private, to ensure that amelie will not be hurt by him. after speaking with nino, gina sees that he is a good man. however, gina's ex-boyfriend joseph (dominique pinon) sees the two leave together and, after being dumped by georgette, reveals his (incorrect) observation that nino and gina are dating. amelie hears this and is crushed. at home, amelie weeps while frustratingly baking a cake. she daydreams of a life with nino, amid all the current characters in her life. she is startled when her doorbell rings. she hears nino speaking to her from the hallway, but she is too nervous to answer. assuming she is not home, nino slips a note under her door, assuring her that he will return. a conflicted amelie finds a personal videotape from mr. dufayel, in which he encourages her to pursue the man she loves, or risk eternal unhappiness. amelie rushes to the door just as nino returns. she brings him in without speaking, and after finally seeing each other under new circumstances, they begin a relationship. sometime later, amelie and nino are still happy together."

A large stick insect appears, leads Ofelia to an ancient labyrinth where a faun declares her the reincarnated princess Moanna. She must complete three tasks to prove royalty and gain immortality. First task: retrieve a key from the belly of a giant toad. Second task: retrieve a dagger from the Pale Man’s lair, aided by a magic chalk that opens doors; disobeys warning by eating grapes, awakening the Pale Man and losing fairy allies. Third task: return with the infant to the labyrinth, but the faun demands blood. Ofelia refuses to harm her newborn brother. Vidal intensifies the hunt for rebels; Carmen dies in childbirth; Mercedes, secretly aiding the rebels, is captured but escapes, stabbing Vidal not fatally. In the climactic pursuit, Ofelia retrieves the baby and enters the labyrinth; the faun allows blood sacrifice of innocence, but Ofelia sacrifices herself by choosing her own fate, dying in Mercedes’ arms. In the underworld, her immortal reign is affirmed as she sits on a throne with her mother and the king, while the epilogue notes Moanna’s long-ago rule and traces of her time in the human world.\n",

      "in a fairy tale, princess moanna (ivana baquero), whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. she becomes mortal and eventually dies. the king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths, which act as portals, around the world in preparation for her return. in 1944 francoist spain, ten-year-old ofelia (ivana baquero) travels with her pregnant but sickly mother carmen (ariadna gil) to meet captain vidal (sergi lópez), her new stepfather. vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in morocco, believes strongly in falangism and has been assigned to hunt down republican rebels. a large stick insect, which ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by vidal's housekeeper mercedes (maribel verdú), who is secretly supporting her brother pedro (roger casamajor) and other rebels. mercedes has access to vidal's strategy against the rebels and passes crucial info to them, which allows the rebels to stay one step ahead of vidal's plans to hunt them down. that night, the insect appears in ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. there, she meets a faun (doug jones), who believes she is the reincarnation of princess moanna. he gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality (and to ensure that her essence is intact and that she has not yet become a mortal in spirit as well) and return to her kingdom. ofelia completes the first task - retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad - but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. the faun gives ofelia a mandrake root, instructing her to keep it under carmen's bed in a bowl of milk and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease carmen's illness. accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk (which allows her to create a door anywhere she wishes), ofelia then completes the second task - retrieving a dagger (she uses the key from the previous task to open a vault that contains the dagger) from the lair of the pale man (doug jones), a child-eating monster. although warned not to consume anything (from the massive feast laid out) there, she eats two grapes, awakening the pale man. he devours two of the fairies and chases ofelia, but she manages to escape. infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give ofelia the third task. during this time, ofelia becomes aware of vidal's ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the rebels. after he murders two local farmers detained on false suspicion of aiding the rebels, vidal interrogates and tortures a captive rebel. he asks doctor ferreiro (álex angulo) to tend to the captive, whom ferreiro then euthanize at the rebel's own urging. realizing that ferreiro is a rebel collaborator, vidal kills him. vidal later catches ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which he considers delusional. carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. she immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to vidal's son. mercedes, having been discovered to be a spy, tries to escape with ofelia, but they are caught. ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while mercedes is taken to be interrogated and tortured. mercedes frees herself, and stabs vidal non-lethally in her escape to re-join the rebels. the faun, having changed his mind about giving ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. ofelia successfully retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. vidal pursues her as the rebels launch an attack on the outpost. ofelia meets the faun at the center of the labyrinth. the faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but ofelia refuses to harm her brother. vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. the faun leaves, and vidal takes the baby from ofelia's arms before shooting her. vidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is surrounded by rebels, including mercedes and pedro. knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to mercedes, asking that his son be told about him. mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name. pedro then shoots vidal dead. mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts motionless, dying ofelia. drops of ofelia's blood fall down the center of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. the king of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. the faun praises ofelia for her choice, addressing her once more as \"your highness\". the queen of the underworld, her mother, invites ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. back in the stone labyrinth, ofelia smiles as she dies in mercedes' arms.\nthe epilogue completes the tale of princess moanna, stating that she returned to the underworld, ruled wisely for many centuries, and left quiet traces of her time in the human realm \"visible only to those who know where to look.\""

Juan and Teresa provide rare stability; Chiron learns to endure taunts about being soft and questions his sexuality. As a teen, peer harassment escalates; Chiron accepts a self-protective tough persona, but a bond with his friend Kevin culminates in a kiss and a sexual encounter that is interrupted by Terrel’s hazing, leaving Chiron beaten and betrayed; a social worker advises reporting the abuse, which he rejects, and he retaliates at Terrel. Now an adult, Chiron lives in Atlanta as Black, dealing drugs; a call from Kevin reconnects in Miami, and he finally forgives his mother as Paula seeks treatment. A late reunion with Kevin reveals lingering silence about intimacy, but memory of the moonlit beach and his former nickname anchors his sense of self as he reconciles love, identity, and origin.",

from a pack of bullies. chiron is very skeptical to trust juan at first, but juan is friendly and not very pushy, and invites chiron for a meal. chiron is shy, reticent and quiet.\njuan allows chiron to spend the night with him and his girlfriend teresa (janelle monáe) before returning him to his emotionally abusive mother paula (naomie harris) the next day. teresa is warm and inviting towards chiron and knows that juan can be an intimidating personality. juan is a drugs supplier and has his network of dealers that work the streets. business is good for juan.\njuan tells paula that chiron didn't tell him where he lived till the following morning and hence, he did not bring him home the previous night. kevin is chiron's only real friend as a kid. kevin tells chiron to stand up for himself and to not allow others to see that he is soft.\nchiron continues to spend time with juan, who teaches him how to swim and advises him to make his own path. juan sees chiron as a little boy standing on the beach in moonlight. an old lady once told juan that african american boys look blue in moonlight. one night, juan observes paula smoking crack with one of his customers near the location where the dealer sold the drugs to the customer. juan berates her for her addiction while paula rebukes him for selling crack in the first place. she implies that she knows why chiron gets tormented by his peers, alluding to \"the way he walks\" before going home and taking out her frustration on chiron. and she calls him a \"fa**ot\". the next day, chiron admits to juan and teresa that he hates his mother and asks what a \"fa**ot\" is. juan tells him it is \"a word used to make gay people feel bad.\" he tells chiron there is nothing wrong with being gay and that he should not allow others to mock him. juan and teresa assure him that when it is time, chiron would know whether he is gay or not.\nchiron then asks juan whether he sells drugs and whether his mother does drugs. after juan remorsefully answers yes to both questions, chiron leaves as juan hangs his head in shame. ii. chiron now a teenager, chiron (ashton sanders) juggles avoiding his classmate terrel (patrick

frequently coercing chiron into giving her money that teresa loans him. paula tells chiron that teresa is not his mother, and that chiron has to support paula as she is his blood relative. chiron can see that paula is simply exploiting his relationship with teresa to score some cash. one night, chiron has a dream in which his closest friend kevin (jharrel jerome) has sex with a woman. chiron tries to avoid going home after school and spends his time wherever he can (public transport, stations, the streets etc).\non another night, kevin visits chiron at the beach near his house. while smoking a blunt, the two discuss their respective ambitions and the nickname, \"black\", that kevin has given chiron. after a charged moment, they kiss, and kevin masturbates chiron. the next morning, terrel pressures kevin into participating in a hazing ritual against the gays at school. terrel chooses chiron as the victim and tells kevin to punch him up. kevin starts punching chiron, who is defiant and keeps getting back up.\nkevin reluctantly punches chiron until he is unable to get up before terrel and several others stomp on him, leaving him seriously hurt. chiron feels betrayed by kevin and feels let down as kevin himself is gay.\nchiron later meets with a social worker, who urges him to reveal the identities of his attackers. he refuses, however, as he believes that reporting them will not solve anything. the next day, chiron smashes a chair into terrel's back. as the police arrest chiron, he glares at a helpless kevin. iii. black now going by the name \"black\" (trevante rhodes), an adult chiron deals drugs in atlanta. he receives frequent calls from paula, who asks him to visit her at the drug treatment center where she now lives. one night, he receives a call from kevin (andre holland), who apologizes for his behavior while in high school and invites chiron to visit him in miami.\nthe next day, he wakes up after dreaming about kevin to find that he has had a wet dream. while visiting his mother at the drug treatment center, chiron admits that he feels remorse for his lack of empathy towards her. paula eventually apologizes for having been a bad mother and not supporting him when he needed her, and he forgives her. he then travels to miami and reunites with kevin, who now works in a diner, but chiron is reluctant to speak or drink with kevin. kevin confesses that he is surprised by chiron's new appearance, occupation, and motivation for seeing him. after dinner, the two drive to kevin's home. kevin tells chiron that, although his life may not have turned out the way he hoped, he is still happy. chiron admits he has never been intimated with another person since their encounter on the beach. as kevin comforts him, chiron remembers himself as little, standing on a beach in the moonlight."

      "three time periods - young adolescence, mid-teen and young adult - in the life of black-american chiron is presented. when a child, chiron lives with his single, crack addict mother paula in a crime ridden neighborhood in miami. chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. because of these issues, chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. besides his same aged cuban-american friend kevin, chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named juan, who can see that he is neglected, and juan's caring girlfriend teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from paula's abuse. with this childhood as a foundation, chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself.",
      "1980s miami. labelled as \"soft\" for his walk, sensitive 9-year-old boy chiron is an easy target. and in a cruel world of antitheses, where everything can change at the sight of a knife or a gun, society has doomed chiron to live a hard life. but violence begets violence. then, months turn into years, and the boy grows into an introverted 16-year-old teenager struggling with his identity. now, only a tough facade can shield him from the world. as a result, three pivotal periods--marked by intimidation, neglect, and pale paternal figures--define chiron, now a vulnerable young adult. but, after all these years, complex pent-up emotions still get in the way of self-discovery. however, chiron wants to know. in his desperate journey to evolution, will he ever accept himself?",
      "the film chronicles the life of chiron, a young black man growing up in a rough miami neighborhood, through three pivotal stages of his life. it explores his struggle with identity, masculinity, and love, as he navigates family challenges, societal pressures, and personal discovery. the story highlights the impact of environment and relationships on personal growth."

    "synopsis": "First-person writer recalls the Grand Budapest Hotel's glory days. Young zero moustafa, a junior lobby boy, partners with concierge gustave to serve guests and court wealthy patrons. Gustave receives a valuable painting, Boy with Apple, from madame d; her son dmitri contests the will. Gustave and zero steal the painting, flee the hotel with it, and Gustave is later framed for murder. Zero helps Gustave escape prison, aided by agatha, his fiancée. They embark on a pursuit across Zubrowka, confronting jet-set assassins and a mounting war. They retrieve the painting from a mountaintop monastery, uncover a second will, and expose that gustave was innocent. The will leaves the fortune, hotel, and painting to Gustave, elevating his status; zero inherits the wealth after Gustave’s presumed death during a train crossing. The hotel declines with time and war, while zero preserves its memory. In the present, a teenage writer reads the memoir; the tale of gustave and zero remains a legacy amidst fading grandeur.",

      "in the present, a teenage girl approaches a monument to a writer in a cemetery. in her arms is a memoir penned by a character known only as \"the author\". she begins reading a chapter about a trip he made to the grand budapest hotel in 1968.\nlocated in the fictional republic of zubrowka, a european alpine state ravaged by war and poverty, the author discovers that the remote, mountainside hotel has fallen on hard times. many of its lustrous facilities are now in a poor state of repair, and its guests are few. the author encounters the hotel's elderly owner, zero moustafa (tony revolori), one afternoon, and they agree to meet later that evening. over dinner in the hotel's enormous dining room, zero tells him the tale of how he took ownership of the hotel and why he is unwilling to close it down. the owner's story begins in 1932, during the hotel's glory days, when he worked as a lobby boy. zubrowka is on the verge of war, but this is of little concern to gustave (ralph fiennes), the grand budapest's devoted concierge. when he is not attending to the needs of the hotel's wealthy clientele or managing its staff, gustave courts a series of aging women who flock to the hotel to enjoy his \"exceptional service\". one of the ladies is madame céline villeneuve \"madame d\" desgoffe und taxis, and gustave spends the night with her prior to her departure. one month later, he is informed that madame d has died under mysterious circumstances. taking zero along, he races to her wake and the reading of the will, where he learns that she bequeathed him boy with apple, a very valuable painting, in her will. this enrages her family, all of whom hoped to inherit it. her son, dmitri desgoffe und taxis (adrien brody), lashes out at gustave. with the help of zero, gustave takes the painting and returns to the grand budapest, securing the painting in the hotel's safe. during the journey, gustave makes a pact with zero - in return for the latter's help, he makes zero his heir. shortly thereafter, gustave is arrested and imprisoned for the murder of madame d after forced testimony by serge x, madame d's butler, which basically says that serge saw gustave at the night of the crime near madame x's chambers. serge is a good friend of gustave & he is unwilling to believe the story. gustave has an alibi, in another rich old woman, but cant use her to prove his innocence as she is married to someone presently. zero aids gustave in escaping from zubrowka's prison by sending a series of stone-working tools concealed inside cakes made by zero's fiance agatha. along with a group of hardened convicts, gustave digs his way out of his cell. gustave teams up with zero to prove his innocence. after gustave's escape, dmitri realizes that the painting has been stolen & asks jopling to trace them down.\ntheir adventure takes them to a mountaintop monastery where they meet with serge x, the only person who can clear gustave of the murder accusations. they are pursued by j.g. jopling (willem dafoe), a cold-blooded assassin working for dmitri, who kills serge. jopling also killed the attorney executing madame x's will as he suspected a crucial document was missing which could alter the allocation of the entire estate and not just the painting (boy with apple). dmitri was angry with the attorney and got jopling to silence him forever. zero and gustave steal a sled and chase jopling as he flees the monastery on skis. during a face-off at the edge of a cliff, zero pushes the assassin to his death and rescues his mentor. back at the grand budapest, the outbreak of war is imminent and the military have commandeered the hotel and are in the process of converting it into a barracks. a heartbroken gustave vows to never again pass the threshold. they are joined by agatha, who agrees to go inside and retrieve the painting but is discovered by dmitri. a chase and a chaotic gunfight ensue before gustave's innocence is finally proved by discovery of the copy of madame d's second will which she gave to serge and he subsequently hid in the back of the painting. this will was to take effect if she was murdered. the movie does not make it clear who actually killed madame d (although there is, earlier in the film, a suggestive shot of a bottle labeled \"strychnine\" on jopling's desk) or exactly how gustave is proved innocent. the will also reveals that she was the mysterious owner of the grand budapest. she leaves much of her fortune, the hotel, and the painting to gustave, making him fabulously wealthy in the process. he becomes one of the hotel's regular guests. during a train journey across the border, enemy soldiers inspect gustave and zero's papers. narrating the story, zero describes gustave being taken out and shot after defending zero, as he did on the initial train ride in the beginning of the movie. agatha succumbs to \"the prussian grippe\" and dies two years later, as does her infant son. zero inherits the fortune gustave leaves behind and vows to continue his legacy at the grand budapest, but a communist takeover of zubrowka and the ravages of time slowly begin to take their toll on both the building and its owner. an aged and devastated zero confesses to the author that he cannot bring himself to close the hotel because it is his last link to the best years of his life. the author later departs for south america and never returns to the hotel.\nback in the present, the girl continues reading in front of the statue of the author."

    "overview": "in the slums of rio, two kids' paths diverge as one struggles to become a photographer and the other a kingpin.",
    "synopsis": "In Cidade de Deus a housing project in Rio, a boy narrator Rocket grows up amid escalating gang violence. The early years follow the Tender Trio—Shaggy, Clipper, Goose—who rob and loot; a fatal motel heist by Li’l Dice triggers police scrutiny and splits the group. Li’l Dice becomes Li’l Zé, and Benny partners with him; Zé builds a drug empire by eliminating rivals while keeping the peace with fear. Rocket, aspiring photographer, documents the rise, watching friends turn to power and crime; he avoids active violence, yet is repeatedly drawn back to the streets. By the 1970s and 1980s, Zé’s reign faces a challenge from Carrot’s faction and the Runts, sparking open war over territory and drug trade. Benny leaves for Angelica, is killed, and Zé’s power accelerates through brutal paydays, rape, killings, and a shifting alliance web. As police corruption and violence intensify, Rocket gains access to pivotal scenes through photos—first of Zé’s notoriety, then of his death. In the final act, Zé is captured and then murdered by the Runts; Rocket weighs publishing stark images of cops or Zé’s corpse, chooses the latter for career leverage, and the Runts establish a new hit list to seize control of the favela’s drug economy. The film closes with the Runts wandering Cidade de Deus, setting out to eliminate remaining dealers and rewrite the power balance.",

      "chickens are being prepared for a meal. a chicken escapes, and an armed gang chases after it in a favela called the cidade de deus (\"city of god\"). the chicken stops between the gang and a young man named rocket (alexandre rodrigues), who believes the gang wants to kill him. a flashback traces rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s. in the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the center of rio de janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the \"tender trio\" - shaggy (jonathan haagensen), clipper (jefechander suplino), and goose (renato de souza) - rob and loot business owners; goose is rocket's brother. the thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the city and are protected by them in return. several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, li'l dice (douglas silva), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. the gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells li'l dice to serve as lookout. they give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive, but an unsatisfied li'l dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off. the massacre brings police attention, forcing the trio to split up: clipper joins the church, shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the favela, and goose is shot by li'l dice after taking the thieving boy's money while li'l dice's friend benny (phellipe haagensen) watches. the story of the tender trio comes to an end. li'l dice escapes the favela and works petty crimes with benny to keep the money flowing. but one day, he realizes that the real bucks are in drugs, and the major trade in the favela is owned by carrot and his dealers, including blackie. some years later in the 1970s, the favela has transformed into an urban jungle. rocket has joined a group of young hippies. he enjoys photography and likes one girl, angelica (alice braga), but his attempts to get close to her are ruined by a gang of petty criminal kids known as \"the runts\". li'l dice now calls himself \"li'l zé\" (leandro firmino da hora), and along with benny he has established a drug empire by eliminating all of the competition, except for one dealer named carrot (matheus nachtergaele), and forcing carrot's manager blackie (neguinho) to work for him instead. a relative peace has come over the city of god under the reign of li'l zé, who avoids police attention by having an initiate kill a runt. zé plans to kill carrot, but benny talks him out of it. ze' believes that carrot is protecting the runts in his section. runts do hold ups in the favela and that brings the police, which is bad for business all around. carrot tells ze' to mind his own business. ze' decides to take on the runts himself and shoots one of them. rocket takes a job at the supermarket.\nbenny, who is now involved with angelica, decides to leave the city. during the farewell party, zé is distracted, and blackie accidentally kills benny while trying to shoot li'l zé. as benny was the only man holding zé back from taking over carrot's business, his death leaves zé unchecked, and carrot kills blackie for endangering his life. following benny's death, zé beats up a peaceful man named knockout ned (seu jorge) and rapes ned's girlfriend (just because one day ze' laid his eyes on ned's girl, who refused to return his affections). after ned's brother stabs zé, his gang retaliates by killing his brother and firing on ned's house and killing his uncle. ned, looking for revenge, sides with carrot, and a war breaks out between carrot and zé. in the early 1980s, both sides enlist more \"soldiers\". zé provides weapons for the runts, and eventually the reason for the war is forgotten. one day, zé has rocket take photos of him and his gang. after rocket leaves his film with a friend who works at a newspaper office downtown, a female reporter publishes one of the prints, a major scoop since nobody can get into the city of god anymore. rocket believes his life is endangered, as he thinks ze will kill him if he returns to the favela; the reporter takes him in for the night, and he loses his virginity to her. rocket agrees to continue taking photographs, not realizing zé is very pleased with increased notoriety. rocket returns to the city for more photographs, bringing the film back to the opening scene. confronted by the gang, rocket is surprised that zé asks him to take pictures, but as he prepares to take the photo, the police arrive, and then drive off when carrot arrives. in the gunfight, ned is killed by a boy who has infiltrated his gang to avenge his father: a security guard who was killed by ned during a bank robbery. the police capture li'l zé and carrot, planning to give the media carrot, whose gang never paid off the police, while they steal zé's money and let him go. rocket secretly photographs the scene. zé is murdered by the runts who intend to run the criminal enterprise themselves. rocket photographs zé's dead body and brings both pictures back to the newspaper. rocket contemplates whether to publish the photo of the cops, exposing corruption and becoming famous, or the photo of li'l zé's body, which will get him an internship at the newspaper. he decides on the latter and the film ends with the runts walking around the city of god, making a hit list of the dealers they plan to kill to take over the drug business, including the red brigade."

      "during their childhood, several children raised in one of the violent neighborhoods of rio de janeiro see galling and nettlesome behaviors that turn some into criminals and some into poltroons; while one photographer boy in the middle stays out of their informal war until it's finished and then narrates the complicated story of what happened in that neighborhood and the ascending process of crime between men who were once innocent children.",
      "set in a notorious slum of rio - cidade de deus / city of god - the story of a boy who sees his friends and brother grow up or aspire to be gangsters, and decides to do something else. meanwhile we also see the power struggles in the neighbourhood, how they developed, who the main protagonists are and the state of their feud.",
      "in rio de janeiro's favelas, young rocket grows up amidst escalating gang violence and crime. the narrative follows multiple characters over decades, highlighting cycles of power, poverty, and moral compromise. the film blends crime, social realism, and drama, exploring ambition, survival, ethical ambiguity, and the human impact of systemic violence and societal neglect."

Fletcher selects Andrew for his studio band as alternate core drummer, then repeatedly blurs lines between rigorous coaching and abusive harassment: belittling, throwing objects, and brutal tempo demands. Andrew endures grueling rehearsals, a brutal audition under extreme tempo, and public shaming, all while pursuing a dream of surpassing legends like Buddy Rich. A pivotal test at a local jazz competition and a grueling caravan performance push Andrew to the edge; a car crash, injuries, and a dramatic on-stage confrontation culminate in Andrew’s expulsion and a legal confrontation that leads to Fletcher’s firing. Months later, Fletcher reappears, testing Andrew again; during a festival performance, Andrew confronts Fletcher, reclaims the stage with a blistering drum solo, and earns a final, hard-won nod from Fletcher as he proves his readiness to endure and risk everything for greatness.",

      "andrew neiman (miles teller) is a first-year jazz student at the prestigious shaffer conservatory in new york. he has been playing drums from a young age and aspires to become one of the greats like buddy rich.\nconductor terence fletcher (j. k. simmons) watches andrew practice his drums and walks out without saying anything. mr kramer (damon gupton) is andrew's first instructor at school, but it is clear that fletcher is the one that everybody wants to join.\nandrew has father jim (paul reiser), who is a writer turned high school teacher. andrew meets nicole, a movie theater employee and they begin dating. frank (chris mulkey) is andrew's uncle. the next day, andrew enters one class aside from fletcher and there, he meets the drummer named ryan connelly (austin stowell). shortly, the professor arrives, and the class performs \"billy's an\". andrew sees fletcher in silhouette looking at the door. after the class, andrew peeks into one of the classrooms where the class is handled by fletcher, and he is being looked at by fletcher. back at the studio band, andrew is playing drums as core drummer. suddenly, fletcher breaks inside and andrew becomes horrified of him. fletcher conducts every saxophonist and bassist one by one and finally the drums. fletcher eventually accepts andrew into his studio band as the alternate for core drummer carl tanner (nate lang). after that, fletcher tells andrew to come, and he is told to come at his room tomorrow at 6 in the morning. andrew invites nicole to go out with him. the next day, andrew realizes that he is late for class. andrew struggles and rushes quickly to the school, only he goes inside the empty classroom. andrew knows that the class actually starts at 9 am. andrew waits three hours before the class. andrew discovers that fletcher, although encouraging at first, is relentlessly strict and verbally and physically abusive towards his students, mocking and insulting them. fletcher confronts then suddenly yells at a saxophonist named metz (c.j. vana) playing out-of-tune and angrily tells him to get out of the studio band.\nwhen the band rehearses the hank levy piece \"whiplash\" and andrew struggles to keep his tempo, fletcher hurls a chair at him, slaps andrew every four in 12 counts he makes, and he will not stop questioning until andrew answers whether he is \"dragging\" or \"rushing\". andrew answers \"rushing\" then fletcher forces andrew to tell the whole band that he is really upset, louder! fletcher then mocks andrew about his parents being separated. thus, andrew is being embarrassed and insulted. at a local jazz competition, andrew misplaces carl's sheet music; as carl cannot play without it, andrew steps in informing fletcher that he can perform \"whiplash\" from memory. fletcher promotes him to core drummer.\nat the studio band, the band is practicing the new song called \"caravan\" which needs an extreme time stamp measure of 330 bpm. fletcher dismisses the band except andrew when fletcher discusses him about that note. shortly, ryan connelly, whom andrew met from the other class, arrives. andrew plays the drums to test the ability of the tempo, but his tempo fails while ryan plays well. therefore, fletcher takes ryan as the new core drummer, but andrew does not agree to this. jealous, andrew will be the core drummer if he earns the part. determined to impress fletcher, andrew practices until his hands bleed and breaks up with his girlfriend nicole (melissa benoist), believing she will distract him. the next day, fletcher tearfully reveals in class that a talented former student of his, sean casey, has died in a car accident. the band rehearses \"caravan\", but ryan struggles with the tempo. fletcher auditions andrew, ryan and carl for hours while the class waits outside. fletcher then pushes the three drummers to play at a faster tempo on \"caravan\", keeping them for a grueling five-hour practice. when it is andrew's turn, fletcher kicks the chair then throws the drum away in wrath and even tells andrew to increase the tempo. in this process, andrew's left hand is bleeding and the blood drips onto the drum set. after a one minute of playing, fletcher finally tells andrew that he earned the part. on the way to a jazz competition, andrew's bus breaks down. determined to make the performance, he rents a car but arrives late without his drumsticks. after an argument with fletcher, andrew drives back to the car rental office and retrieves the drumsticks. as he speeds back, his car is hit by a truck. he crawls from the wreckage and arrives on stage badly injured. when he struggles to play \"caravan\" due to his injuries, fletcher stops the band midway through the performance to tell andrew that he is \"done\". enraged, andrew attacks fletcher in front of the audience and is dragged away. days later, andrew is expelled from shaffer and meets with a lawyer representing the parents of sean casey. the lawyer explains that sean actually hanged himself, having suffered anxiety and depression after joining fletcher's class. sean's parents want to prevent fletcher from teaching. andrew agrees to testify, resulting in fletcher being fired. months later, andrew sees fletcher performing at a club. they drink together and fletcher explains that he pushes his students beyond the expected so they might achieve greatness. citing a story where jo jones allegedly threw a cymbal at charlie parker as an example, fletcher says that the next jazz musician to live up to parker's legacy would never let discouragement stop them. he invites andrew to perform at a festival concert with his band. andrew agrees and invites nicole, but she is in a new relationship and declines. on stage at the jazz festival, fletcher reveals to andrew that he knows he testified against him. in revenge, fletcher leads the band in a new piece for which andrew was not given sheet music. andrew leaves the stage humiliated, but returns and begins \"caravan\", interrupting fletcher as he addresses the audience. the rest of the band joins him, surprising fletcher, who eventually follows suit. andrew ends the performance with an extravagant drum solo, and fletcher gives him a nod of approval."

      "nineteen-year-old andrew niemann wants to be the greatest jazz drummer in the world, in a league with buddy rich . this goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with jim, his high-school-teacher father, being a failed writer. andrew is starting his first year at shaffer conservatory of music, the best music school in the united states. at shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under terence fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. based on their less than positive first meeting, andrew is surprised that fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. andrew quickly learns that fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. being the best in fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. his modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. regardless, andrew works hard to be the best. he has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. the other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by fletcher.",

      "andrew is a drummer and a first year student at the schaffer conservatory. he is selected by the school's senior instructor, mr. fletcher, to play on his studio band. fletcher is - to say the least - a difficult and demanding task master who accepts and expects nothing less that perfection from his students. his methods of exacting the best from his students include belittling them, throwing objects at them and creating a level of tension so high that average individuals would likely crumble under the pressure. it leads andrew to eventually quit but a surprise encounter with fletcher gives him a chance to show just what he can accomplish - or to fail miserably.",
      "with dreams of becoming one of the best jazz drummers in the world, andrew neiman enrolls himself into a prestigious music conservatory. his ambition does not go unnoticed, and he is hand-picked, and mentored by the schools senior instructor, fletcher. andrew soon realises that fletcher's terrifying methods will either make, or break him as an artist."

    "synopsis": "FBI trainee Clarice Starling is tasked by Jack Crawford to interrogate imprisoned psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter, seeking insights to profile Buffalo Bill, a killer who skins his female victims. Starling travels to Baltimore State Hospital, where Lecter’s cryptic clues trigger a psychological cat-and-mouse game; Lecter demands personal disclosures in exchange for actionable information. A severed head is found at a storage lot, linking to Buffalo Bill, and Catherine Martin, daughter of Senator Martin, is abducted. The investigation moves to West Virginia as Starling helps connect Bill’s skin-mutilation with a chrysalis artifact; Lecter’s profile guidance escalates the danger. Lecter manipulates events via a sham prison-transfer deal, while Dr. Chilton plots credit for solving the case. Lecter reveals Bill’s identity and past address to Senator Martin’s entourage, then escapes after a confrontation with Starling that forces her to recount a traumatic memory. Lecter’s escape triggers a nationwide manhunt; Starling decodes Bill’s signature as a “woman-skin” tailor, identifying Jame Gumb as the killer. A climactic basement pursuit in Calumet City ends with Starling saving Catherine and Gumb’s death. Lecter, now in the Bahamas, taunts Starling with a final chilling line as he departs, having framed himself as a dark mentor and omnipotent observer of her quest for justice.",

      "promising fbi academy student clarice starling is pulled from her training at the fbi training facility at quantico, virginia by jack crawford of the fbi's behavioral science unit, who tasks her with presenting a vicap questionnaire to the notorious dr. hannibal lecter, a brilliant forensic psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial murderer. after learning the assignment relates to the pursuit of vicious serial killer buffalo bill, starling travels to the baltimore state hospital for the criminally insane and is led by dr. frederick chilton to hannibal lecter, a sophisticated, cultured man restrained behind thick glass panels and windowless stone walls. although initially pleasant and courteous, lecter grows impatient with starling's attempts at \"dissecting\" him and viciously rebuffs her. as starling departs, another patient flings fresh semen onto her face, enraging lecter who calls starling back and offers a riddle containing information about a former patient. the solved riddle leads to a rent-a-storage lot where the severed head of benjamin raspail is found. starling returns to lecter, who links raspail to buffalo bill and who offers to help profile buffalo bill if he is transferred to a facility far from the venomous, careerist dr. chilton. hours and miles away, buffalo bill abducts catherine martin, the daughter of united states senator ruth martin. starling is pulled from quantico and accompanies crawford to west virginia, where the body of bill's most recently-discovered victim resides. in the plane taking them to the town, crawford asks starling what she sees in the file on buffalo bill. she says that bill is a male, definitely white and that he's getting better at his work since he's \"developed a taste for it\". at the coroner's office, starling helps perform the autopsy and extracts the chrysalis of a death's-head hawkmoth from the victim's throat. when the victim is turned over for further examination, they find that two large, diamond-shaped strips of flesh have been flayed from her body. having already spoken to lecter about how bill flays his victims, this detail is recorded by starling. at quantico, as news of catherine martin's abduction sweeps the country, crawford authorizes starling to offer hannibal lecter a fake deal promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps profile buffalo bill and rescue catherine martin. instead, lecter begins a game of \"quid pro quo\" with starling, offering comprehensive clues and insights about buffalo bill in exchange for events from starling's traumatic childhood. unaware to both starling and lecter, dr. frederick chilton tapes the conversation and after revealing starling's deal as a sham, offers to transfer lecter in exchange for a deal of his own making, one that will make chilton out as a hero for identifying and tracking down buffalo bill. lecter agrees and following a flight to tennessee reveals buffalo bill's real name, physical description and past address to senator martin and her entourage of fbi agents and justice department officials. he also insults martin openly, asking about her breastfeeding of her daughter. martin orders lecter back to baltimore when he spills buffalo bill's identity information. as the manhunt begins, starling travels to lecter's special cell in a local tennessee courthouse, where she confronts him about the false information he gave the senator. lecter refuses starling's pleas and demands she finish her story surrounding her worst childhood memory. after recounting her arrival at a relative's farm, the horror of discovering their lamb slaughterhouse and her fruitless attempts at rescuing the lambs -- they screamed as they were being slaughtered, a memory that has haunted starling her whole life -- lecter rebuffs her, leaving her with her case file before she is escorted out of the building by security guards. as she reaches for the file, he touches one of her fingers. later that evening, lecter escapes from his cell, his two minders distracted by having to move his sketches and tricking them into approaching him too closely. the local police storm the floor, discovering one guard barely alive and the other disemboweled and strung up on the bars of lecter's cage like an angel. paramedics transport the survivor to an ambulance and speed off while a swat team searches the building for lecter. as the team discover a body on top of the elevator car, the survivor in the ambulance peels off his own face, revealing lecter in disguise, who kills the paramedics and escapes to the airport. after being notified of lecter's escape, starling pores over her case file, analyzing lecter's annotations before realizing that the first victim, frederica bimmel, knew bill in real life before he killed her. starling travels to bimmel's hometown and discovers that bimmel was a tailor and has dresses with templates identical to the patches of skin removed from buffalo bill's victims. realizing that buffalo bill is a tailor fashioning a \"woman suit\" of real skin, she telephones crawford, who is already on the way to make an arrest, having cross-referenced lecter's notes with johns hopkins hospital and finding a man named jame gumb. crawford instructs starling to continue interviewing bimmel's friends while he leads a swat team to gumb's business address in calumet city, illinois. starling's interviews lead to the house of \"jack gordon,\" whom starling soon realizes is actually gumb, and draws her weapon just as gumb disappears into his basement. starling pursues him in the basement, which consists of several rooms, discovering a screaming catherine martin in the dry well. the lights in the basement suddenly go out, leaving her in complete darkness. gumb stalks starling in the dark with night vision goggles and prepares to shoot her when starling, hearing the clicks of his drawing back the hammer on his revolver, swivels around and shoots gumb dead. days later at the fbi academy graduation party, starling receives a phone call from hannibal lecter, now in the bahamas. as lecter assures starling he has no plans to pursue her, he excuses himself from the phone call, remarking that he's \"having an old friend for dinner\" before hanging up and following dr chilton through the streets of the village."

He travels west to cure the curse and encounters iron town, led by Lady Eboshi, which wounds the forest and hunts its spirits. In the forest, he meets San, a girl raised by wolves who fights to protect the woods. He witnesses Ikon the forest’s gods clashing with humans who mine iron and burn trees. San and Eboshi clash—San seeks forest mercy; Eboshi pushes weapons and military expansion. Ashitaka’s arc centers on choosing sides and urging coexistence while his curse intensifies and spreads. Eboshi’s gunlines attack the forest’s guardian gods; San rides wolves to defend the forest; Moro the wolf goddess and Okoto the boar lord transform into demons, fueled by human violence. Meanwhile Jigo plots to obtain the forest spirit’s head for imperial immortality, allying with Eboshi. The forest spirit, a luminous deer-giant, is wounded by Eboshi’s gunfire and becomes the Night Walker; it heals Ashitaka’s wound but dies at dawn after a final stand against human greed. In the final battles, Asitaka, San, and the wolves strive to protect both people and forest. Ashitaka and San acknowledge a fragile possibility of coexistence: he will stay to help rebuild Tatara, and she will continue to guard the forest, while humans learn to live with nature. A new dawn rises as trees sprout, scorched towns recover, and Kodama reappear as signs of renewal.",

      "the tale of princess mononoke is a fantasy adventure: an epic struggle between humanity and nature. the story's competing interests-- comprised of cursed monsters, an assortment of people driven by ambition, a selfless hero, and vengeful gods--are remarkable in that there is no villain, instead portraying darkness and hate as it manifests in everyone. (note: this synopsis describes the english version of the film.) ashitaka and the demon the film opens on a view of a mountainous forest shrouded in mist. a voiceover explains ancient gods and giant beasts inhabit the forests, owing their allegiance to the forest spirit. the ancient gods once lived harmoniously with humans, but times have changed. the forest is disappearing and now is the age of gods and demons. ashitaka (english: billy crudup , japanese: yôji matsuda ) is a prince of the dwindling emishi people living in the eastern forest. he rides his red elk, yakul, up the hillside from his village passing three girls along the way, including kaya (english: tara strong ), his younger sister (or, in the japanese version, the girl ashitaka has promised to marry). he tells the girls that the village oracle, hii-sama (japanese: mitsuko mori ), has sensed trouble and is ordering everyone back to the village. kaya tells him the old man ji-san noticed something from his watchtower, so ashitaka rides to see him. ashitaka climbs the tower and watches as a creature covered in wormy tendrils violently emerges from the forest. in the sun, it's revealed to be a massive boar that has turned into a demon: a tatari gami. it knocks down the tower but ashitaka and ji-san leap to safety before ashitaka pursues it on yakul. he pleads with the demon to spare their village, but the boar doesn't listen. when it attacks the three village girls, ashitaka is forced to intervene, killing it with two of his arrows. during the fight, the demon's tendrils latch onto ashitaka's right arm and, with the killing blow, dissolve, burning his skin. villagers rush up the hill, one of them carrying the elderly oracle. she gives ashitaka some water to pour over his arm before bowing before the boar, promising to perform rites and asking it to bear them no ill will. the demon bitterly responds, saying they will know its hate and grief. it dies, decomposing into a skeleton. that evening hii-sama calls the village elders together in her hut and performs a divination using fortune stones to interpret the day's events. she tells ashitaka to show his scarred arm to the others and asks if he's ready to hear his fate. when ashitaka states his resolve, she reveals the scar will spread and eventually kill him. however, instead of waiting to die, he can rise to meet his fate. she gives him an iron ball recovered from the boar's body, believing it to be the cause of his demonic transformation. the oracle tells ashitaka to ride to the west to see with eyes unclouded but warns him he can never return. ashitaka agrees, cutting his topknot as a symbol of his separation, and leaves. as he rides yakul out of the village, kaya approaches him, breaking the taboo of seeing a banished person. she gives him her crystal dagger necklace. ashitaka thanks her and says he will never forget her. he rides off, kaya staring after him. the strength of the curse ashitaka and yakul travel many miles westward, across plains and mountains. one day, they see smoke in the distance and discover samurai soldiers fighting with unarmed villagers. ashitaka rushes to the defense of a woman but, as he pulls back on his bow, his arm throbs visibly and when the arrow is released it flies with such force that it takes the samurai's sword and lodges it in a tree, with the man's arms still attached. two samurai on horseback threaten to intercept ashitaka. he yells at them to let him pass, but when they refuse, he releases another arrow, decapitating one. the other watches ashitaka flee, convinced he's a demon. as he cools his right arm under a small waterfall, ashitaka notices the mark is growing. in a town, ashitaka attempts to buy rice with a gold nugget. the seller refuses it at first, saying it isn't money, but a monk named jigo (english: billy bob thornton , japanese: kaoru kobayashi ) remarks that the nugget is pure gold and worth several bags of rice. ashitaka quickly leaves the growing crowd with his single bag. jigo follows ashitaka as he leaves town, commenting that he noticed ashitaka's fighting skills against the samurai earlier. they see some thugs following them, no doubt after ashitaka's gold, and jigo proposes a quick getaway. they camp together later, cooking their rice, and jigo mentions an ancient people called the emishi who made bowls and arrows like ashitaka's and who were rumored to ride red elk like ashitaka's, though he hints he'll keep the prince's secret. ashitaka tells jigo about his experience with the boar demon and his quest to discover its origins and shows jigo the iron ball. jigo doesn't think much of ashitaka's curse (\"you're under a curse? so what? so's the whole damn world\"), but he does tell him of a mining town further to the west, surrounded by ancient forests where giant gods still dwell. the next morning ashitaka leaves quietly to continue his journey alone while jigo sleeps. gods and spirits on a rain-slicked mountainside, a caravan of oxen and men carrying rice moves along a narrow path. their leader, lady eboshi (english: minnie driver , japanese: yûko tanaka ), keeps watch with her first lieutenant, gonza (english: john dimaggio , japanese: tsunehiko kamijô ). suddenly she notices two giant, white wolves charging down the muddy slope. a masked girl rides one of them, holding her spear high. eboshi orders her men to open fire with their ishibiya, or hand cannons. the shots drive off the wolves and gonza remarks that they weren't so big. eboshi responds that they were just pups; \"wait till you see their mother.\" as if on cue, moro (english: gillian anderson , japanese: akihiro miwa ) attacks the caravan, sending people and oxen tumbling down the mountain. moro is more than twice the size of her pups and has two tails. the guards use a flame-thrower to set her on fire and lady eboshi shoots her in the chest, sending her off the cliff. the surviving men are pleased with themselves, but eboshi reminds them that it takes more than that to kill a god. she urges the survivors onward and tells them to forget about those who fell. meanwhile, at the base of the mountain, ashitaka arrives at a river swollen from the rainfall. he sees bodies floating by and pulls out two injured men, casualties from lady eboshi's rice caravan. ashitaka notices the massive body of moro on the other side of the river, along with her pups. he watches as the warrior girl, san (english: akihiro miwa , japanese: yuriko ishida ), tends to moro, trying to suck the bullet from her wound and spitting out blood. moro's growling alerts san to ashitaka's presence. he introduces himself and asks if they are ancient gods. san tells him to go away before disappearing into the forest with the wolves. a scream brings ashitaka back to where he left the injured men. one of them, kouroku the ox-driver (english: john demita , japanese: masahiko nishimura ), has woken up and is trying to get away from a small white spirit with a bobbing head, despite his broken leg and arm. ashitaka calms him and tells him that it's a kodama, a tree spirit, and it--and the others that begin to appear--are a sign that the forest is healthy. however, kouroku is worried the creature will bring its master, a large forest spirit. ashitaka politely asks the kodama for safe passage through the forest and carries the unconscious man, a gunner, while kouroku rides yakul. the kodama lead them to a beautiful and mysterious part of the wood where mossy trees grow among pools of clear water. ashitaka sees the footprints of san and the wolves. he sets the gunner down to fetch some water and notices the tracks of a three-toed animal he doesn't recognize. he scans the area and spots a herd of deer followed closely by one with many antlers. it stops and ashitaka's arm suddenly throbs and moves on its own. he struggles to subdue it but only regains control when the mysterious deer vanishes. after the incident, ashitaka notices the gunner he's carrying seems a bit lighter. iron town they emerge from the forest where they see the iron town tatara, a large settlement across a lake. the town is protected by a tall wooden stockade. they are welcomed by a crowd and kouroku explains how ashitaka rescued them. gonza approaches and demands to know who ashitaka is and how he managed to walk through the forbidden forest with two injured men. he is cut short when kouroku's wife, toki (english: jada pinkett smith , japanese: sumi shimamoto ), runs down and berates kouroku for getting injured and risking his livelihood. she takes a moment to thank ashitaka before criticizing gonza for not taking better care of his men. lady eboshi appears above and apologizes to kouroko and toki before inviting ashitaka to see her later so she can thank him. ashitaka eats with the men of iron town. some of the women stop by and invite him to see where they work. they heckle the men before leaving, giggling to themselves. the women are former prostitutes, the men explain; lady eboshi buys the contracts of every brothel girl she finds. however, since fearless eboshi came to tatara, things have changed for the better. they tell of nago, the boar god who once ruled the forest surrounding the town. nago became enraged when the men cut trees down to get at the ore beneath the ground and often attacked with his herd of boars. when eboshi came with her gunners, she set fire to the forest and shot nago. ashitaka's arm swells in anger as he realizes that it was nago who inflicted his cursed wound, and lady eboshi who turned nago into a demon. ashitaka finds lady eboshi inspecting samples of iron set to go out with the next shipment, gonza at her side. he removes his sleeve and shows eboshi his arm, confronting her about her role in his curse. eboshi doesn't deny her responsibility but asks ashitaka's intentions. when he responds \"to see with eyes unclouded by hate,\" eboshi laughs and agrees to show ashitaka her secrets. she leaves gonza in charge and takes ashitaka to her private garden where she's enlisted a group of lepers to serve as gunsmiths for her. they conjure new guns inspired by the chinese inside their own hut. eboshi explains the guns are for the women in the fort, for their protection. she apologizes to ashitaka again for inflicting his curse, but ashitaka is angered by eboshi's production of weapons and asks how much more hate she'll spread. his arm attempts to draw his sword but ashitaka holds it down, saying that he wouldn't hesitate to kill her to lift the curse, but he fears it wouldn't stop there. an elderly leper asks ashitaka to have mercy on lady eboshi because she took pity on the lepers, caring for them and sheltering them when no one else would. he says life is hard, it is cursed, but still people find ways to keep living. up on the stockade eboshi tests her new gun, firing onto the hillside and scattering a tribe of apes attempting to plant new trees. eboshi asks ashitaka to live in tatara; once she kills the forest spirit all the other gods will be reduced to lumbering beasts and princess mononoke (which means vengeful spirit--she's referring to the wolf girl san) will be human. eboshi explains san lives to kill her. it's said the blood of the forest spirit can grant immortality and eboshi theorizes that it can cure her lepers--and maybe ashitaka's curse. ashitaka leaves and visits the forge where he tries out the bellows. the women are eager to show him and toki assures him that, despite the hard work, their lives are better here than in the brothels. san attacks meanwhile san and her two wolf brothers approach tatara. they rush down the hill and san is vaulted over the stockade and into the fort. she races over rooftops, making her way to the top of the forge. having sensed her presence, ashitaka runs to meet her while eboshi leads two women into the center square, each carrying the new guns. as eboshi prepares her trap, ashitaka begs san not to throw her life away but, at the sound of a wolf's howl, she rushes forward. a gun blast at her feet sends her plummeting off the roof and a second shot from eboshi's women breaks the mask off her face, knocking her unconscious. ashitaka uses the incredible strength of his cursed arm to rip a beam from the roof and halt the crowd before they can get to san. he shakes her awake but she attacks him and runs to eboshi. san and eboshi duel, surrounded by the cheering mob. his anger growing, ashitaka walks forward, his hate manifesting as ghostly tendrils from his arm. he easily bends the sword of gonza, who is now convinced ashitaka is in league with san. ashitaka pushes his way through the crowd before grabbing san's arm and stopping eboshi's onslaught with his sword hand. as the tendrils on his arm grow, he calls to the onlookers: \"this is what hate looks like. it's eating me alive, and soon it will kill me. fear and anger only make it grow faster.\" but eboshi grows tired of his curse, quipping that she'll cure him by removing his arm, and swings at him with a small dagger. ashitaka knocks both her and san out to stop them from fighting. he hands lady eboshi to her people and says he's taking san away. one of the women, upset at his treatment of lady eboshi, aims her gun and orders him not to move. ashitaka calmly walks away but the gun goes off, passing through his body. however, ashitaka's curse keeps him alive and he keeps walking towards the gate. when the guards won't open the gate, saying it takes ten men to lift it, ashitaka opens it himself despite bleeding profusely. san's wolf brothers wait just outside. ashitaka tells them he's bringing san out to them, and he leaves tatara with san and yakul with a final thanks to the townsfolk. yakul carries ashitaka and the unconscious san on the mountainside. soon, however, the loss of blood causes ashitaka to fall from yakul and san awakes in time to see him fall. one of san's brothers attacks ashitaka but san calls him off before confronting ashitaka about stopping her from killing eboshi. she holds his sword to his throat but he tells her to live and that she's beautiful. this shocks san but she is then interrupted by the ape clan who want to eat ashitaka in order to become strong enough to regrow the forest. san's brothers chase the apes away when they insult san since she is human. she then convinces her brothers to leave ashitaka with her. san calls yakul, whose trust she gains, to her to help carry ashitaka into the forest. in the domain of the forest spirit with yakul's help, san takes the unconscious ashitaka to the heart of the forest spirit's domain, where they cross the lake to an island. the island is the forest's holy of holies, and yakul will not set foot on it; a wise move as noted by san. she leaves ashitaka lying half in the water with his head pillowed on the soft moss of the island and sticks a sapling she cut into the ground by his head. she removes yakul's harness, telling him he's free, before swimming away. the little kodamas watch the humans before turning their attention to the horizon as a huge figure comes into view: the night walker, the forest spirit's two-legged nighttime form. they greet it with the clattering noise made by their rotating heads. the night walker lowers itself into the clearing where ashitaka lies. on a mountainside some way off, jigo watches the night walker from a hideaway, dressed in a bear skin. he points it out to his fellow hunters and explains that is the reason they're out there, despite their superstitious fears. jigo shows them the notice from the emperor giving them permission to hunt the forest spirit. they watch as the spirit resumes its deer-like form. on the island, the forest spirit walks over to look upon ashitaka. it accepts the sapling as an offering and breathes on it, causing it to wither and die. as jigo and his hunters climb down the mountain, they see hundreds of boars coming up an adjacent one. the hunters recognize the herd as one not native to the area before they see the leader: the giant, white boar god, lord okkoto (english: keith david , japanese: hisaya morishige ). jigo and the hunters run when okkoto lets out a roar, realizing he is aware of them. ashitaka wakes from a dream-like vision where he is under water as the forest spirit touches his wound, stopping the bleeding. he touches his side to find the bullet wound is gone, though nago's curse remains on his arm and has even spread to his hand. san returns to him and tells him that she knows all about him and his village, thanks to yakul, and agrees to help him since the forest spirit spared his life. she offers ashitaka meat jerky, but he's too weak to chew it. san chews for him and passes the food from her mouth to his. the act brings tears to ashitaka's eyes. moro arrives with san's brothers, then okkoto's herd of boars. they say they've come to kill humans and save the forest and demand to know why there are humans in the forest spirit's woods. san is spared their ridicule as moro's daughter and she explains the forest spirit healed ashitaka. the boars are furious; why would the forest spirit spare a human but not nago, their previous leader? moro says the forest spirit's reasons are his own. as moro herself has been wounded by the humans, she will likely die in the forest at the behest of the forest spirit. ashitaka confesses it was he who killed nago and shows his cursed hand. okkoto then comes forward and, despite being blind, inspects ashitaka's hand, sniffing at it. he believes his story, saddened that a demon came from their tribe. he then tells moro how he plans to attack the humans and, though they likely will not win, will keep fighting to the last and leave the humans in awe. after the boars leave, san and ashitaka see the forest spirit walking on the water of the lake. a skirmish a battle rages near tatara; lady eboshi and her men are fighting lord asano and his samurai, who wish to control the ore-rich lands. however, asano's men are decimated by eboshi's gunfire. as eboshi returns to tatara, she meets jigo, who accompanies her into the fort. lady eboshi tells jigo that lord asano has offered to back off if she gives him half her iron but, as a messenger arrives at the gates, she shuts the door and leaves her women to taunt the horseman. \"you want some of our iron? here you go!\" they shoot at the messenger, who flees. jigo laughs at the women's bravado before introducing the note sent from the mikado (the emperor) himself requesting the head of the forest spirit for a large sum. the emperor believes that the head will give him immortal life and jigo is keen to collect the reward with eboshi's help. if she refuses he alludes to the fact that his small army of rifleman could be put to better use alongside asano's forces. lady eboshi shows the mikado's letter to her women who have no idea who the emperor is, demonstrating that out here the mikado has no true power; it lies in the strength of her people. she tells jigo she will help him hunt the forest spirit and tells him that it will be done her way, with no loss of human life, and requests that he remove his riflemen from their hiding place in the hills. jigo laughs at her cunning. before she goes, he asks eboshi whether a young man riding an elk came to tatara. \"came, and went,\" lady eboshi replies. jigo's riflemen take up residence in the fort and are regarded with suspicion due to their solemn nature. eboshi meets with her women and explains that they must remain in the fort and defend against asano, since she doesn't trust the men. gonza assures them he'll protect eboshi but the women scorn him, saying, \"that's what we're afraid of.\" moro's cave ashitaka wakes in moro's cave, high above the trees, and finds san sleeping beside him. he gets up, his arm throbbing, and walks out onto the rock ledge to look down on the forest. moro, perched on the rocks above him, suggests that he jump to end his pain. ashitaka asks what's been happening and moro tells him that he's been asleep for days. she's sorry he didn't cry out in his sleep because then she would have felt justified in biting his head off to keep him quiet. the boars are on the move, moro says, and she can feel the pain of the forest as it dies beneath their rampaging feet. ashitaka asks why the humans and the forest can't live together in peace but moro laughs, saying such a thing can't happen. she longs for the day when she can kill eboshi. there will be a battle, she predicts, and san will fight alongside the gods and die with them. when ashitaka objects, saying that she's human, moro becomes angry and reveals that she once attacked some humans who invaded the forest. in their terror, the people threw their baby at moro. the baby was san; moro kept her and raised her. though she loves san, moro understands that san will never fully belong anywhere--either to the wolves or the humans--and there's nothing moro or ashitaka can do about that. moro tells ashitaka to leave her cave by dawn; if he comes back she'll kill him. when ashitaka wakes up again in the cave it's broad daylight and san and moro are gone. ashitaka gathers his things, finding supplies neatly left for him. still very weak, he stumbles down to yakul. one of the wolf brothers escorts him out of the forest and on to a path to tatara. ashitaka throws kaya's crystal dagger necklace to the wolf, asking him to give it to san. a battle san rides her wolf brother to meet moro on a mountainside overlooking a barren hillside where eboshi's men have cut down trees and built fires stinking with sulfur to blunt the animals' sense of smell in anticipation of battle with the forest gods. moro recognizes the trap; the boars will run straight to the humans, blinded and enraged by the felled trees. okkoto is too stubborn to change his tactics and will run head-on. san says she's going to help okkoto; she feels that with neither eyes nor sense of smell to depend on, lord okkoto needs her more than moro does. moro tells san that she can go away with ashitaka if she wants--\"that boy wanted to share his life with you.\" san replies bitterly that she hates humans. but when her second brother arrives and gives her ashitaka's necklace, she seems touched at the gift. san puts it around her neck as she says goodbye to moro, who will go and wait for the forest spirit. san and the young wolves go off together to join the boars, who are running headlong into battle. ashitaka rides towards tatara, dejected, before he hears the explosions set off by the rampaging boars. however, closer gunfire draws his attention and he discovers that tatara is under siege. as he nears the town, some samurai try to stop him. yakul leaps over them, jumps into the lake, and swims for tatara as ashitaka deflects the samurais' arrows with his sword. they find that asano's men have breached the outer wall of tatara and the women are holed up in the center, still defending the fort. they ask ashitaka to carry word of their plight to lady eboshi and bring her back. kouroku returns ashitaka's bow and arrows. ashitaka rides off, pursued by samurai on horseback. as he crosses the mountains he comes to one smoking from the remains of the boar battle. a samurai shoots an arrow into yakul's haunch. his anger increasing and his curse spreading, ashitaka stops to fight. his arrows take the arm off one samurai and decapitate another before the remaining samurai rides off. ashitaka pulls the arrow out of yakul's hindquarters and tries to leave him behind, saying he'll come back for him later, but yakul limps along behind him. they reach the part of the battlefield where lady eboshi's men and a few of jigo's mercenaries are burying their dead. ashitaka sees men covered in cloth awaiting burial and dead boars piled everywhere. he is told by an iron worker that they were used as bait; boars came at them, igniting mines buried underground while grenades were dropped by mercenaries from above. ashitaka learns that san was in the battle but she is not among the dead. he then tells the men that tatara is being attacked and he needs to deliver a message to eboshi. two mercenaries demand the men get back to work digging but the iron workers argue, saying they must return to tatara and that a tracker must be sent for eboshi. ashitaka then finds one of san's wolf brothers pinned under a boar and attempts to free him. seeing this as treason, the mercenaries try to subdue ashitaka with poisoned darts but the iron workers revolt against them and help ashitaka free the wolf. ashitaka leaves yakul in the care of the iron workers and runs off with the wolf towards the forest. an ambush in the forest, a hunter reports to jigo and lady eboshi that lord okkoto is badly wounded and heading for the domain of the forest spirit; san is with him. san walks with okkoto and her other wolf brother. okkoto is bleeding heavily and losing strength. he stops as a clan of ape gods appear in the trees overhead, throwing sticks and claiming that san's actions have brought terrible things into the forest: \"bad things coming--neither human or animal.\" san is unable to smell anything over the blood and can only watch as small animals run from the oncoming threat. a boar appears behind them, followed by many others, but they slither across the ground unnaturally. san realizes they're humans wearing boar skins. okkoto believes them to be his warriors returned from the dead. renewed but delirious, he walks on towards the domain of the forest spirit. san fears that okkoto will become a demon; like nago before him, he's defeated, mortally wounded, and filled with fear and hate. she sends her wolf brother to tell moro what's happening but stays with okkoto herself, hoping to avert his change, but there's nothing she can do. san begs him to stop, but okkoto ignores her and soon his anger and fear begin to bubble out of him in bloody tendrils as he transforms into a demon. as she fends off the 'ghost boars', san hears one of her wolf brothers howling a message: ashitaka is looking for her. an answering howl from the other brother tells ashitaka that san is in danger, more true than they know--san is knocked out by a hunter's slingshot and sucked into the tendrils covering okkoto. demon-okkoto resumes his rush toward the heart of the forest. ashitaka mounts the wolf to move faster and soon comes upon lady eboshi. he dismounts to tell eboshi to halt her death march and return to help tatara before running ahead, but lady eboshi, intent on finding and killing the forest spirit, says the women must take care of themselves and keeps moving. jigo is confused as to whose side ashitaka is on. behind lady eboshi's back, some of jigo's men wonder if they can do without her, but jigo says killing gods is dangerous business--he's happy to let her do it. ashitaka reaches the forest spirit's pool, where he finds moro dying at the water's edge. demon-okkoto arrives, still followed by the hunters in boar skins. san calls to ashitaka and he can see her struggling on okkoto's snout, growing demon-tendrils herself. ashitaka leaps onto okkoto's snout and tries to dig san out while the wolf brothers fight off the hunters, but ashitaka is thrown off by the demon before he can get to san. he bounces off of moro and lands in the water, stunned. moro, who was saving the last of her strength to fight lady eboshi, rouses herself to confront the demon and drags san out of the mass of tendrils. as moro frees san, the forest spirit approaches in its deer form, walking across the water. jigo and lady eboshi can see it from their hiding place. quelled by its appearance, okkoto backs away and the tendrils begin to melt. ashitaka wakes in the water to the sound of moro's voice asking him to save san. he comes to the surface and sees lady eboshi shoot the forest spirit, though he cries out to her to stop. the forest spirit stops and sinks a bit when it's hit, but recovers and keeps walking. ashitaka takes san from moro and returns to the water to wash the demon tendrils from her. meanwhile, the forest spirit takes the lives of okkoto and moro, to the surprise of the humans. eboshi comments that life and death are his to give and take. the forest spirit begins to make its change into the night walker and eboshi turns to the hunters. \"watch closely, everyone. i'm going to show you how to kill a god,\" says lady eboshi. \"the trick is not to fear him.\" seeing her take aim, ashitaka throws his sword and hits her ishibiya, which only distracts her for a moment. the forest spirit looks at lady eboshi and plants sprout from the wooden parts of her gun, but this doesn't stop her either. she fires and hits the half-transformed forest spirit in the neck, separating its head which falls to the ground. horrible black goo spouts from the neck, killing whatever it falls on. dead kodamas fall from the trees all around. lady eboshi grabs the severed head and gives it to jigo. porters come up carrying a round metal box. jigo puts the head in the box and they run off. human hands moro's head, apparently detached from her body by the black ooze, wriggles forward and bites off lady eboshi's arm before bouncing away into the ooze. while san and her brothers take refuge on the forest spirit's holy island, ashitaka takes eboshi and swims to the island with her while gonza wades after him, having never learned to swim. san rips the crystal necklace from around her neck and orders ashitaka to let her kill eboshi, but he assures san that moro's revenge has been taken and tells eboshi he promised the women he'd return her to them. angry at ashitaka, san stabs him with the dagger but he hugs her close, saying that despite everything they're still alive and can still save the forest, if she'll help him. meanwhile the night walker prowls the forest in search of its head, spreading black ooze and destruction with every step. it grows reaching arms from its neck and sends them down into the forest, chasing after jigo and the three porters. in tatara, it's quiet. the women are guarding the walls and keeping an eye on lord asano's camp while one of the leper gunsmiths fixes toki's ishibiya. looking up at the mountain, they see the headless night walker and its tide of black, killing ooze coming over the ridge toward the town. it destroys lord asano's encampments and keeps coming. ashitaka, san, and her wolf brothers arrive and ashitaka tells the women and the lepers to get in the lake to escape the ooze. urged on by toki, most of the people manage to get away before the ooze overruns the town. standing in the water, they watch as the forge catches fire and burns. san, ashitaka, and the wolves go after jigo and the head. when they catch jigo, ashitaka demands that the head be returned to the night walker. jigo pleads to keep it, noting the sun is about to rise, before he attacks ashitaka and tells the other porters to run. san chases them but they are stopped by the forest spirit. in their fear, they drop the metal box and it rolls down the hill. jigo stops it, tumbling down the hill a ways and coming to rest on a large rock. san, ashitaka, and one porter catch up to him as a tide of ooze surrounds them. ashitaka convinces him there's nothing else to be done and says \"human hands must return it.\" jigo opens the box and ashitaka and san hold the head up, begging the forest spirit to take it and be at peace. the spirit leans forward and takes its head back, showering them all in a bright light. on the lake, the tatara refugees watch the night walker straighten up with its head back in place and resume its usual appearance of starry transparency. rafts approach carrying lady eboshi, gonza, and the rest of the iron town men; the two groups are happily reunited. without having returned to its glade before sunrise, the night walker collapses at the dawn, falling on tatara and blowing much of it away in a strong wind. the burning remains of the town and asano's camp fly away into the barren hills which slowly turn green with new growth and sprouting plants. kouroku looks on in amazement and the lepers look down at themselves to find they've been healed. yakul, who arrived on the rafts with the men, finds san and ashitaka asleep in the grass beside her wolf brothers. yakul wakes them and they find that the forest spirit has disappeared. san is distraught at the forest spirit's death but ashitaka assures her it cannot die, since it is life itself. he looks at his hand which is scarred, but curse free. san tells ashitaka that she likes him but cannot forgive humans for what they've done. he understands and tells her that he will live at tatara and help them rebuild so that they can live alongside the forest and will visit her often. san nods and departs with her brothers. lady eboshi, recovering from the loss of her arm, is humbly optimistic. sitting with her women and gonza, she promises to start anew and build a better town. she sends for ashitaka to thank him. jigo, perched on the rocks high above with his one remaining porter, laughs to himself, saying, \"well, i give up. you can't win against fools.\" around the dead trees near the forest spirit's pool, new trees are growing. among them walks a little white kodama, rattling its head."

    "overview": "after young riley is uprooted from her midwest life and moved to san francisco, her emotions, joy, fear, anger, disgust, and sadness, conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school.",
    "synopsis": "Riley, an 11-year-old Minnesota girl, moves with her family to San Francisco after her father’s new job. Inside Riley’s mind, five core emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger — reside in headquarters, guiding actions from a central control console. When the move unsettles Riley, Joy tries to keep her happy while Sadness is sidelined. An accident causes Sadness to touch happy memories, creating a sad core memory and destabilizing the islands that represent Riley’s personality. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of headquarters into the long-term memory system and must navigate memory dump, storage labyrinths, and derailed pathways to return. Anger, Disgust, and Fear attempt to maintain order, but Riley’s world crumbles: Goofball and Friendship Islands fall first, and she distances from parents, friends, and hockey. In the memory labyrinth, Riley’s imaginary friend Bing Bong appears; together they ride the Train of Thought toward headquarters, but a failed derailment scatters more memories. Joy’s fear of loss worsens when the recall tube breaks; she and Sadness eventually reach headquarters where Anger’s plan has frozen the console, leaving Riley depressed. Sadness takes control, reactivates the system, and helps Riley realize that both happiness and sorrow are essential. They reassemble core memories, rebuild a new island, and Riley stabilizes at home in San Francisco, better adapting and forming new friendships and interests over the following year, with Joy and Sadness now coordinating in a larger, more integrated emotional system.",

      "a girl named riley (kaitlyn dias) is born in minnesota, and within her mind, five personifications of her core emotions-joy (amy poehler), sadness (phyllis smith), disgust (mindy kaling) (keeps riley from being poisoned by consuming unknown items), fear (bill hader) (keeps riley safe), and anger (lewis black) (wants things to be fair)-come to life. the emotions live in headquarters, riley's conscious mind, where they influence riley's actions and memories via a control console. each emotion takes control of the central console depending on the situation that riley is in.\nher new memories are housed in colored orbs, which are sent into storage at the end of every waking period. the most important or \"core\" memories are housed in a hub in headquarters (each core memory represents an important event in riley's life like when she scored her first goal) and each core memory powers a different personality island. currently there are five \"islands\" (hockey, goofball, friendship, family and honesty island), each of which reflects a different aspect of riley's personality. joy acts as the dominant emotion to keep riley in a happy state, but she and the others do not understand sadness's purpose, other than making riley cry. joy perceives sadness as an unnecessary burden for riley. when riley is 11 years old, her family (mom (diane lane) and dad (kyle maclachlan)) moves to san francisco after her father gets a new job. however, their new home is tiny, filthy, lifeless, and their belongings are still in a moving truck that ends up getting lost somewhere in texas. riley is a hockey player and used to open spaces, and fells confined in the urban congestion of san francisco.\njoy becomes concerned when sadness begins touching happy memories, causing them to turn sad, so she tries to keep sadness isolated.\njoy believes that with sadness out of the way, riley will have a good day, a good week and then a good year and a good life. however, on riley's first day at her new school, the teacher asks riley to introduce herself. joy brings up her hockey memory to help riley talk about it. sadness comes out of her isolation and touches the hockey memory and turns it into a sad memory, and accidentally causes riley to cry in front of her class, creating a sad core memory. joy attempts to dispose of the new core memory before it reaches the central hub, but she accidentally knocks the other core memories loose in her struggle with sadness, shutting down the personality islands and making them unstable. before joy can put them back, she, sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of headquarters through the memory tube leading to the rest of riley's mind. they end up in the labyrinthine storage area of riley's long-term memories and set out to return to headquarters. anger, disgust, and fear attempt to maintain riley's emotional state in joy's absence, but inadvertently distance riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies, resulting in her personality islands slowly crumbling and falling into the memory dump, an abyss where faded memories are disposed and forgotten. the goofball personality island is the first to go.\nsadness had read the mind manuals and only she knew the way back to headquarters. so, joy was stuck with her. after riley has a fight with her friend in minnesota, the friendship island also crumbles and falls away into the memory dump.\nmeanwhile, anger, intending to restore riley's happiness, convinces disgust and fear that riley should run away to minnesota, where her happy memories were formed. meanwhile, joy and sadness find bing bong (richard kind), riley's childhood imaginary friend (mostly made of cotton candy and part cat, part elephant, part dolphin), who is desperate to reconnect with her.\nas riley grew up, she forgot about her imaginary friend and he was discarded into the long term memory section.\nhe tells them they can get to headquarters by riding the train of thought. after exploring different areas of riley's mind, the three eventually catch the train, but it derails when another personality island falls. joy, who is afraid all of the core memories will become sad, abandons sadness. as riley prepares to board a bus bound for minnesota, joy attempts to use a \"recall tube\" to return to headquarters, but the last personality island falls and breaks the tube, sending joy into the memory dump along with bing bong. while despairingly looking through old memories, joy discovers a sad memory in riley's life that becomes happy when her parents and friends come to comfort her over losing a hockey game, causing her to realize sadness's true importance: alerting others when riley needs help or comforting. joy and bing bong try to use bing bong's discarded wagon rocket to get out of the memory dump, but after several failed attempts, bing bong realizes their combined weight is too much and jumps out and fades away, allowing joy to escape. joy uses various tools from imagination land to propel herself and sadness to headquarters, where they find that anger's idea has disabled the control console, rendering riley depressed and apathetic. at joy's urging, sadness takes control and successfully removes the idea, reactivating the console and prompting riley to return home. as sadness re-installs the core memories, riley arrives home and breaks down in tears, confessing to her parents that she misses her old life, and she cannot keep pretending to be happy and content all the time. as her parents' comfort and reassure her, joy and sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory that is both happy and sad, and a new island forms, representing riley's acceptance of her life in san francisco. one year later, a 12-year old riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and acquired new hobbies. inside headquarters, riley's emotions admire her new personality islands, powered by core memories that contain a mixture of emotions, and are given an expanded console that has enough room for them to work as a team. although they admit slight concern over a large red alarm marked puberty, they forget about it."

Billy Costigan, undercover cop, embeds with Frank Costello’s Irish-American mob; Colin Sullivan, MSP detective, is Costello’s mole inside the police unit. Both men build cover stories while secretly gathering intelligence for their respective sides. As raids and deals unfold, both learn there is a rat among their ranks. Sullivan seeks the informer in Costello’s crew; Costigan probes the police to identify Sullivan. A web of deception tightens: Costello’s crew beat Costigan to prove loyalty; Costigan exposes Costello’s status as an FBI informant and passes intelligence upward. Relationships complicate loyalties: Costigan dates Madolyn Madden; Sullivan pursues her while feeding Costello tips. Key moments include Queenan’s death protecting Costigan, Sullivan’s diary reveal, and the discovery that Costello has multiple informants. The climax erupts in a warehouse gunfight; Costigan and Sullivan uncover each other as moles, then shootouts escalate. Costigan dies; Sullivan frames another officer as the mole, ending with his own survival and a bloodied, hollow victory as the others fall and the city’s rat remains at large.",

      "in the 1980s, young colin sullivan (matt damon) is introduced to organized crime by irish american mobster frank costello (jack nicholson) in the irish neighborhood of south boston. costello explains that he doesn't want to be the product of his environment, he wants his environment to be a product of him. costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want. costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, a man visibly unnerved by costello. costello warns him to have more money next time. a young colin sullivan, witnesses costello's interaction with the shop owner. costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man costello knows. he tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand. he tells the boy to remember he can get more money from costello when he gets older. as sullivan comes up in age, costello trains sullivan to become a mole inside the massachusetts state police (msp). sullivan is accepted into the special investigations unit led by ellerby (alec baldwin) which focuses on organized crime. before he graduates from the police academy, billy costigan (leonardo dicaprio) is asked by captain queenan (martin sheen) and staff sergeant dignam (mark wahlberg) to go undercover, as his family ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. they pressure him to disqualify himself as an officer because he's too smart to be a cop and because of his family's ties to crime. when costigan stands up to their hazing, they change tactics: they offer him a job as a police officer on one condition: that he quit the academy, serve serious time in jail on a trumped-up assault charge, and infiltrate costello's organization. only queenan and dignam will know that costigan is working undercover. they promise him a bonus when he completes the assignment. costigan drops out of the academy and serves a term in prison for his cover and further commits several crimes, drawing costello's attention. costigan confronts two italian mobsters from providence extorting protection money from the store owner. he beats the two men up badly, breaking his hand when he hits one of them. costello learns of costigan's actions and summons him to a meeting. he offers to protect costigan from the mafia, who, he promises, will return with reinforcements to kill costigan. he invites costigan into a back room where he instructs mr. french, a senior member of costello's crew, to check costigan for weapons or a wire. mr. french breaks costigan's cast open and costello beats costigan's broken hand with a shoe, trying to get him to confess being a cop. costigan withstands their beating and is accepted as a legitimate crook by costello. as both infiltrate their respective organizations, sullivan begins a romance with psychiatrist madolyn madden (vera farmiga). costigan sees her for his probation and also develops a relationship with her.\nduring a deal to sell stolen missile guidance microchips to chinese government agents, sullivan warns costello of the police operation and everyone avoids police detection by boarding boats waiting at the back of the warehouse. over the next year, costigan becomes increasingly involved. his mental state declines but queenan and dignam convince him to continue. costigan begins seeing madolyn for his court-ordered therapy. after costello escapes a sting operation, both moles become aware of the other's existence. the msp and costello both realize they have moles in their respective organizations and task costigan and sullivan to find them. sullivan is told to find the \"rat\" and asks costello for information to determine who is the informer within his crew.\nsullivan asks for his crew members' social security numbers and other forms of id so he can track them down. costigan searches for the informant and learns from a member of costello's crew that costello himself is an fbi informant, explaining why federal prosecutors repeatedly fail to indict and arrest costello. costigan visits queenan at home late at night and tells him that costello is an fbi informant. mr. french collects everyone's social security numbers and other id. costigan corrects fitzgibbons's (david o'hara) misspelling of 'citizens' on the envelope containing their information and then leaves. he visits madden at her apartment, where she is finishing moving out. she tells him she is moving in with sullivan. they talk and then have sex. one night, costigan follows costello into an adult theater and witnesses him giving a dark figure who was in fact, sullivan, an envelope containing information on his crew. costigan is instructed to get a visual id of sullivan but is unsuccessful. when sullivan realizes he is being followed, he stabs a man, mistaking him for costigan, and flees. costigan, fearing costello will soon discover and kill him for being the mole, calls queenan to end the undercover operation, but sullivan has queenan followed, lying to the other officers that queenan may be the spy. sullivan also calls costello's gang to inform them of the meeting. when costello's men arrive, queenan helps costigan escape before being thrown from the building to his death. when they exit, costigan pretends he has come to join them. this causes a firefight between the police and costello's men. angered by queenan's murder, dignam attacks sullivan and is suspended. later, costello's henchman, fitzgibbons (david o'hara), reveals that delahunt (mark rolston), a crew member, was an undercover cop. timothy delahunt, one of costello's henchmen wounded in the gunfight fingers costigan as the mole but dies before he can tell anyone else. consequently, dignam is forced to step down from the police force. using queenan's phone, sullivan reaches costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. sullivan learns of costello's role as an informant for the fbi from queenan's diary, causing him to worry about his identity being revealed. with costigan's help, costello is traced to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between his crew and police, resulting in most of the crew being killed. costello, confronted by sullivan, admits he is an occasional fbi informant. sullivan then shoots him multiple times. with costello dead, sullivan is applauded the next day by everyone on the force.\nin good faith, costigan comes to him for restoration of his true identity. his assignment finished, costigan goes to sullivan to reveal his undercover status, unaware he is another mole. after sullivan leaves the room, costigan recognizes the envelope from the theater on his desk. realizing sullivan was costello's mole, costigan escapes. knowing he has been found out, sullivan erases all records of costigan from the police computer system.\nmadolyn tells sullivan that she is pregnant but does not reveal who the father is. costigan visits madolyn, who has told sullivan but not costigan she's pregnant, knowing that sullivan may not be the father, and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. later, she discovers a package from costigan containing a cd with recordings of costello's conversations with sullivan. sullivan walks in as she is listening and tries unsuccessfully to assuage her suspicions. he contacts costigan, who reveals that costello recorded every conversation he had with sullivan. costello's attorney left costigan in possession of the recordings and he intends to implicate sullivan. costigan arranges to meet sullivan on the same rooftop where queenan was killed. on the roof, costigan catches sullivan off-guard and handcuffs him. as costigan had secretly arranged, officer brown appears on the roof as well. shocked, brown draws his gun on costigan, who attempts to justify his actions by exposing sullivan as the rat. costigan asks brown why dignam did not accompany him, but brown does not answer. costigan leads sullivan to the elevator. when it reaches the ground floor, costigan is shot in the head by officer barrigan, who then shoots brown and reveals to sullivan that costello had more than one mole in the police. brown reaches the lobby but is also killed by barrigan. sullivan shoots barrigan dead, so that he can frame him as the only mole. at police headquarters, sullivan identifies barrigan as the mole and has costigan posthumously given the medal of merit. at costigan's funeral, sullivan notices madolyn silently crying. he realizes they were involved, but when he attempts to talk to her about the baby, she ignores him. later, when sullivan arrives home, dignam is waiting for him and, after sullivan indifferently accepts his fate, dignam shoots him in the head, killing him and avenging both queenan and costigan before leaving. the final shot shows a rat crawling on the rail of the patio with the massachusetts state house in the distance."

      "a group of sentient toys, who pretend to be lifeless when humans are around, are preparing to move into a new house with their young owner andy davis (john morris), his infant sister molly (hannah unkrich), and their single mother mrs. davis (laurie metcalf). andy's birthday is also coming up and mrs. davis is throwing a party for the same.\nsid (erik von detten) is andy's next-door neighbor and bully, who destroys toys for fun. hannah (sarah freeman) is sid's friendly sister. learning that andy's birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to that very day, several toys - including mr. potato head (don rickles) a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body, slinky dog (jim varney) a dachshund slinky toy and woody's second-in-command, rex the tyrannosaur (wallace shawn) a nervous green tyrannosaurus figurine, hamm (john ratzenberger) a smart talking piggy bank, and bo peep (annie potts) a porcelain shepherdess doll and woody's love interest become concerned that andy might receive something that will replace them.\nwoody, a pull string cowboy doll, and andy's favorite toy and their leader, is the only toy who gets to say his own lines because he has a pull-string that makes him say things. woody starts by reminding them all to find a moving buddy so they don't get lost when the davis family moves to their new house, which will happen in a week. then he tries to downplay the news that andy's birthday party is happening today, but it causes a commotion as the toys know that andy's actual birthday isn't till next week. rex worries that someone will give andy another dinosaur, and many of the toys have similar concerns. he's interrupted when hamm the piggy-bank, stationed near the window, announces that the guests are arriving. the toys rush to the window to see the presents the kids are bringing; the bigger boxes make them especially nervous. to calm them, sheriff woody (tom hanks) sends sarge (r. lee ermey) the leader of a large troop of plastic green army men, and his green army men to spy on andy's birthday party with a baby monitor.\nat first, the presents seem nonthreatening including a lunchbox, bed sheets and a battleship game.\nandy receives a space ranger buzz lightyear (tim allen) a space ranger universe protection unit action figure, whose interesting features threaten woody's position as andy's favorite toy. the new toy has taken woody's place on the bed, which causes consternation. woody reminds them that no one is being replaced. buzz does not realize that he is a toy when woody attempts to convince him and thinks that he is a real space ranger. buzz believes he's crash landed on a strange planet on the way to sector 12, and his ship is damaged. the toys impressed with buzz's features including a laser (a little light bulb that blinks), and wings. buzz takes exception to being called a toy, and when woody says he can't really fly, buzz climbs the bedpost, shouts \"to infinity and beyond!\", and dives. he bounces off a rubber ball, does a loop-de-loop on the racetrack, and gets stuck for a few rotations on the toy plane tethered to the ceiling before flipping down and landing neatly back on the bed. while the other toys befriend buzz, woody becomes jealous of him and starts to feel left out when andy starts going to sleep with buzz. andy has buzz shoot woody, then puts on a cardboard replica of buzz's helmet and wings. a western-themed poster in andy's room is replaced by two buzz lightyear posters, and drawings of woody on the bulletin board are covered with drawings of buzz. the western-style bedspread disappears, and the new one is emblazoned with buzz's image and his name. in the final indignity, andy takes buzz to bed and leaves woody in the covered wagon toy chest. two days before the move, andy's family plans for a dinner at pizza planet and andy is told that he can bring one toy with him. andy prepares to go to a family outing at a space-themed pizza planet restaurant with buzz. still wanting to stay close to andy, and still jealous of buzz, woody tries knocking buzz behind the desk with rc, the radio-controlled car.\nandy's attempt starts a chain reaction that knocks buzz out a window instead into andy's next-door neighbor, sid phillips yard. however, most of the other toys believe woody has deliberately killed buzz. with buzz missing, andy takes woody to pizza planet with him instead. however, buzz climbs into the car and confronts woody when they stop at a gas station. the two toys fight and accidentally fall out of the car, which drives off and leaves them behind. woody sees a pickup truck bound for pizza planet and plans to rendezvous with andy there, convincing buzz to come with him by saying that the pickup truck can take him to his home planet.\nthey reach pizza planet and hide in discarded food packaging so they can sneak through the front door. woody quickly spots the davises.\nonce at pizza planet, buzz makes his way into a claw game machine shaped like a spaceship, thinking that it is the ship that woody had promised him to take him back home. inside, he finds a horde of squeaky aliens (jeff pidgeon) who revere the machine's claw arm as their master. when woody follows buzz into the game to try to rescue him, the two of them are captured by sid, who likes to torture and destroy toys for fun. sid takes them back to his house. sid immediately gives the three-eyed alien to his vicious dog, scud, who starts chewing on it. at sid's house, the two toys stage numerous attempts to escape before andy's moving day, encountering nightmarish hodge-podge toys of sid's creation. there's an erector-set spider with a one-eyed baby head, a jack-in-the-box whose jack has been replaced by a green rubber hand, a fishing pole with legs, and other horrors. buzz thinks they're cannibals. next morning, sid interrogates woody about the location of a \"rebel base.\" when woody remains silent, sid uses a magnifying glass to concentrate the sunlight on a spot between woody's eyebrows, which starts to smoke. woody is saved when sid is called away to eat his pop-tarts. buzz compliments woody for not succumbing to sid's torture. buzz tries his laser on them and is puzzled when it doesn't work. woody pushes the button that activates buzz's karate-chop action and frog-marches him through the crowd of toys, which parts to let them through. in the living room, the tv is on and buzz sees a commercial for buzz lightyear action figures just like himself and realizes that woody was right about him being a toy. unable to face the truth, buzz tries to prove he is still a space ranger by attempting to fly out of the window but falls and loses one of his arms. buzz falls into depression over the truth, making him unable to participate in woody's escape plan which forces woody to try and get the other toys attention in andy's room by waving buzz's disconnected arm, but the other toys leave him behind as they still resent woody for what happened to buzz. woody realizes that sid's mutant toys are friendly when they fix buzz's arm, but is still unable to make buzz co-operate, forcing him to leave him behind and hide when sid arrives. sid prepares to destroy buzz by strapping him to a rocket but is delayed by a thunderstorm and sleeps for the night. next door, it's andy's bedtime and he's mourning the loss of his two favorite toys. his mom comes in and says she's looked everywhere, and all she can find is his hat, which she gives him. andy's mom reassures him that they'll find woody and buzz before they move out the next day. woody convinces buzz life is worth living even if he is not a space ranger because of the joy he can bring to andy, and helps buzz regain his spirit. sid takes buzz out to blow him up, but woody rallies the mutant toys to come to life in front of sid and frighten him into never harming toys again. woody outlines a plan and assigns tasks to each toy. ducky and legs go into the heating ducts to avoid scud, who saw woody trying to follow sid and is still growling outside the bedroom door. ducky and legs get outside by removing the light fixture on the front porch, then ring the doorbell. when he hears the doorbell, woody releases a wind-up frog from sid's room. the frog scoots under scud and zooms down the hall. scud gives chase and follows the frog downstairs, where hannah's answering the door. the frog goes out, ducky grabs it, and they're both reeled up by legs (who's part fishing pole) before scud catches up. hannah, exasperated, shuts the door, leaving scud outside. the porch light fixture drops back into place before anyone notices it's gone. as soon as hannah's out of the front hall, woody and his cadre of toys come down the stairs, roll through the kitchen, and exit through the cat flap in the back door. they land in the bushes, where they have a good view of the launch site. sid's newscaster voice is asking his mission control voice if launch pad construction is complete; mission control says it is. sid himself is out of sight, apparently rummaging around in the shed looking for matches. ducky, legs, and the wind-up frog pop out of a down-spout as sid prepares to start the count-down. the launch pad looks very strange. buzz and his rocket are standing on a dart board on a milk crate. nearby is an orange-striped traffic horse with a rake leaning on it and the empty water jug propped underneath. the jug is connected with vacuum-cleaner hose to a red funnel, which is aimed at buzz's feet. woody approaches buzz, who's happy to see him and asks for help getting loose. sid tosses woody on the charcoal grill. he puts a match in woody's holster and turns back to his rocket launch, where he lights another match and starts counting down from 10. while he's focused on this, toys are taking up positions all around the yard. before sid can light buzz's fuse, woody's voice recordings start playing, one after another. sid is distracted and comes over to pick woody up off the grill. his string hasn't been pulled. a large toy pickup truck emerges from a pile of sand while a couple of partially dismembered soldier action figures rise out of a puddle. they all advance on sid, who backs away and jumps when the three-eyed alien from pizza planet pops out from under scud's red water bowl. sid backs toward the clothesline and the baby-headed spider drops down on his head. he shrieks and shakes it off, but the toys have him surrounded. sid is panic-stricken. he screams, throws woody in the air, and runs into the house, where he tells hannah the toys are alive. woody and buzz miss andy's car as it drives away to his new house. now freed, woody and buzz pursue the davis's moving truck, but scud attacks woody.\nrunning down the road, they climb onto a moving truck, but scud chases them. woody can't hold on to the truck and tells buzz to take care of andy for him. buzz, sacrificing himself to save woody, jumps on scud's head, making him let go of woody. woody attempts to rescue buzz with andy's rc car but the other toys, who think that woody got rid of rc, toss woody off onto the road. rc sweeps woody off his feet and woody turns rc up to turbo so they can catch up to the moving truck.\nspotting woody driving rc back with buzz alive, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them into the truck. when rc's batteries become depleted, rc coughs to a stop in the middle of the road as the moving van disappears in the distance. then buzz remembers he still has a rocket strapped to his back, and woody remembers he still has the match sid put in his holster. woody ignites the rocket on buzz's back and manages to throw rc into the moving truck just in time before they go soaring into the air. buzz then opens his wings to cut himself free before the rocket explodes. they pass the truck again and fall through the minivan's sunroof, landing neatly in the box next to andy, who finds them and gleefully tells his mom. she assumes they've been in the car the whole time. on christmas eve at their new house, buzz and woody stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals, one of which is a mrs. potato head, much to the delight of mr. potato head. woody jokingly asks buzz \"what could andy possibly get that is worse than you?\", a question which is immediately answered. andy's new gift, as it turns out, is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile."

    "synopsis": "In 18th/early 19th-century Qing China, Li Mubai, a renowned Wudang swordsman about to retire, entrusts the Green Destiny sword to Yu Shu Lian for safekeeping. A masked thief steals the blade at Sir Te’s estate, triggering a pursuit across Beijing and beyond. Yu Xiulian, Li Mubai’s confidant, partners with Li Mubai’s friend Meng Sizhao’s memory but both silently guard Mu Bai’s past. Jade Fox, a vengeful female master who killed Mu Bai’s instructor, manipulates events from the shadows, posing as Jen Yu to hide among the Yu family. Jade Fox’s pursuit intersects with Jen Yu, Yu’s betrothed daughter, whose own talent with the sword draws Mu Bai and Shu Lien into a dangerous game of loyalty, love, and betrayal. Jen studies the Wudang manual, surpasses Jade Fox in skill, and clashes with Shu Lien in a duel where Green Destiny’s power repeatedly weaponizes their fates. Mu Bai intervenes to mentor Jen after a final duel, but Jade Fox reappears, dying in the process after mortally wounding Shu Lien and Mu Bai by a poisoned dart. Jen escapes with the aid of Jade Dragon’s lineage, while Mu Bai’s dying confession of love to Shu Lien and the return of Green Destiny to Sir Te mark the end of one blood-stained cycle. Jen reunites with Lo in the desert, where they part with a legend of wishes, and Jen leaps from a bridge to pursue an impossible reunion among the clouds.",

      "in 18th-century qing dynasty china, li mu bai (chow yun-fat) is a wudang swordsman, and yu shu lien (michelle yeoh) heads a private security company. yu shu lien and li mu bai long have feelings for each other, but because shu lien had been engaged to mu bai's close friend, meng sizhao before his death. shu lien and mu bai feel bound by loyalty to meng sizhao and have not acted on their feelings for each other. mu bai, choosing to retire, asks shu lien to give his fabled sword \"green destiny\" to their benefactor sir te (sihung lung) in peking. long ago, mu bai's teacher was killed by jade fox (cheng pei-pei), a woman who sought to learn wudang skills. while at sir te's place, shu lien makes the acquaintance of yu jen (zhang ziyi), who is the daughter of rich and powerful governor yu (li fazeng) and is about to get married. yu jen meets shu lien and tells her that she is excited by the warrior life and doesn't want to get married. sir te warns governor yu that governing outer suburbs of beijing would be a difficult task and advises him to keep connects with the local mafia.\none evening, a masked thief sneaks into sir te's estate and steals the green destiny. sir te's servant master bo (gao xi'an) and shu lien trace the theft to governor yu's compound, where jade fox had been posing as jen's governess for many years. this fact is not known to bo or shu lien. jade fox keeps an eye on both and is concerned as jen yu gets close to shu lien. soon after, mu bai arrives in beijing and discusses the theft with shu lien. master bo makes the acquaintance of inspector tsai (wang deming), a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter may (li li), who have come to beijing in pursuit of jade fox, whom they know is living with the yus. jade fox had killed his wife, and hence is out for revenge. he cant just arrest her and hence must lure her out of the yu compound. fox challenges the pair and master bo to a showdown that night. following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when mu bai arrives and outmaneuvers fox. she reveals that she killed mu bai's teacher because he slept with her but refused to take a woman as a pupil (so she stole the master's secret manual), and she felt it poetic justice for him to die at a woman's hand. just as mu bai is about to kill her, the masked thief reappears and helps fox. fox kills tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be jen).\nmu bai and shu lien are sure that fox is hiding in the yu house, but this will ruin yu's career and hence the situation has to be tackled delicately. mu bai tracks the masked thief and offers his help as her master, which she rejects. after seeing jen fight mu bai, fox realizes jen had been secretly studying the wudang manual. fox is illiterate and could only follow the diagrams, whereas jen's ability to read the manual allowed her to surpass her mentor in martial arts. fox is livid that jen yu stealing the sword put the spotlight on fox, and jen yu is livid at fox for killing a policeman. at night, a desert bandit named lo (chang chen) breaks into jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. a flashback reveals that in the past, when governor yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, lo and his bandits had raided jen's caravan and lo had stolen her comb. she pursued him to his desert cave to get her comb back. however, the pair soon fell passionately in love. lo eventually convinced jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. lo came to beijing to persuade jen not to go through with her arranged marriage. however, jen refuses to leave with him. later, lo interrupts jen's wedding procession, begging her to leave with him. nearby, shu lien and mu bai convince lo to wait for jen at mount wudang, where he will be safe from jen's family, who are furious with him. jen runs away from her husband on their wedding night before the marriage could be consummated. disguised in male clothing, she is accosted at an inn by a large group of warriors; armed with the green destiny and her own superior combat skills, she emerges victorious. jen visits shu lien, who tells her that lo is waiting for her at mount wudang. after an angry exchange (jen thinks, shu lien is trying to set her up and return her to her husband, while shu lien said she has done nothing but protect her family since the first day, as she knew jen had stolen the sword), the two women engage in a duel. shu lien is the superior fighter, but jen wields the green destiny: the sword destroys each weapon that shu lien wields, until shu lien finally manages to defeat jen with a broken sword. when shu lien shows mercy, jen wounds shu lien in the arm. mu bai arrives and pursues jen into a bamboo forest. mu bai confronts jen and offers to take her as his student. she arrogantly promises to accept him as her teacher if he can take green destiny from her in three moves. mu bai is able to take the sword in only one move, but jen goes back on her word to accept him as teacher. mu bai throws the sword over a waterfall, jen dives after it, and is then rescued by fox. fox puts jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern; mu bai and shu lien discover her there. fox suddenly reappears and attacks the others with poisoned darts. mu bai blocks the needles with his sword and avenges his master's death by mortally wounding fox, only to realize that one of the darts hit him in the neck. fox dies, confessing that her goal had been to kill jen because jen had hidden the secrets of wudang's best fighting techniques from her. as jen leaves to prepare an antidote for the poisoned dart (jade had taught it to her), mu bai prepares to die. with his last breaths, he finally confesses his love for shu lien. he dies in her arms as jen returns, too late to save him. the green destiny is returned to sir te. jen later goes to mount wudang and spends one last night with lo. the next morning, lo finds jen standing on a bridge overlooking the edge of the mountain. in an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. he wishes for them to be together again, back in the desert, and jen jumps off the bridge to fly among white clouds."

    "overview": "in 1984 east berlin, an agent of the secret police conducting surveillance on a writer and his lover finds himself becoming increasingly absorbed by their lives.",
    "synopsis": "In 1984 East Berlin, Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler assigns himself to monitor playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover Christa-Maria. He bugs their apartment, quietly observes, and gradually shifts from cold enforcer to empathic spectator. As minister Hempf pushes for tighter surveillance to eliminate Dreyman, Wiesler’s covert operations escalate into protecting the couple: he stays the execution of 'Lazlo' surveillance at first, but suppresses critical discoveries, and even hints at temptations to save them. Dreyman’s circle grows suspicious of eavesdropping; he plans a West German publication exposing East German suicides and state censorship. Wiesler’s restraint wavers as he witnesses personal bonds, art, and love under oppression, culminating in Christa-Maria’s coerced collaboration with the regime, her death after assisting Dreyman’s escape route. The article is published; Dreyman becomes a suspect, and Hempf weaponizes the affair to purge them. Wiesler faces a moral choice: reveal himself and aid the couple, or protect the system and his career. He ultimately opts to shield Dreyman and Christa-Maria, securing the missing typewriter, but Christa-Maria dies in a truck accident while the authorities close in. The regime collapses years later; Dreyman uncovers the Lazlo files, revealing Wieselr’s hidden role and the archive’s gaps. Dreyman discovers a dedication in a novel—“To hgw xx/7”—and realizes Wiesler’s sacrifice cost him everything, including anonymity. The final scene finds Wiesler working anonymously in a basement as the wall falls, while Dreyman’s memory and the truth of the surveillance remain within the Stasi’s long shadows.",

      "the lives of others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. the film opens in east berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the stasi, or secret police. stasi captain gerd wiesler ( ulrich mühe ), code name hgw xx/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. a student asks a question that wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \"bourgeois\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. during the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director florian henckel von donnersmarck draws a portrait of wiesler that borders on caricature: wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. he is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \"the system,\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better socialist society. at the end of the class, lieutenant-colonel anton grubitz ( ulrich tukur ), wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the culture department at stasi, comes to invite wiesler to a theatrical premiere. the play is by the celebrated east german playwright georg dreyman ( sebastian koch ), and its leading character is played by dreyman's lover, christa-maria sieland ( martina gedeck ), an actress of great reputation. dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush east berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among ddr officials who value him because he's one of the few east german writers whose work is read in the west. he preserves the respect of the artistic community by using his (relatively) secure position for occasional interventions in favor of dissident fellow artists. wiesler at once suspects that dreyman's loyalty to the party is not as strong as it would seem on the surface, even if the high party officials are convinced. following the performance grubitz has a brief conversation regarding dreyman with culture minister bruno hempf ( thomas thieme ), who also attended. hempf is attracted to the leading lady. however, since dreyman is in the way, he must somehow be eliminated. hempf, who happens also to be a member of the zk (\"zentralkomitee\") which has authority over the stasi, tells grubitz about his reservations regarding the playwright's loyalty to the sed (\"sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands,\" or socialist unity party), suggesting full-scale surveillance of dreyman. grubitz, always eager to better his own political future, asks his friend wiesler to manage this procedure (the highest level of monitoring of suspected individuals), code-named \"lazlo.\" (laszlo is a hungarian name -- perhaps a reference to the high suicide rates in hungary, which we'll touch on later.) soon after, hempf meets dreyman and sieland at a party, and in a rather unsubtle way lets christa-maria know of his feelings toward her. he also tweaks dreyman about the naiveté of the belief displayed in his plays that people change; hempf is convinced that people never change. wiesler stalks dreyman, noting his comings and goings, and while the playwright is away he has dreyman's apartment systematically bugged. as the bugging team leaves the apartment, wiesler notices that a neighbor is watching them through the peephole in her door. he knocks and tells the neighbor that if she tells anyone what she saw, her daughter will lose her place at university. wiesler sets up his surveillance headquarters in the attic, just above the apartment. as dreyman and sieland prepare for a party in the flat in honor of dreyman's fortieth birthday, sieland presents him with a necktie and reminds him that he promised to wear it. she wonders if he knows how to tie it, and he replies that he's from the middle class and grew up wearing ties; he's since had to transcend his background (presumably to succeed in a socialist state). when he goes into the hall to put on the tie, though, it becomes clear that he was not telling the truth, and he makes a mess of it. he nips across the landing to knock on his neighbor's door and ask her to tie it for him. she comes into his apartment and ties the tie competently, but she's so nervous (about the surveillance) that dreyman asks whether she's sick -- but of course she can't tell him what's the matter. the neighbor goes home with christa-maria none the wiser; she's mildly impressed at dreyman's unexpected skill with a necktie. at the party dreyman's close friend, theater director albert jerska ( volkmar kleinert ), is shunned by the other guests. because jerska has been blacklisted for his anti-government opinions he hasn't been able to work for years; now people are afraid to be seen talking to him. jerska's birthday gift to dreyman is sheet music for a work called sonata for a good man. in a lunchtime scene at stasi headquarters, a young agent starts to tell a joke about sed leader erich honecker. he's overheard and forced to finish it by grubitz, who then threatens to have him transferred to the most low-level, soul-crushingly boring job available, and finally claims he was kidding. soon wiesler's observations indicate that, contrary to his prejudices toward artists as free-thinkers, dreyman's attitude toward the ddr and its sed is not particularly scornful. in the meantime, christa-maria has been \"convinced\" by minister hempf to be receptive to his advances, and when wiesler finds out about this development, it dawns on him that maybe operation lazlo has more to do with the libido of the minister than with the ddr's security. from his surveillance post, wiesler makes dreyman's doorbell ring to draw dreyman down to the street door in time to see the minister drop sieland off and tell her when she must meet him again. dreyman is provoked to take action by the awareness of his lover's coerced sexual relationship with the minister and the suicide of his blacklisted friend jerska. after learning of jerska's death, dreyman sits at his piano and plays the piece jerska gave him, the sonata for a good man. wiesler, listening in the attic, is moved to tears by the music. christa-maria comes in and dreyman quotes lenin saying if he'd kept listening to beethoven's appassionata he'd never have finished the revolution. then he asks, \"can anyone who has heard this music, i mean truly heard it, really be a bad person?\" in the following scene, a small child in an elevator asks wiesler if he's really with the stasi, and confides that his father says stasi agents are bad men who put people in prison. wiesler starts to ask the boy his father's name, but stops himself. the film showcases wiesler's empty life -- he apparently has no family -- in an episode with a prostitute. after sex he asks her to stay a little while, but she has another appointment. saying that he needs to reserve any time he wants in advance, she leaves him alone. dreyman resolves to help reveal the true face of the ddr government to the outside world. with the help of well-positioned west germans who provide him with a typewriter that can't be traced back to him, he plans to publish an anonymous exposé in one of the leading west german weeklies, der spiegel. the article concerns the ddr government's cover-up of the high suicide rate in east germany; the government stopped collecting suicide statistics in 1977, at which time east germany's suicide rate was higher than that of every other country in europe except for hungary. as they work on the article, dreyman's friends worry about being overheard. dreyman is sure his apartment isn't bugged, but his friends suspect otherwise. they devise a test: a contact in west germany comes to visit dreyman's flat and they discuss his plans to return to west germany with his son, an east german citizen, hidden under the seat of his car. they describe the car, a gold mercedes, and the intended route, then announce their departure. wiesler hears everything but decides not to tip off the border guards. when the car makes it across the border, dreyman and his friends conclude that his apartment is safe and unbugged. wiesler has heard enough by now to know that dreyman is writing something that will be smuggled out for publication in west germany; he's in a position to provide a victory to the ddr and a feather in his own professional cap by foiling dreyman's plot. however, wiesler is starting to waver in his determination to bring operation lazlo to its conclusion. in the process of snooping in his victims' everyday lives, including their love lives, he has unconsciously been drawn into their world, which in turn has put his own in question. at one point, he approaches a despondent christa-maria in a café to tell her how much he admires her work. she replies that he's a good man. he does not tell her his name. when wiesler returns to the surveillance post, he learns that christa-maria went home to dreyman, skipping her appointment with the minister, and that she won't see the minister again. when dreyman's article is finally published in the west, it is a public disaster for the ddr, and the playwright becomes a prime suspect. grubitz is incredulous that with all his expertise, wiesler could have missed the indications that dreyman was writing the article. (wiesler, like dreyman, has relied on dreyman's cover story that he's writing a play in honor of the ddr's 40th anniversary.) minister hempf uses christa-maria's drug addiction as an excuse to have her arrested and threatens to terminate her acting career unless she collaborates with the authorities and denounces her lover as the author of the embarrassing article, which she does. the stasi searches dreyman's apartment, but comes up empty-handed. now wiesler, who had withheld evidence concerning the source of the article, must decide where his allegiances lie: with the ddr and his brilliant career as a top stasi officer, or with dreyman and christa-maria, whose honest lives he has come to appreciate. in a tense scene, he sits in an interrogation room as christa-maria is brought in, knowing that she will recognize him from their encounter at the café and that grubitz is watching through the one-way glass. but sieland is too good an actress to give anything away. wiesler offers her a choice: never work in the theater again, or become an informant and tell him where dreyman has hidden the typewriter he used to write the suicide article. he tells her that they already have enough evidence to put dreyman in jail, so there's nothing she can do for him, but she can save herself and hide her involvement with the stasi. she agrees, miserably. wiesler rushes to reach dreyman's apartment before the rest of the stasi search team. he extracts the typewriter from its hiding-place and spirits it away. a newly released christa-maria comes home and feeds dreyman a line about being away in the country; she's in the shower when the stasi team arrives and she emerges in her bathrobe in time to see grubitz start to pry up the floorboard that still, she believes, conceals the typewriter. she makes bleak eye contact with dreyman, who knows she must have told them where to look. she leaves the house before grubitz can get the board up to reveal -- nothing. when she reaches the street, christa-maria steps deliberately into the path of a truck and is hit. wiesler speaks to her briefly as she lies bleeding in the road, but retreats as dreyman embraces her and apologizes; he believes she removed the typewriter. she dies. grubitz, who seems slightly abashed by this development, calls off the investigation. however, he tells wiesler that although wiesler was clever enough to leave no tracks, grubitz knows he covered for dreyman. grubitz assures wiesler that he will spend the remaining 20 years of his career steaming open the correspondence of his fellow citizens in a dank stasi basement. about five years later wiesler is, indeed, steaming letters open in a basement office; a colleague behind him is listening to the radio. (it's the same young officer who got in trouble for telling a joke about sed leader erich honecker -- demoted despite grubnitz's assurance that he was kidding about punishing him.) the young officer hears on the radio that the berlin wall has fallen and shares his earpiece so wiesler can listen too. when wiesler gets up and walks out of the stasi office, the other workers follow him. two years later, dreyman runs into ex-minister hempf (who has survived the political upheaval very well, thank you), and asks him why his (dreyman's) apartment was never bugged. hempf (before throwing in a spurious insult about dreyman's inability to sexually satisfy christa-maria) assures dreyman that his home was thoroughly bugged, tells him about operation lazlo, and advises him to look behind his light switches. dreyman does so, and then visits the stasi archives, which have been made public. in the lengthy records of operation lazlo, he discovers gaps covering evidence that would have been damning, along with beneficial misinformation, all attributed to a stasi agent identified as hgw xx/7. he also learns that christa-maria was released from custody too late to have extracted the typewriter from its hiding place, and he notices a red fingerprint on one of the pages -- left there by an agent who must have handled the mysteriously missing typewriter with its distinctive red ribbon. the file's final entry notes the transfer and demotion of hgw xx/7, who is blamed for the failure of the operation. dreyman looks up hgw xx/7's real name and tracks down wiesler (who now delivers mail for a living), but doesn't speak to him. two year later still, wiesler walks past a bookstore advertising a new release with huge posters of the author's face. the book, billed as a novel, is called sonata for a good man, and the author is georg dreyman. wiesler goes inside, opens a copy, and reads the dedication: to hgw xx/7, in gratitude. at the checkout counter the clerk asks whether he should giftwrap the book, and wiesler replies, \"no, it's for me.\""

    "overview": "after he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat hires a young man from the projects to be his caregiver.",
    "synopsis": "Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic in a Paris mansion, hires Driss, a young ex-con from the banlieues, as his live‑in caregiver. Though initial motives differ, their arrangement becomes a genuine partnership as Driss cares for Philippe through phantom pains, daily routines, and a shift in lifestyle. Driss unlocks Philippe’s social world and personal ambitions: he broadens Philippe’s experiences, introduces him to modern art, opera, and even a private painting sale that funds Driss’s family. Philippe reveals the accident that left him disabled and his late wife; Driss, in turn, shares his background, family pressures, and desire to uplift his cousin Adama. Through humor, blunt honesty, and mutual respect, they navigate class divides, independence, and dignity. Driss encourages Philippe to pursue Eleonore, a long‑distance partner, and the two test life beyond the mansion: a birthday concert, a private jet weekend, and a move toward openness. After emotional moments, Philippe contemplates Eleonore’s reaction to his disability; a failed meeting prompts a weekend trip to the coast, where a public display of affection and a quiet, supportive goodbye seal their bond. In the end, Driss returns to his community wiser and with a new job, while Philippe finds renewed purpose in his relationships and personal conduct, aided by a growing circle of carers who replace Driss but cannot replace the impact of their friendship.",

philippe pretends to have a stroke and the fooled police officers eventually escort them to the hospital. as the police leave them at the hospital, philippe asks what will they do now, to which driss answers: \"now let me take care of it.\" as they drive off. the story of the two men is then told as a flashback, which takes up almost the rest of the film. philippe, a rich quadriplegic who owns a luxurious parisian mansion, and his assistant magalie, are interviewing candidates to be his live-in carer. driss, a candidate, has no ambitions to get hired. he is just there to get a signature showing he was interviewed and rejected in order to continue to receive his welfare benefits. he is extremely casual and shamelessly flirts with magalie. he is told to come back the next morning to get his signed letter. driss goes back to the tiny flat that he shares with his extended family in a bleak parisian suburb. his aunt, exasperated from not hearing from him for six months, orders him to leave the flat. the next day, driss returns to philippe's mansion and learns to his surprise that he is on a trial period for the live-in carer job. he learns the extent of philippe's disability and then accompanies philippe in every moment of his life, discovering with astonishment a completely different lifestyle. a friend of philippe's reveals driss's criminal record which includes six months in jail for robbery. philippe states he does not care about driss's past because he is the only one that does not treat him with pity or compassion, but as an equal. he says he will not fire him as long as he does his current job properly. over time, driss and philippe become closer. driss dutifully takes care of his boss, who frequently suffers from phantom pain. philippe discloses to driss that he became disabled following a paragliding accident and that his wife died without bearing children. gradually, philippe is led by driss to put some order in his private life, including being more strict with his adopted daughter elisa, who behaves like a spoiled child with the staff. driss discovers modern art, both traditional and modern, and opera, and even takes up painting. for philippe's birthday, a private concert of classical music is performed in his living room. at first very reluctant, driss is led by philippe to listen more carefully to the music and opens up to philippe's music. driss then plays the music he likes to philippe (boogie wonderland, by earth, wind & fire), which opens up everybody in the room to dance. driss discovers that philippe has a purely epistolary relationship with a woman called eleonore, who lives in dunkirk. driss encourages him to meet her but philippe fears her reaction when she discovers his disability. driss eventually convinces philippe to talk to eleonore on the phone. philippe agrees with driss to send a photo of him in a wheelchair to her, but he hesitates and asks his aide, yvonne, to send a picture of him as he was before his accident. a date between eleonore and philippe is agreed. at the last minute philippe is too scared to meet eleonore and leaves with yvonne before eleonore arrives. philippe then calls driss and invites him to travel with him in his private jet for a paragliding weekend. philippe gives driss an envelope containing 11,000 euros, the amount he was able to get for driss's painting, which he sold to one of his friends by saying it was from an up-and-coming artist. adama, driss's younger cousin, who is in trouble with a gang, takes refuge in philippe's mansion. driss opens up to philippe about his family and his past as an orphan in senegal, who was adopted by his then-childless aunt and uncle and brought back to france. his adoptive parents later began having children of their own, his uncle died and his aunt bore still more children. philippe recognizes driss's need to support his family and releases him from his job, suggesting he \"may not want to push a wheelchair all his life\". driss returns to his suburbs, joining his friends, and manages to help his younger cousin. due to his new professional experience, he lands a job in a transport company. in the meantime philippe has hired carers to replace driss, but he isn't happy with any of them. his morale is very low and he stops taking care of himself. yvonne becomes worried and contacts driss, who arrives and decides to drive philippe in the maserati, which brings the story back to the first scene of the film, the police chase. after they have eluded the police, driss takes philippe straight to the seaside. upon shaving and dressing elegantly, philippe and driss arrive at a cabourg restaurant with a great ocean view. driss suddenly leaves the table and says good luck to philippe for his lunch date. philippe does not understand, but a few seconds later, eleonore arrives. emotionally touched, philippe looks through the window and sees driss outside, smiling at him. the film ends with driss bidding philippe farewell and walking away."

Danny, gifted with shining, senses hotel malevolence and hallucinates forebodings. Hallorann confirms Danny’s telepathic link; room 237 is off-limits. As winter deepens, Jack’s sanity frays under the hotel’s influences; he experiences visions, memories of past violence, and commands to harm. Wendy suspects Jack as Danny’s visions escalate; Danny’s “redrum” warning appears. Jack’s paranoia grows; he confronts Grady’s ghostly presence and a party in the gold room, then descends into rage. Wendy protects Danny, discovers Jack’s manuscript of “all work and no play,” and locks Jack in the pantry after a brutal assault. Jack sabotages communications and the snowcat, trapping the family. In a culminating sequence, Jack pursues Wendy and Danny within the hotel; Danny escapes through a hedge maze, retraces footprints, and ultimately leads Wendy to safety as Jack dies freezing in the maze. Danny’s survival ends the immediate threat, while the hotel’s haunted history remains, hinted by photographs and echoes from the past.",

      "former teacher and recovering alcoholic jack torrance ( jack nicholson ) interviews for a caretaker job at the overlook hotel in an effort to rebuild his life after his volatile temper lost him his teaching position. the hotel manager, mr. stuart ullman ( barry nelson ), warns jack that he and his family will be snowbound through most of the winter and of the potential risk for cabin fever. he drives the point home by recounting a season when the caretaker, charles grady, went crazy and brutaly killed his wife, his two girls ( lisa burns and louise burns ), and finally himself. given his own desperation and the opportunity to pursue his true passion, writing, jack acknowledges the warning, but accepts the job. meanwhile, jack's son danny ( danny lloyd ) has a seizure while talking to his imaginary friend tony about the overlook hotel. he has a vision of blood splashing out of an elevator in the hotel, an image which is revisited several times throughout the film. upon danny's arrival at the hotel, head chef dick hallorann ( scatman crothers ) recognizes that danny is telepathic, and speaks to him mentally to offer him some ice cream. he explains that he and his grandmother both had the gift; she referred to this communication as \"shining.\" he also counsels danny about the hotel, hinting that something terrible had happened there and left a trace, \"as if someone burned toast,\" which only people who can \"shine\" will perceive. danny questions dick about what went on in the hotel, and about room 237 in particular as danny can sense that dick is especially afraid of that room. though he strives to assure danny that the images he sees in the hotel are just \"like pictures in a book\" and can't hurt him, dick sternly warns danny to stay out of that room. jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly once the family is alone in the hotel. he has writer's block, sleeps too little, and is irritable. danny has visions of the two murdered grady girls, but tells no one. he continues to wonder about room 237. while the weather is still relatively warm, jack's wife wendy ( shelley duvall ) and danny walk through a maze of tall hedges, making a game out of it, stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes. one day, a ball rolls toward danny as he plays with his toys. it appears to have come from the open door of room 237, which danny enters. at that moment, wendy comes running from the basement at the sound of jack's screams in the lounge. he tells her that he had a nightmare in which he used an axe to chop danny and her to pieces. as a disconcerted wendy promises that \"everything's gonna be okay,\" danny appears at the other end of the room, looking disoriented and sucking his thumb. his sweater is ripped and there are bruises on his neck. he does not answer when wendy asks what happened. she angrily accuses jack of hurting danny and takes the child back to their suite. jack is furious about the accusation. he storms around the hotel, making his way to the gold ballroom. sinking defeatedly onto a stool at an empty bar, his head in his hands, jack declares that he would sell his soul for one drink. when he looks up he discovers a bartender ( joe turkel ), who serves him a drink. jack is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of the bartender and even addresses him by his name, lloyd. in the course of telling his troubles to lloyd, jack reveals that he unintentionally dislocated danny's shoulder, the same accident wendy mentioned to danny's pediatrician earlier. notably, jack states that the injury happened three years ago, while in explaining the same story to the pediatrician, wendy said that jack, who vowed to quit drinking immediately following the accident, has currently been sober for only five months. a frantic wendy enters, finding jack seemingly alone at the bar; she pleads with him to investigate danny's claim that \"a crazy woman\" attacked him in the bathtub of room 237. jack, who acts a bit tipsy, grudgingly agrees to go have a look. as jack approaches the door to room 237, danny appears to be having a seizure in his own room. dick, back at his home in florida, stares wide-eyed as he picks up on a signal danny is sending. jack cautiously enters room 237. the bedroom is empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. he watches lustfully as a young, beautiful, naked woman ( lia beldam ) pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly out of the bathtub. the two approach each other and embrace in a passionate kiss. jack catches a glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse. he recoils in horror-- the young lady standing before him has transformed into an elderly woman ( billie gibson ); a walking corpse with rotten, sagging skin. she cackles madly while reaching for him with outstretched arms. stunned, jack staggers out of the room, locking the door after him. when he reports back to wendy, jack denies anything amiss in room 237. wendy suggests they take danny to a doctor. jack becomes irate, lecturing wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming her for everything that's gone wrong in his life. insisting that they can't leave the hotel because of his obligation to his employers, he storms out, returning to the gold room, which is now the scene of an extravagant party with guests dressed in 1920's fashion. lloyd serves him a drink and jack strolls through the crowd. he doesn't get far when a butler carrying a tray runs into him, spilling advocaat on his jacket. the butler convinces jack to come into the bathroom to clean up. the butler introduces himself as delbert grady ( philip stone ). jack remembers the story mr. ullman told him about a former caretaker named grady murdering his family and confronts grady with the information. grady denies that anything of the sort took place and furthermore insists that jack has \"always been the caretaker.\" jack is confused, but seems to accept grady's story. grady goes on to tell jack that danny has \"a great talent\" and is using it to bring an \"outside party\" into the situation, referring to dick halloran with a racial slur. grady advises jack on how to \"correct\" danny, and how to deal with wendy if she interferes. back in florida, dick has had no luck contacting the people at the overlook hotel. worried about danny, he books the next flight to colorado. at the overlook, wendy arms herself with a baseball bat and looks for jack, intent on leaving the hotel with danny whether or not jack agrees to come. entering the lounge, she spots jack's manuscript left unattended next to the typewriter. she reads what jack has been writing: hundreds of pages of repetitions of a single sentence: \"all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.\" she realizes that jack has gone mad. jack approaches from behind and asks sarcastically, \"how do you like it?\" wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face him. a confrontation ensues as jack demands to know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel with danny, while wendy retreats, brandishing the bat. she screams at jack not to hurt her, and he swears that he will not; instead, he intends to kill her. wendy hits jack on the head with the bat at the top of a flight of stairs, causing him to lose his balance and tumble down the staircase, injuring his ankle in the process. wendy drags jack's limp body to the pantry and locks him inside, just as he regains consciousness. jack tells her he has sabotaged the radio, as well as the snow cat, stranding them all there. she goes outside to check on the snow cat, and confirms what he told her. a few hours later, jack is roused from a nap by the sound of delbert grady's voice. grady expresses disappointment and a lack of confidence in jack, but jack assures him he can get the job done if given one more chance. the pantry door then suddenly unlocks. wendy has fallen asleep in her room. danny is in a trance, carrying a knife and muttering \"redrum\" repeatedly. he takes wendy's lipstick and writes \"redrum\" on the bathroom door. he begins shouting \"redrum,\" which wakes wendy. she clutches him to her, then sees the reflection of the bathroom door in the mirror. reversed, it reads: \"murder.\" at that instant, banging sounds start coming from the door to the hallway. the sound is jack swinging an axe at the locked door. wendy grabs danny and locks them in the bathroom. she opens a tiny, snow banked window and pushes danny out; he slides safely to the ground. she tries to get out the same window, but cannot fit. she tells danny to run and hide. meanwhile, jack has chopped his way through the front door and calls out \"wendy, i'm home!\" jack then knocks politely on the bathroom door. wendy holds the knife and tries to steady herself as jack begins chopping into the door. after chopping away one of the panels, he sticks his head through and screams \"heeeere's johnny!\" (a reference to the tonight show starring johnny carson (1962) ). jack sticks his hand through the door to turn the lock. wendy slashes at him with a knife, cutting jack's hand and sending him recoiling in pain. jack continues to hack at the door with the axe until they both hear the low rumble of an approaching snow cat engine. he stalks out. the snow cat driver is dick. inside the hotel, he calls out, but gets no reply. jack, hiding behind a pillar, leaps out and swings the axe into dick's chest, killing him. danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet, screams, revealing his location. he clambers out of the steel cabinet and runs outside. meanwhile, wendy has ventured from the bathroom and begun to search for danny. the hotel has sprung to life and now even wendy encounters its ghosts, sights that shock and horrify her. at the same time, axe-wielding jack turns on the outdoor lights and follows danny into the hedge maze. danny realizes he is leaving a trail of footprints in the snow for jack to follow. he carefully retraces his steps, walking backwards in the same prints he'd just created in the opposite direction, then covers the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge. when jack arrives, he sees that the trail of footprints ends abruptly, giving him no clue as to which direction danny took. he chooses a path and lurches deeper into the maze. danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows his own footprints back to the maze's entrance. wendy makes her way out of the hotel just as danny emerges from the maze. relieved, she flings down the knife and embraces him. jack bellows his frustration from within the maze. danny and wendy waste no time escaping in the snow cat that dick used to get to the hotel. jack, hopelessly lost in the maze, freezes to death. right before the end credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old photographs that chronicle the hotel's history. an old recording of \"midnight, the stars and you\" echoes in the empty hallway. in the center of one picture is a young jack. the caption reads, \"overlook hotel, july 4th ball, 1921.\""

      "after landing a job as an off-season caretaker, jack torrance, an aspiring author and recovering alcoholic, drags his wife wendy and gifted son danny to snow-covered colorado's secluded overlook hotel. however, writer's block prevents jack from pursuing a new writing career. everything has its time, however. first, the manager must give jack a grand tour. then, mr hallorann, the facility's aging chef, chats with danny about rare psychic gifts. the mysterious employee also warns the boy about the cavernous hotel's abandoned rooms. room 237, especially, is off-limits. that's all very well, but jack is gradually losing his mind. after all, strange occurrences and blood-chilling visions have trapped the family in a silent gargantuan prison hammered by endless snowstorms. and now, incessant voices inside jack's head demand sacrifice. however, is jack capable of murder?",
      "built in 1907, the posh, grand and secluded overlook hotel, located in the mountains of colorado, closes for the winter months as it was never designed as a ski resort, that seclusion and isolation which has always been its attraction for its upscale guests and which makes it largely inaccessible in the snowy winter. having recently moved from vermont to boulder with his wife wendy and their adolescent son danny, former schoolteacher jack torrance has just accepted the five month job as the overlook's winter caretaker in wanting uninterrupted solitude to start his new career as a writer. in accepting the job, jack was not deterred in knowing of the incident ten years ago when the then hotel gm charles grady, acting as that season's winter caretaker, developed a severe case of cabin fever and ended up gruesomely killing his wife and two daughters before killing himself. beyond a recent undiagnosed collapse experienced by danny which may be an issue if it happens again at the hotel, wendy is looking forward to this five month getaway. while danny indirectly states he doesn't want to go, wendy is not concerned about his emotional well being in this new situation as he, out of circumstance, has often been on his own without other children around, which has long ago led to him creating an imaginary friend named tony who lives in danny's mouth. when the torrances arrive at the overlook on october 30th, its last day of operation before they take over for the winter, danny learns that there is someone at the hotel who knows his secret abilities in association to tony's true nature. after the regular staff leaves for the winter and as winter truly sets in, the isolation of the resort begins to show itself. the question becomes which of the often battling powers in this isolation will ultimately come out on top: wendy's mortal fortitude, danny's secret ability which he learns is called the shining, or the hotel's associated secrets which are slowly overtaking jack.",
      "the wannabe writer jack torrance travels to the overlook hotel to be interviewed by the manager stuart ullman about a job position. jack is a candidate to work as caretaker of the hotel over the winter, and ullman warns him about the cabin fever since his family will be isolated for five months. ten years ago, the caretaker charles grady murdered his wife, his two daughters and himself with an ax affected by the isolation. on the day the hotel is closed, jack arrives with his wife wendy torrance and son danny and while ullman shows the hotel to jack and wendy, the chief of the kitchen dick hallorann entertains danny. he explains to danny that they are shining, meaning they have premonition and telepathic abilities. during the winter, danny sees weird events at the hotel and jack works hard on his novel. until the day danny is wounded by a woman in room 237 that tries to strangle him and wendy discovers that jack is insane.",
      "jack torrance becomes caretaker of the isolated overlook hotel during winter, bringing his family. the hotel's supernatural forces exploit jack's mental instability, leading to violence and terror. son danny possesses psychic \"shining\" abilities, sensing the hotel's malevolence. the film blends horror, psychological drama, and suspense, exploring isolation, madness, family dynamics, and the destructive potential of unaddressed trauma."
