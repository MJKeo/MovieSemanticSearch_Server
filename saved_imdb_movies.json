    "synopsis": [
      "high school senior ferris bueller (matthew broderick) decides to skip school on a spring day by faking an illness for his parents (lyman ward and cindy pickett), then encourages his girlfriend, sloane (mia sara), and his pessimistic best friend cameron (alan ruck) to spend the day in chicago as one of their last flings before they graduate and head off to different colleges. he sets up an elaborate ruse in his bedroom with a mannequin, a trophy and his stereo in case anyone decides to check on him. ferris persuades cameron to let them use his father's restored 1961 ferrari 250 gt \"california\" to pick up sloane (as part of their cover) to travel into the city. he also has cameron impersonate sloane's stuffy-toned father to have sloane excused for the day due to a faked death in the family. the rest of the school and many residents learn of ferris' exaggerated illness and offer donations to help \"save ferris\". however, only two people are not convinced by ferris' deception: his sister, jeanie (jennifer grey), outraged at ferris' ability to defy authority easily, and the school's dean of students, edward rooney (jeffrey jones), believing ferris to be truant. ferris and his friends arrive downtown and leave the ferrari with two garage attendants (richard edson and larry jenkins), who drive off in it a short while later to take a joyride. ferris, sloane, and cameron enjoy the sights, including taking in a cubs game at wrigley field, visiting the sears tower, the art institute of chicago, the chicago mercantile exchange, and taking part in the von steuben day parade, with ferris lip-syncing to wayne newton's \"danke schoen\" and the beatles' version of \"twist and shout\", dedicating the former to cameron himself. ferris also uses his ploys to pretend he is abe froeman, the sausage king of chicago, to dine at an upscale restaurant on rush street (while narrowly avoiding his own father who is dining out with some business associates). meanwhile, mr. rooney has gone off-campus to try to find ferris, first at a local hangout, then to ferris' home, where mr. rooney attempts to gain entry, but ends up getting stuck in the mud and losing his shoe and wallet while being chased by the dog. jeanie comes home to look for ferris, instead discovering mr. rooney, whom she mistakes for a burglar, kicking him several times in the face and retreating. she calls the police, forcing mr. rooney to flee the scene. when the police show up, they haul jeanie in for prank calling, and at the police station, she talks to a drug dealer (charlie sheen), who tells her that she needs to stop obsessing about her brother and focus on herself. jeanie's mother shows up to collect her, upset at having to do so, and finds jeanie making out with the boy. at the end of the day, ferris and his friends retrieve the ferrari, but discover on the way home that hundreds of miles have been added to the odometer, sending cameron into a panic fearing his abusive father's reaction. after calming cameron down, ferris comes up with a plan to run the car in reverse, in place, with its rear wheels jacked up, at cameron's father's hillside garage, hoping to reverse the odometer. when they realize this is not working, cameron unleashes his pent-up anger against his father, yelling about how his father loves the car more than his own son and damaging the front of the car, but comes to realize he is long due to stand up to his father, and vows to accept the consequences. cameron calms down and rests himself against the car, but his previous actions have unbalanced it from the jack it was on, the car hits the ground, races in reverse, and crashes through a glass wall, landing in a ravine. despite ferris' offer to take the blame, cameron still plans to admit his actions to his father and take the consequences. ferris walks sloane home, then quickly races through the backyards of his neighborhood. while running across a street, he's nearly hit by a car: it is his sister and mother driving home. his mother doesn't spot him but jeanie does and she floors the gas pedal, trying to beat him home. ferris continues his race home. when he gets there, he finds mr. rooney waiting for him. however, jeanie, apparently having come to appreciate her brother's craftiness, has beaten him home despite her mother's demands and getting a ticket for speeding. she pretends to scold ferris for trying to walk home from the hospital while he is so ill, and thanks mr. rooney for driving him home, making sure to show mr. rooney the wallet he left behind when he broke in earlier. rooney is once again chased by the dog. ferris races to his room and makes it into bed just as his parents check on him. after they leave, he breaks the fourth wall and imparts some wisdom to his audience: \"life moves pretty fast. if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" as the credits roll, mr. rooney in his disheveled state is forced to catch a ride back to school on a school bus. in the tag at the very end of the credits, ferris emerges from the bathroom, pleading to the audience directly, \"you're still here? it's over! go home! go!\" before he turns around and reenters the bathroom."

      "plot_summary": "Ferris Bueller, a popular Chicago-area high school senior, fakes illness at home by staging a mannequin in his bed and playing a recording so his parents (Tom and Katie Bueller) believe he's sick. He persuades his anxious best friend Cameron Frye and girlfriend Sloane Peterson to join him in skipping school. Ferris convinces Cameron to let them use Cameron's father's restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California; he also has Cameron impersonate Sloane's father over the phone to get her excused under the pretense of a family death. At school, Dean of Students Edward Rooney becomes convinced Ferris is playing hooky and begins an obsessive search for him. Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron drive into Chicago, leave the Ferrari at a garage where two attendants take it for a joyride, and spend the day visiting Wrigley Field, the Sears Tower, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and joining the Von Steuben Day parade—Ferris lip-syncs Wayne Newton's \"Danke Schoen\" and The Beatles' \"Twist and Shout.\" Ferris also poses as Abe Froeman to dine at a top Rush Street restaurant, nearly running into his father who is dining downtown. Meanwhile, Rooney tracks leads off campus, confronts a hangout, then goes to the Bueller house where he attempts to force entry, gets stuck in the yard mud and loses his shoe and wallet while being chased by the family dog. Jeanie Bueller, Ferris's resentful sister, returns home, mistakes Rooney for a burglar, assaults him and calls the police; she is later brought to the station where she briefly fraternizes with a drug dealer and is lectured by her mother. The garage attendants return the Ferrari with hundreds of extra miles on the odometer; Cameron panics about his father's reaction. At Cameron's house they attempt to reverse the mileage by running the car in place with the rear wheels jacked up; the plan fails, Cameron erupts at his father's apparent neglect, smashes the car's nose in a rage, then the car falls off the jack, races backward through the garage's glass wall and plunges into a ravine. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron decides to confess to his father and accept responsibility. Ferris walks Sloane home, then races across neighborhood backyards to get home before Rooney. Jeanie, having grown to admire Ferris's cunning, speeds home and arrives first; she presents Rooney's wallet to him and pretends to fuss over Ferris's illness, allowing Ferris to slip into bed just as his parents check on him. Parents leave satisfied; Ferris breaks the fourth wall to address the audience with his closing lines about enjoying life. In the end, Rooney, humiliated and disheveled, is forced to ride a school bus back to school, and Ferris admonishes the lingering audience to go home during the end credits.",

when he gets there, he finds mr. rooney waiting for him. however, jeanie, apparently having come to appreciate her brother's craftiness, has beaten him home despite her mother's demands and getting a ticket for speeding. she pretends to scold ferris for trying to walk home from the hospital while he is so ill, and thanks mr. rooney for driving him home, making sure to show mr. rooney the wallet he left behind when he broke in earlier. rooney is once again chased by the dog. ferris races to his room and makes it into bed just as his parents check on him. after they leave, he breaks the fourth wall and imparts some wisdom to his audience: \"life moves pretty fast. if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" as the credits roll, mr. rooney in his disheveled state is forced to catch a ride back to school on a school bus. in the tag at the very end of the credits, ferris emerges from the bathroom, pleading to the audience directly, \"you're still here? it's over! go home! go!\" before he turns around and reenters the bathroom."

    ],
    "synopsis": [
      "in the town of bunnyburrow, 9-year-old bunny, judy hopps (della saba) is performing in a school play. her theme explains that animals, once primitive and wild, have now evolved to where predators and prey can live side by side in harmony. the founding mammal city, zootopia, is hailed as a place where anyone can be anything. judy then announces that she wants to be a police officer.\na kid fox in the audience, gideon grey (phil johnston), sneers at the idea and even judy's parents, bonnie (bonnie hunt) and stu (don lake) tell her that there's never been a bunny officer. however, judy is willing to try against all odds. when judy sees gideon bullying some kids by taking their fair tickets, she boldly confronts him, but gideon responds by taunting judy's dreams and slashing her in the face. he leaves and, though she's hurt, judy shows her friends the tickets she got back and declares that she doesn't know when to quit. years later, judy hopps (ginnifer goodwin), a rabbit from rural bunnyburrow, fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban zootopia. judy is tiny compared to the other recruits and faces difficulties managing the obstacle courses run by the drill sergeant (fuschia!). but through sheer determination, and by using her wits, judy makes it to graduation as valedictorian. zootopia mayor lionheart (j.k. simmons) oversees the ceremony and assistant mayor bellwether (jenny slate), a sheep, formally congratulates judy as the first bunny police officer, saying it's a big day for all small animals. a few days after, judy, her parents, and many siblings head to the train station. stu convinces judy to take a can of fox repellent with her before she gets on the train to zootopia. judy listens to a hit by pop singer, gazelle (shakira), as she zooms through the diverse districts of the city, from the frozen tundra to the sultry rain-forest. she finds her apartment, a run-down single room with a rickety bed, paper-thin walls, and two noisy neighbors, bucky (byron howard) and pronk oryx-antlerson ( jared bush). despite being the police academy valedictorian, judy is relegated to parking duty by chief bogo (idris elba), who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. judy is disappointed but sets her standards high and uses her sharp ears to help her write 200 tickets before noon. on her first day at the zootopia police department / zpd, she is hustled by nick wilde (jason bateman) and finnick (tom lister jr.), a con artist duo of foxes. finnick acts as a child, who is desperate to get a jumbo pop on his birthday. nick is acting his father. they con judy into buying them a jumbo pop, which they later melt and refreeze into hundreds of mini pops which they sell to school kids, on which they make a healthy profit. the pop sticks, they sell to a rat construction site, selling it as red-wood. judy observes the whole operation and later confronts nick. nick doesn't deny that he's a hustler but provides judy with all the paperwork he needs to make his endeavors technically legal and humbles her by saying that the city is not a magical land where dreams come true and a meter maid can never be a real cop. the next day, judy abandons parking duty to arrest duke weaselton (alan tudyk), a thief who stole plant crocus bulbs. bogo reprimands her for abandoning her post (as the parking ticket officer). an otter named mrs. otterton (octavia spencer) enters bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. judy volunteers, and bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination.\nthe city's assistant mayor, ewe dawn bellwether (jenny slate) arrives at the station and otterton pleads her case to bellwether and says how judy volunteered to help her. bellwether praises judy for taking the assignment, bogo agrees but demands judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours. after determining nick was the last one to see otterton. on the last seen photo of emmit, judy notices that nick is eating a popsicle which looks exactly like what nick was selling the other day. judy blackmails nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion. he then takes them into the oasis to find emmitt's yoga instructor, an elephant named nangi (gita reddy), and judy is shocked to find the oasis is a haven for naturalists or nude animals. nangi has no memory of otterton, but yax unwittingly gives judy all the information she needs, including the plate number for the car otterton was picked up in the last time he was there. nick says he has a friend at the dmv who can help them run the plate number. there, judy is disheartened to see that the dmv is run solely by sloths. by the time they exit, it's nighttime. they track a limousine that picked up emmitt. they search it, finding polar bear fur, claw marks all over the back seat, and otterton's wallet. nick recognizes an insignia on a drinking glass and realizes that the vehicle is owned by mr. big (maurice lamarche), an arctic shrew crime boss whom nick has a history with. nick sold him an expensive rug made from the fur of a skunk's behind. mr big's henchmen capture nick and judy and bring them to big. big berates nick for tarnishing his trust and the hospitality of his grandmother who he recently buried in the skunk rug and scolds him for returning on the day of his daughter's wedding. mr. big orders his bears to 'ice' nick and judy and they're held over a trap door in the floor that reveals icy water. mr. big's daughter, fru fru (leah latham), then walks in wearing her wedding dress and recognizes judy as the bunny that saved her the previous day from being crushed by the doughnut.\nmr. big reveals that otterton was his florist, but he went \"savage\", reverted to a feral state, and attacked his chauffeur, manchas (jesse corti). at his home, manchas mentions that otterton had been yelling about \"night howlers.\" moments later, manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. judy saves nick by trapping manchas and calls the zpd for help. when bogo and other police arrive, however, manchas had vanished. bogo demands judy's resignation, but nick reminds bogo she still has 10 hours to solve the case.\nover the rain-forest, nick explains that he was idealistic like judy once. as a kid, he wanted nothing more than to join the junior ranger scouts. his mother bought him a new uniform and he was excited to become part of the group, despite the fact that he was the only predator to join. upon arriving, however, the other animals bullied and muzzled him, saying that he was stupid for thinking they'd trust a fox. after that day he decided he would never let anyone see that they had gotten to him and if people only thought of foxes as untrustworthy, then that's what he would be. deciding there was no use in fighting prejudiced ideas about fox behavior, he became a con artist. judy recalls that assistant mayor bellwether offered to help them. bellwether gives judy and nick access to the city's traffic-camera system. they discover manchas was captured by wolves, which judy surmises are the \"night howlers\". they watch as the wolves' van drives through a tunnel but fails to come out the other side. nick says that there's a maintenance tunnel and, if he were to do anything illegal, that's the route he'd take to avoid observation. they find otterton and the other missing predators imprisoned at cliffside asylum, where mayor leodore lionheart (j. k. simmons) is keeping them hidden from the public, while a scientist tries to determine the cause of their strange behavior. the doctor has no answer and says that they must come forward to chief bogo but the mayor refuses, saying his reputation as a predator official is at stake. nick and judy manage to get the evidence judy recorded back to bogo. lionheart and those involved are arrested and bellwether becomes the new mayor. lionheart protests that they still don't know why predators are going savage and he was trying to protect the public. judy, praised for solving the case and now friends with nick, asks him to join the zpd as her partner. however, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a biological cause for the recent savage behavior. at a press conference, she accidentally implies the savageness epidemic was caused by the physiology that all predators possess. disappointed and offended, nick abandons judy, whose comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout zootopia. a wedge is driven between the predator and prey populations, with prey acting fearful against all predators. gazelle hosts a peaceful protest against discrimination, despite backlash, and savage attacks continue in the city as more predators go primal.\ntv network znn covers singer gazelle's (shakira) peace protest and the police misconduct against predators. bellwether explains that with the population in zootopia being 90% prey, she wants judy as the face of the zpd to inspire hope. but, wracked with guilt, judy quits her job and returns to bunnyburrow. back in bunnyburrow, judy's parents explain that they've partnered up with gideon and never would have done so had judy not opened their eyes. gideon is red fox from bunnyburrow who used to bully the young rabbits and sheep when he was young. as an adult, he has made amends with those he picked on and became a much-respected baker. gideon apologizes to judy for what he did when he was younger, stating that his own insecurities manifested into unchecked rage, but judy forgives him and says she knows a thing or two about being a jerk. judy learns from her parents and her reformed childhood bully gideon grey (phil johnston) that \"night howlers\" are not wolves, but actually toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals. after she returns to zootopia and reconciles with nick, they confront weaselton, who tells them the night howler bulbs he'd stolen earlier were for a ram named doug (rich moore) an emotionless ram chemist and sniper with puffy wool who works for assistant mayor bellwether. they find doug in a lab hidden in the subway tunnels, creating an illegal drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a dart gun. he loads a pellet into a gun as his phone rings, telling him his next mark is a cheetah in sahara square. he assures the caller he can make the hit since he was able to get an otter in a moving car. judy and nick obtain the dart gun and the serum and escape the facility in a car. they are chased by doug's ram henchmen. after a fight, nick manages to save the evidence as he and judy defeat the henchmen jesse and woolter pursuing them. they run upstairs out of the station and into the natural history museum, empty due to renovations. as they near the exit toward the police station they are called from behind by mayor bellwether, accompanied by two rams in police uniform. these rams are jesse and woolter. but before they can go to the zpd, bellwether confronts them and steals the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy. bellwether calls out to judy, saying that in the city prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. they need to band together to end their mistreatment against the more powerful and loud predators and, once united, will be unstoppable. bellwether calls the police and feigns alarm, saying officer judy is down and being attacked by a savage fox. bellwether says that fear always works and, with a predisposition to savagery, predators will be forced out of zootopia, and she'll dart everyone to keep it that way. judy and nick are trapped in a pit after nick refuses to abandon judy when she is injured. bellwether shoots a serum pellet at nick to make him kill judy, but nick had disarmed bellwether's dart gun by replacing the serum pellets with blueberries. enraged, bellwether threatens to frame judy and nick for the attacks like she framed lionheart, but judy has recorded bellwether's confession on her pen recorder. bogo and the zpd arrive, and bellwether is arrested. in the news coverage that follows, former mayor lionheart gives an interview where he says he didn't know about bellwether's plot and only caged the savage predators to protect the city, citing he did a wrong thing for the right reasons. it is announced that an antidote has been created with positive effects. judy goes to the hospital where she sees emmitt otterton recovering and embracing his concerned wife. judy rejoins the zpd, and nick becomes the city's first fox police officer, as well as her partner. the next day, chief bogo hands out assignments, giving nick and judy the task of catching a hot-rod tearing up the roads downtown. judy and nick come across the speeder in their patrol car and pull him over, surprised to see flash the sloth behind the wheel."

      "plot_summary": "In Bunnyburrow, young Judy Hopps declares she will become a police officer despite ridicule from classmates including Gideon Grey and her parents, Bonnie and Stu. Years later Judy graduates valedictorian from the Zootopia Police Academy and moves to Zootopia, but Chief Bogo assigns her to parking enforcement. Judy writes hundreds of tickets and tries to prove herself. While on duty she is conned by Nick Wilde and his partner Finnick with a jumbo pop scam; Judy later confronts Nick but he taunts her about the city's realities. When Mrs. Otterton arrives at the ZPD pleading that her husband Emmitt Otterton is missing, Judy volunteers to take the case. Assistant Mayor Bellwether secures the assignment but Bogo gives Judy 48 hours and threatens resignation if she fails.\n\nJudy finds that a photo of Emmitt shows Nick with a popsicle; she coerces Nick into helping by recording him confessing tax evasion. Their investigation leads them to the Oasis and yoga instructor Nangi, then to a DMV run by sloths to run a license plate; they discover a limousine with otterton's wallet and polar-bear fur. Nick recognizes Mr. Big's insignia and they are brought before crime boss Mr. Big. Mr. Big explains Emmitt \"went savage\" and attacked his chauffeur; afterwards Mr. Big spares them because Judy previously saved his daughter Fru Fru. Manchas, Mr. Big's chauffeur, says Emmitt yelled about \"night howlers,\" then suddenly goes savage and chases Judy and Nick; they escape and call the ZPD, but when police arrive Manchas has disappeared. Bogo demands Judy resign but she keeps ten hours left.\n\nJudy and Nick trace the abductions to wolves operating at night; Bellwether gives them access to traffic cameras and they discover a van disappearing in a maintenance tunnel. Following the tunnel they find the missing predators imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum and evidence that Mayor Leodore Lionheart has been hiding them. Judy and Nick get proof and Lionheart and his collaborators are arrested. Bellwether becomes mayor. At a press conference Judy, clumsily suggesting a biological cause, implies predators' physiology might be responsible for the savage incidents; the remark ignites public fear and anti-predator discrimination. Nick, offended, leaves Judy as predators face escalating persecution. Judy, guilt-ridden, quits and returns to Bunnyburrow. There she learns from reformed bully Gideon Grey and her parents that \"night howlers\" are actually toxic night-howler flower bulbs with psychotropic effects. She returns to Zootopia to reconcile with Nick.\n\nJudy and Nick interrogate Duke Weaselton, who admits he stole night-howler bulbs for Doug, a ram chemist working for Assistant Mayor Bellwether. They track Doug to a hidden subway lab where he has been converting night-howler toxin into a serum and darting predators to provoke savage episodes. They obtain the serum and a dart gun but are pursued. They escape to the Natural History Museum where Bellwether appears with two ram officers (Doug's henchmen), reveals herself as the mastermind and explains she engineered the predator panic to shift power to prey; she intended to frame predators and control the city. Bellwether shoots a pellet at Nick ordering him to kill Judy, but the pellet contains blueberries because Nick had swapped them earlier. Judy records Bellwether's confession on her recorder. Bogo and the ZPD arrive; Bellwether is arrested.\n\nMayor Lionheart gives a public statement that he had tried to contain the crisis; an antidote is developed and victims begin to recover, including Emmitt Otterton. Judy rejoins the ZPD; Nick is sworn in as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.

      "in the town of bunnyburrow, 9-year-old bunny, judy hopps (della saba) is performing in a school play. her theme explains that animals, once primitive and wild, have now evolved to where predators and prey can live side by side in harmony. the founding mammal city, zootopia, is hailed as a place where anyone can be anything. judy then announces that she wants to be a police officer.\na kid fox in the audience, gideon grey (phil johnston), sneers at the idea and even judy's parents, bonnie (bonnie hunt) and stu (don lake) tell her that there's never been a bunny officer. however, judy is willing to try against all odds. when judy sees gideon bullying some kids by taking their fair tickets, she boldly confronts him, but gideon responds by taunting judy's dreams and slashing her in the face. he leaves and, though she's hurt, judy shows her friends the tickets she got back and declares that she doesn't know when to quit. years later, judy hopps (ginnifer goodwin), a rabbit from rural bunnyburrow, fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban zootopia. judy is tiny compared to the other recruits and faces difficulties managing the obstacle courses run by the drill sergeant (fuschia!). but through sheer determination, and by using her wits, judy makes it to graduation as valedictorian. zootopia mayor lionheart (j.k. simmons) oversees the ceremony and assistant mayor bellwether (jenny slate), a sheep, formally congratulates judy as the first bunny police officer, saying it's a big day for all small animals. a few days after, judy, her parents, and many siblings head to the train station. stu convinces judy to take a can of fox repellent with her before she gets on the train to zootopia. judy listens to a hit by pop singer, gazelle (shakira), as she zooms through the diverse districts of the city, from the frozen tundra to the sultry rain-forest. she finds her apartment, a run-down single room with a rickety bed, paper-thin walls, and two noisy neighbors, bucky (byron howard) and pronk oryx-antlerson ( jared bush). despite being the police academy valedictorian, judy is relegated to parking duty by chief bogo (idris elba), who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. judy is disappointed but sets her standards high and uses her sharp ears to help her write 200 tickets before noon. on her first day at the zootopia police department / zpd, she is hustled by nick wilde (jason bateman) and finnick (tom lister jr.), a con artist duo of foxes. finnick acts as a child, who is desperate to get a jumbo pop on his birthday. nick is acting his father. they con judy into buying them a jumbo pop, which they later melt and refreeze into hundreds of mini pops which they sell to school kids, on which they make a healthy profit. the pop sticks, they sell to a rat construction site, selling it as red-wood. judy observes the whole operation and later confronts nick. nick doesn't deny that he's a hustler but provides judy with all the paperwork he needs to make his endeavors technically legal and humbles her by saying that the city is not a magical land where dreams come true and a meter maid can never be a real cop. the next day, judy abandons parking duty to arrest duke weaselton (alan tudyk), a thief who stole plant crocus bulbs. bogo reprimands her for abandoning her post (as the parking ticket officer). an otter named mrs. otterton (octavia spencer) enters bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. judy volunteers, and bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination.\nthe city's assistant mayor, ewe dawn bellwether (jenny slate) arrives at the station and otterton pleads her case to bellwether and says how judy volunteered to help her. bellwether praises judy for taking the assignment, bogo agrees but demands judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours. after determining nick was the last one to see otterton. on the last seen photo of emmit, judy notices that nick is eating a popsicle which looks exactly like what nick was selling the other day. judy blackmails nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion. he then takes them into the oasis to find emmitt's yoga instructor, an elephant named nangi (gita reddy), and judy is shocked to find the oasis is a haven for naturalists or nude animals. nangi has no memory of otterton, but yax unwittingly gives judy all the information she needs, including the plate number for the car otterton was picked up in the last time he was there. nick says he has a friend at the dmv who can help them run the plate number. there, judy is disheartened to see that the dmv is run solely by sloths. by the time they exit, it's nighttime. they track a limousine that picked up emmitt. they search it, finding polar bear fur, claw marks all over the back seat, and otterton's wallet. nick recognizes an insignia on a drinking glass and realizes that the vehicle is owned by mr. big (maurice lamarche), an arctic shrew crime boss whom nick has a history with. nick sold him an expensive rug made from the fur of a skunk's behind. mr big's henchmen capture nick and judy and bring them to big. big berates nick for tarnishing his trust and the hospitality of his grandmother who he recently buried in the skunk rug and scolds him for returning on the day of his daughter's wedding. mr. big orders his bears to 'ice' nick and judy and they're held over a trap door in the floor that reveals icy water. mr. big's daughter, fru fru (leah latham), then walks in wearing her wedding dress and recognizes judy as the bunny that saved her the previous day from being crushed by the doughnut.\nmr. big reveals that otterton was his florist, but he went \"savage\", reverted to a feral state, and attacked his chauffeur, manchas (jesse corti). at his home, manchas mentions that otterton had been yelling about \"night howlers.\" moments later, manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. judy saves nick by trapping manchas and calls the zpd for help. when bogo and other police arrive, however, manchas had vanished. bogo demands judy's resignation, but nick reminds bogo she still has 10 hours to solve the case.\nover the rain-forest, nick explains that he was idealistic like judy once. as a kid, he wanted nothing more than to join the junior ranger scouts. his mother bought him a new uniform and he was excited to become part of the group, despite the fact that he was the only predator to join. upon arriving, however, the other animals bullied and muzzled him, saying that he was stupid for thinking they'd trust a fox. after that day he decided he would never let anyone see that they had gotten to him and if people only thought of foxes as untrustworthy, then that's what he would be. deciding there was no use in fighting prejudiced ideas about fox behavior, he became a con artist. judy recalls that assistant mayor bellwether offered to help them. bellwether gives judy and nick access to the city's traffic-camera system. they discover manchas was captured by wolves, which judy surmises are the \"night howlers\". they watch as the wolves' van drives through a tunnel but fails to come out the other side. nick says that there's a maintenance tunnel and, if he were to do anything illegal, that's the route he'd take to avoid observation. they find otterton and the other missing predators imprisoned at cliffside asylum, where mayor leodore lionheart (j. k. simmons) is keeping them hidden from the public, while a scientist tries to determine the cause of their strange behavior. the doctor has no answer and says that they must come forward to chief bogo but the mayor refuses, saying his reputation as a predator official is at stake. nick and judy manage to get the evidence judy recorded back to bogo. lionheart and those involved are arrested and bellwether becomes the new mayor. lionheart protests that they still don't know why predators are going savage and he was trying to protect the public. judy, praised for solving the case and now friends with nick, asks him to join the zpd as her partner. however, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a biological cause for the recent savage behavior. at a press conference, she accidentally implies the savageness epidemic was caused by the physiology that all predators possess. disappointed and offended, nick abandons judy, whose comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout zootopia. a wedge is driven between the predator and prey populations, with prey acting fearful against all predators. gazelle hosts a peaceful protest against discrimination, despite backlash, and savage attacks continue in the city as more predators go primal.\ntv network znn covers singer gazelle's (shakira) peace protest and the police misconduct against predators. bellwether explains that with the population in zootopia being 90% prey, she wants judy as the face of the zpd to inspire hope. but, wracked with guilt, judy quits her job and returns to bunnyburrow. back in bunnyburrow, judy's parents explain that they've partnered up with gideon and never would have done so had judy not opened their eyes. gideon is red fox from bunnyburrow who used to bully the young rabbits and sheep when he was young. as an adult, he has made amends with those he picked on and became a much-respected baker. gideon apologizes to judy for what he did when he was younger, stating that his own insecurities manifested into unchecked rage, but judy forgives him and says she knows a thing or two about being a jerk. judy learns from her parents and her reformed childhood bully gideon grey (phil johnston) that \"night howlers\" are not wolves, but actually toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals. after she returns to zootopia and reconciles with nick, they confront weaselton, who tells them the night howler bulbs he'd stolen earlier were for a ram named doug (rich moore) an emotionless ram chemist and sniper with puffy wool who works for assistant mayor bellwether. they find doug in a lab hidden in the subway tunnels, creating an illegal drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a dart gun. he loads a pellet into a gun as his phone rings, telling him his next mark is a cheetah in sahara square. he assures the caller he can make the hit since he was able to get an otter in a moving car. judy and nick obtain the dart gun and the serum and escape the facility in a car. they are chased by doug's ram henchmen. after a fight, nick manages to save the evidence as he and judy defeat the henchmen jesse and woolter pursuing them. they run upstairs out of the station and into the natural history museum, empty due to renovations. as they near the exit toward the police station they are called from behind by mayor bellwether, accompanied by two rams in police uniform. these rams are jesse and woolter. but before they can go to the zpd, bellwether confronts them and steals the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy. bellwether calls out to judy, saying that in the city prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. they need to band together to end their mistreatment against the more powerful and loud predators and, once united, will be unstoppable. bellwether calls the police and feigns alarm, saying officer judy is down and being attacked by a savage fox. bellwether says that fear always works and, with a predisposition to savagery, predators will be forced out of zootopia, and she'll dart everyone to keep it that way. judy and nick are trapped in a pit after nick refuses to abandon judy when she is injured. bellwether shoots a serum pellet at nick to make him kill judy, but nick had disarmed bellwether's dart gun by replacing the serum pellets with blueberries. enraged, bellwether threatens to frame judy and nick for the attacks like she framed lionheart, but judy has recorded bellwether's confession on her pen recorder. bogo and the zpd arrive, and bellwether is arrested. in the news coverage that follows, former mayor lionheart gives an interview where he says he didn't know about bellwether's plot and only caged the savage predators to protect the city, citing he did a wrong thing for the right reasons. it is announced that an antidote has been created with positive effects. judy goes to the hospital where she sees emmitt otterton recovering and embracing his concerned wife. judy rejoins the zpd, and nick becomes the city's first fox police officer, as well as her partner. the next day, chief bogo hands out assignments, giving nick and judy the task of catching a hot-rod tearing up the roads downtown. judy and nick come across the speeder in their patrol car and pull him over, surprised to see flash the sloth behind the wheel."

    "synopsis": [
      "dewey finn (jack black) is a guitarist of an unpopular rock band no vacancy. dewey's arrogance and hyperactive stage antics causes various disadvantages for the band mates. the next day, no vacancy votes dewey out of the band and replaces him with another guitarist named spider (lucas babin). furthermore, dewey's submissive roommate and lifelong friend, ned schneebly (mike white), is pressured by his girlfriend, patty di marco (sarah silverman), to evict dewey unless he gets a real job to pay back his growing rent debt. dewey thinks about having to quit music until he receives an urgent phone call intended for ned from rosalie mullins (joan cusack), the principal of a prestigious prep school, horace green, asking ned to replace for a teacher who broke her leg. desperate for income to avoid getting evicted, dewey impersonates ned and takes the substitute teacher position for a fourth-grade class. upon appearing in the classroom, he requests the students to call him \"mr. s.\" after failing to spell \"schneebly\" on the blackboard. however, dewey incapably resorts to grimacing over his rental problems and being unemployed and allows his students to do anything they wish. occasionally, dewey gives casual and non-motivational lectures to the class. when dewey overhears his students playing in music class, he thinks that the children of his class are musically talented and decides to make his personal project by converting the class into a rock band and crew to serve as a vehicle to stardom by winning the upcoming battle of the bands, where he is out to avenge his eviction from his old band and win the $20,000 prize. when dewey realizes the kids are mostly interested in pop and hip-hop, he turns the school days into lessons of rock history as well as playing rock music, exposing his students to those artists he regards as rock legends. many rock legends are featured in classic photos and footage during a montage scene, including led zeppelin, the ramones, jimi hendrix, pink floyd, iggy pop, the who, rush, the clash, nirvana, ac/dc, black sabbath and david bowie. dewey narrowly avoids detection when rosalie decides to attend one of his class' lessons to check on their progress, forcing him to attempt to teach the actual course material. dewey attempts to make friends with her through rock music, by playing her favorite song \"edge of seventeen\" by stevie nicks on a jukebox while visiting a bar. the two become close friends and the class auditions for battle of the bands, which dewey informed them was their \"school project\". they are rejected because they show up too late despite the bill being full. with the help of class factotum and band manager summer hathaway (miranda cosgrove), dewey persuades the venue's managers to allow the students perform in battle of the bands by lying that the students are orphans and have been diagnosed with a blood disease. dewey becomes exposed when the real ned receives a paycheck from horace green in the mail, although he doesn't work there. he attempts to call the school about this, but dewey breaks the call and confesses everything to ned. he urges ned not to inform patty, but she manages to reveal the truth out of ned. during a parents' meeting later on, dewey meets the students' parents, who initially scrutinize dewey's teaching abilities, utilizing the fact that their children were becoming more engrossed in music rather than the usual schoolwork. ned eventually appears with the police and confronts dewey under pressure from patty. when rosalie appears, his real identity is revealed, causing dewey to become dismissed. back at his apartment, both dewey and patty argue who each should blame until ned intervenes and suggests that dewey should move out. the next day, the class decides they have still put too much work into not do the final show at battle of the bands, so summer arranges the class trip. they stop at dewey's apartment in an attempt to give him new energy and have him join them. rosalie discovers the children leave for the concert and informs their parents who are all in her office wanting answers from the events of the previous day. the parents and rosalie, informed by a phone call from patty, head to the concert venue to take their kids back. meanwhile, ned eventually stands up to patty and leaves her to go to the concert, much to her extreme dismay. at the concert, the band plays their eponymous song, written by their lead guitarist, zack mooneyham (joey gaydos jr.). regardless of the audience's reception and winning over the crowd, school of rock loses to no vacancy, but accept their defeat due to dewey's earlier proclamation that they were there not to win but rather to play \"one great show\". however, the audience (except one member) becomes distressed by no vacancy's winning acceptance and demand school of rock for an encore. the band returns to the stage to play a cover of \"it's a long way to the top (if you wanna rock 'n' roll)\" by ac/dc with an altered ending. the song segues into the film's closing credits. summer is seen calling on her cell phone as she enters the school of rock, a newly opened after-school program where dewey continues to coach the band itself while ned teaches beginner music students. the closing credits roll as the class, breaking the fourth wall, sings \"the movie is over, but we're still on screen.\""

      "plot_summary": "Dewey Finn, guitarist for the failing band No Vacancy, is kicked out by his bandmates after his arrogant, disruptive behavior costs them gigs. Evicted from the band and facing rent debt, Dewey lives with his meek friend and former bandmate Ned Schneebly. Ned is pressured by his girlfriend Patty Di Marco to get a steady job; when Horace Green prep school principal Rosalie Mullins calls for a substitute for a fourth-grade teacher who broke her leg, Dewey impersonates Ned to take the post. Introducing himself as \"Mr. S,\" Dewey initially treats the class with irreverence but soon overhears the students' musical talents during music class. Realizing the class contains skilled young musicians—including guitarist Zack Mooneyham, drummer Freddy Jones, keyboardist Lawrence, bassist Katie, and singer Summer Hathaway—Dewey decides to form a rock band with them to enter the local Battle of the Bands and win the $20,000 prize to solve his money problems and reclaim rock credibility. Dewey secretly transforms classroom lessons into rock history and music practice, staging auditions, assigning band roles, and grooming Summer as manager. He bonds with principal Rosalie by playing her favorite song and winning her sympathy, narrowly avoiding detection several times. The class auditions for the Battle of the Bands but are initially turned away; Dewey lies that the children are orphans with a blood disease to get them onstage. Ned begins to suspect when he receives Horace Green's paycheck in the mail and tries to call the school; Dewey intercepts the call and confesses. Patty learns the truth and, during a parent meeting convened by Rosalie, Ned arrives with the police and Dewey is exposed, publicly dismissed, and forced to leave. The students, determined to perform, persuade Dewey to come to the Battle of the Bands. Rosalie, the parents (spurred by Patty), and Ned rush to the venue to stop the performance. Onstage, the students—billed as School of Rock—play an original song written by Zack and give a powerful performance. They lose the contest to No Vacancy, but the crowd demands an encore; the band returns and plays AC/DC's \"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll),\" winning over the audience. After the show, Rosalie and the parents relent: Rosalie allows Dewey to continue teaching music as an after-school program called the School of Rock while Ned stays at Horace Green teaching beginner music. The film closes with the class performing as credits roll, and Dewey reunited with his students and his place in music.",

      "dewey finn (jack black) is a guitarist of an unpopular rock band no vacancy. dewey's arrogance and hyperactive stage antics causes various disadvantages for the band mates. the next day, no vacancy votes dewey out of the band and replaces him with another guitarist named spider (lucas babin). furthermore, dewey's submissive roommate and lifelong friend, ned schneebly (mike white), is pressured by his girlfriend, patty di marco (sarah silverman), to evict dewey unless he gets a real job to pay back his growing rent debt. dewey thinks about having to quit music until he receives an urgent phone call intended for ned from rosalie mullins (joan cusack), the principal of a prestigious prep school, horace green, asking ned to replace for a teacher who broke her leg. desperate for income to avoid getting evicted, dewey impersonates ned and takes the substitute teacher position for a fourth-grade class. upon appearing in the classroom, he requests the students to call him \"mr. s.\" after failing to spell \"schneebly\" on the blackboard. however, dewey incapably resorts to grimacing over his rental problems and being unemployed and allows his students to do anything they wish. occasionally, dewey gives casual and non-motivational lectures to the class. when dewey overhears his students playing in music class, he thinks that the children of his class are musically talented and decides to make his personal project by converting the class into a rock band and crew to serve as a vehicle to stardom by winning the upcoming battle of the bands, where he is out to avenge his eviction from his old band and win the $20,000 prize. when dewey realizes the kids are mostly interested in pop and hip-hop, he turns the school days into lessons of rock history as well as playing rock music, exposing his students to those artists he regards as rock legends. many rock legends are featured in classic photos and footage during a montage scene, including led zeppelin, the ramones, jimi hendrix, pink floyd, iggy pop, the who, rush, the clash, nirvana, ac/dc, black sabbath and david bowie. dewey narrowly avoids detection when rosalie decides to attend one of his class'

    "synopsis": [
      "in a winter landscape, ice harvesters use saws and hooks to cut blocks of ice from a lake, chanting as they work about how ice is a powerful force that's both beautiful and dangerous. they load the ice blocks onto their sled and ride off. they follow the northern lights through the sky, before panning down on a stave castle, located on the shores of a scandinavian fjord, ringed in by cliffs. elsa (idina menzel), princess of arendelle, possesses the ability to create ice and snow. elsa and her sister anna (kristen bell) decide to play in the winter snow and create a snowman. at anna's urging, elsa waves her hands, conjuring up a snow crystal, which she then shoots into the air. it explodes, raining snow down on them. to enhance the winter playground, she then stomps her foot, covering the entire floor with ice. they create a snowman that she nicknames olaf, who likes warm hugs. the girls play gleefully with olaf until anna makes a leap elsa wasn't prepared for and the blast of power meant to create a pile of snow hits anna in the head, knocking her out and turning several strands of her hair white. king agnarr of arendelle (maurice lamarche) and queen iduna (jennifer lee) seek help from trolls led by grand pabbie (ciaran hinds). agdar and his wife hastily load both girls onto their horses and ride at full speed into the mountains. the trolls heal anna and remove her memories of her sister's magic. grand pabbie observes that anna is lucky she was hit in the head, as a hit to the heart would have been fatal. he advises the family that it might be best if elsa doesn't use her powers around anna. grand pabbie warns elsa that her powers will grow, and although they are beautiful, they will be a great risk to her if she cannot learn to control them, as fear will be her greatest enemy. the royal couple then isolate the family in the castle and teach elsa to suppress her powers. the palace is closed to most visitors. staffing is reduced to a minimum. traumatized elsa spends most of her time in her room, afraid of hurting her sister again. anna, meanwhile, can't understand why her sister is shutting her out.\nwhile anna's life is dull but normal, elsa's powers grow stronger as she matures. her father cautions her to wear gloves to keep her icy magic in check, and to conceal her feelings, because strong emotions seem to cause her powers to manifest in unexpected ways.\nthey grow up lonely and estranged from each other. the rift between the two sisters even deepens after their parents are lost at sea in a storm. when elsa comes of age (when she turns 21), the kingdom prepares for her coronation and the castle gates open to the public for the first time. among the dignitaries is the duke of weselton (alan tudyk), a tradesman who wants to exploit the kingdom for profit. excited to be allowed out of the castle gates, anna explores the town and meets prince hans (santino fontana) of the southern isles, and they immediately develop a mutual attraction. elsa's coronation goes off without incident.\nanna's first friendly interaction with elsa in years brings quite the delightful feeling to anna, flustered at first, as well as seeing elsa so happy instead of serious and preserved boosts anna's confidence, prompting her to continue on with the conversation. the duke invites elsa for a dance, but she asks anna to accompany him instead. anna then takes to the floor with hans. the two of them quickly sneak off to spend the evening together, quickly realizing the mutual attraction between them. the romantic dance eventually leads to an entire date, with the entire night of the young couple being spent bonding. hans, during their time together, learns of anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting anna out one day when they were kids. hans then promises to never shut anna out unlike elsa, much to the princess' absolute joy.\nduring the reception, prince hans proposes marriage, and anna joyfully accepts. however, when they approach elsa, the queen forbids such a hasty marriage. elsa asks to speak to anna alone in private, likely to finally confess her abilities and why it's not wise to marry someone she just met without causing a scene that would expose her powers, but anna refuses any private conversation, stating whatever elsa has to say can be said to both her and hans. the sisters argue, and elsa is unable to control her emotions, culminating in her abilities being exposed to the guests. elsa makes a violent sweep with her left arm, causing a barrier of sharp icicles to suddenly appear around her. the whole town is afraid of the sudden display of these awesome powers & tries to shield themselves from elsa.\nelsa pleads for people to step back, moments before another bolt of ice shoots from her hands, nearly hitting the duke and his guards. she keeps running away, sprinting across the waters of the fjord, her feet forming an ice bridge, and vanishes into the forest on the other side of the fjord. panicked, elsa flees the palace, inadvertently unleashing an eternal winter on the kingdom in her wake. elsa is accused of witchcraft by the scheming duke of weselton. the duke of weselton declares they must take action and put an end to elsa's curse. anna, however, refuses and volunteers to seek out elsa herself and make things right, feeling that it's her fault for pushing her. elsa flees to the north mountain. high in the mountains far from arendelle, elsa casts off restraint and creates a solitary ice palace, and unknowingly brings to life her and anna's childhood snowman, olaf (josh gad). it is here she realizes that far away from what she was taught, being on her own, she can begin to control her powers. elsa changes her confining wardrobe into a shimmering dress, and vows to stay in seclusion, where she feels she can be herself, and harm no one else. anna sets out in search of her elder sister, leaving hans in command. anna is determined to return her to arendelle, end the winter, and mend their relationship.\nanna staggers through heavy snow to the cabin with the chimney, a place known as wandering oaken's trading post and sauna, run by its burly owner, oaken (chris williams). kristoff (jonathan groff) staggers in out of the storm, seeking to buy some rope, an ax, and carrots for sven. kristoff argues with oaken over the outrageous price gouging on the items he needs (due to oaken claiming that there's a supply and demand problem since kristoff is buying from the almost-bare shelves of the winter department), which ends with oaken roughly throwing kristoff out into the snow after kristoff makes the mistake of calling him a crook. kristoff and his reindeer sven take refuge in a barn on oaken's property, but are soon met by anna, who has bought kristoff's supplies for him, on condition he take her up the north mountain immediately. kristoff eventually agrees.\non the way the group encounters a pack of wolves and anna helps kristoff to fight them off. kristoff loses his sled when it falls off a cliff, and he is angry as he had just paid it off. kristoff and the others are now forced to walk. the group encounters olaf. anna doesn't recognize olaf until he gives his name. this jogs anna's memories and she remembers building him with elsa when they were young. anna and kristoff mention that they're looking for elsa so they can restore summertime, and olaf suddenly grows excited as it's his dream to see what summer is like, and he fantasizes about what he wants to do in the summertime. anna and kristoff choose not to reveal that he will melt in the summer heat, but follow him as he leads them to elsa's ice palace. when they get to the front door of elsa's palace, anna tells kristoff and olaf to wait outside, warning them that the last time she introduced elsa to a guy, she froze everything.\nanna and elsa are reunited, but elsa still fears hurting her sister. elsa is surprised to learn that her entire kingdom is frozen, and anna is surprised in turn to learn that elsa doesn't know how to stop it. but anna insists her sister's powers are no reason why they should be so distant. however, having seen olaf, elsa flashes back to accidentally hitting anna in the head with her snow abilities and grows scared, demanding anna leave. when anna tries to persuade her elder sister to return, elsa becomes agitated and accidentally strikes anna in the heart with her powers. she then creates a giant snow creature (that olaf calls marshmallow) to run the friends out of the ice castle. as they flee, kristoff notices that anna's hair is turning white. kristoff takes her to his family, who happen to be a group of rock trolls and the same ones that saved anna many years before. kristoff explains that as he had no family at a young age, the trolls took him and sven in.\ngrand pabbie comes forward and examines anna but concludes that this time her sister's powers struck her in the heart. they are told that anna's heart has been frozen, and unless it's thawed by \"an act of true love,\" she will become frozen solid forever. she weakly tells kristoff that hans can surely help, and they take off for arendelle. believing that only hans can save her, kristoff races back with her to arendelle. meanwhile, hans had gone on a search for anna. the duke of weselton volunteers his two bodyguards and secretly tells them to shoot elsa if they should encounter her. hans reaches elsa's castle and is attacked by marshmallow. hans is a skilled warrior and manages to defeat marshmallow. meanwhile, duke's men attack elsa, who defends herself and prepares to kill them.\nhans and his men show up just in time and hans pleads for her to stop, so she doesn't become the monster people accuse her of being. elsa settles down a bit at hans' words, realizing what she's doing. the guy pinned to the wall, still complying with the orders of the duke, aims his crossbow at elsa's head and prepares to shoot her. hans suddenly runs over and deflects the bow. the arrow is released and hits the bolt attaching an icy chandelier to the ceiling, which begins to fall straight for elsa's head. elsa tries to run, but the falling chandelier fragments and knocks her unconscious.\nhans brings her back to arendelle after she is knocked unconscious during a skirmish with the duke's men, shackling her in the dungeon. when anna is reunited with hans and begs him to kiss her to break the curse, hans refuses. hans explains that as the youngest of 13 brothers, he had no chance at claiming his family's throne, so he went looking for a royal family he could marry into. unable to get to elsa, he made anna's acquaintance and played on her naivete. he intended to marry her before causing some form of \"accident\" for elsa that would clear his path to the throne. however, given anna's current condition, he plans to simply let her frozen heart overcome her, then stab elsa, ending the eternal winter. leaving anna to die, hans goes to speak with the duke of weselton and several other dignitaries. he claims that elsa has caused anna to freeze to death, but before she died, he and anna recited their wedding vows. this apparently is enough to give him full authority to declare elsa guilty of treason and sentence her to death. elsa freezes her shackles to the point that they shatter, then breaks through the wall to the outside and heads out into the blizzard on the fjord. meanwhile, far from arendelle, kristoff and sven are trekking away when sven urges kristoff to go back. kristoff claims he has no need to, but as they look back at arendelle, a mysterious swirling cloud of snow begins to engulf the kingdom. the two then take off towards the growing danger. olaf finds anna and reveals kristoff is in love with her. olaf recalls how kristoff did so much to get her back to save her, when the wind blows a window open. olaf goes to close it, but in the distance, he sees kristoff and sven charging towards them. the two then travel together onto the fjord to find kristoff. hans confronts elsa and tells her anna is dead because of her actions. in elsa's despair, the storm suddenly stops, giving kristoff and anna the chance to reach each other. however, anna, seeing that hans is about to kill elsa, throws herself between the two and subsequently freezes solid, blocking the blow. as elsa grieves for her sister, anna begins to thaw as her decision to sacrifice herself to save her sister constitutes \"an act of true love.\" it is then that elsa realizes what can end the winter: love. and with this realization, she dissipates the ice and snow, and summer returns to the kingdom. olaf is found, and before he can melt, elsa creates a perpetual snow flurry above his head, which lets him survive the summer heat. hans is sent back to the southern isles to face punishment for his crimes against the royal family of arendelle, and the duke is told that elsa has cut off trade with weselton.\nelsa appoints kristoff the royal ice deliverer, and he and anna share a kiss. anna and kristoff share a kiss, and the two sisters reconcile, with elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again."

      "plot_summary": "In Arendelle, young Princesses Elsa and Anna play in winter; Elsa (who can create ice and snow) accidentally injures Anna with her powers, turning a lock of Anna's hair white. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, take them to the trolls led by Grand Pabbie, who heal Anna and remove her memories of magic but warn Elsa to control her power and fear. The royal family isolates the sisters; Elsa grows up hidden and taught to suppress emotion, while Anna becomes lonely. Years later, after their parents die at sea, Elsa's coronation opens the castle gates. Anna meets Prince Hans of the Southern Isles and impulsively accepts his marriage proposal; when Anna presses Elsa to bless the match, Elsa panics, loses control and exposes her powers to the guests. The townspeople and the Duke of Weselton accuse Elsa of witchcraft; Elsa flees across the fjord, unknowingly plunging Arendelle into eternal winter. Anna volunteers to find Elsa and restore summer.\n\nAnna travels north, stopping at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post where she meets mountain man Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. Kristoff eventually agrees to guide her up the North Mountain. They fight wolves, lose Kristoff's sled, and meet Olaf, the enchanted snowman Elsa had created as a child. Olaf leads them to Elsa's ice palace. Anna reunites with Elsa, who briefly relaxes and then panics when Anna's memory of being struck returns; Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the heart with magic and creates a giant snow guard, Marshmallow, to drive them out. Kristoff finds Anna's hair turning white and takes her to the trolls. Grand Pabbie diagnoses Anna with a frozen heart: only an \"act of true love\" can thaw it. Believing Hans to be her true love, Kristoff races Anna back to Arendelle while Olaf accompanies them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Weselton orders soldiers to kill Elsa; Hans returns to Arendelle, defeats Marshmallow, and escorts an unconscious Elsa back to the kingdom, imprisoning her. The duke and Hans conspire to eliminate Elsa. Hans, however, betrays Anna: he reveals to her that he courted her to marry into the throne and planned to let Anna die and then kill Elsa to seize power. He leaves the frozen Anna chained in a room and goes to confront Elsa and the nobles, framing Elsa for Anna's death. Elsa breaks free from her cell and races back across the fjord; a violent storm envelopes Arendelle. Kristoff reaches Anna and, told Olaf's memory of Kristoff's devotion, realizes Kristoff loves Anna. Hans confronts Elsa on the frozen fjord and moves to stab her; Anna, who is beginning to freeze solid, throws herself between them and becomes fully frozen, stopping Hans' blade. Elsa, witnessing Anna's apparent death and her sister's love, melts with grief; Anna's frozen state begins to thaw because Anna's self-sacrifice is an act of true love. Elsa understands that love—not fear—controls her power; she dispels the eternal winter and restores summer. Olaf survives because Elsa conjures a personal snow flurry for him. Hans is arrested and sent back to the Southern Isles to face punishment; the Duke of Weselton is cut off from trade. Elsa promises to no longer hide and reopens the castle gates. Kristoff is named royal ice harvester/deliverer and shares a kiss with Anna; Elsa and Anna reconcile and rule together as summer returns to Arendelle.",

      "in a winter landscape, ice harvesters use saws and hooks to cut blocks of ice from a lake, chanting as they work about how ice is a powerful force that's both beautiful and dangerous. they load the ice blocks onto their sled and ride off. they follow the northern lights through the sky, before panning down on a stave castle, located on the shores of a scandinavian fjord, ringed in by cliffs. elsa (idina menzel), princess of arendelle, possesses the ability to create ice and snow. elsa and her sister anna (kristen bell) decide to play in the winter snow and create a snowman. at anna's urging, elsa waves her hands, conjuring up a snow crystal, which she then shoots into the air. it explodes, raining snow down on them. to enhance the winter playground, she then stomps her foot, covering the entire floor with ice. they create a snowman that she nicknames olaf, who likes warm hugs. the girls play gleefully with olaf until anna makes a leap elsa wasn't prepared for and the blast of power meant to create a pile of snow hits anna in the head, knocking her out and turning several strands of her hair white. king agnarr of arendelle (maurice lamarche) and queen iduna (jennifer lee) seek help from trolls led by grand pabbie (ciaran hinds). agdar and his wife hastily load both girls onto their horses and ride at full speed into the mountains. the trolls heal anna and remove her memories of her sister's magic. grand pabbie observes that anna is lucky she was hit in the head, as a hit to the heart would have been fatal. he advises the family that it might be best if elsa doesn't use her powers around anna. grand pabbie warns elsa that her powers will grow, and although they are beautiful, they will be a great risk to her if she cannot learn to control

pabbie comes forward and examines anna but concludes that this time her sister's powers struck her in the heart. they are told that anna's heart has been frozen, and unless it's thawed by \"an act of true love,\" she will become frozen solid forever. she weakly tells kristoff that hans can surely help, and they take off for arendelle. believing that only hans can save her, kristoff races back with her to arendelle. meanwhile, hans had gone on a search for anna. the duke of weselton volunteers his two bodyguards and secretly tells them to shoot elsa if they should encounter her. hans reaches elsa's castle and is attacked by marshmallow. hans is a skilled warrior and manages to defeat marshmallow. meanwhile, duke's men attack elsa, who defends herself and prepares to kill them.\nhans and his men show up just in time and hans pleads for her to stop, so she doesn't become the monster people accuse her of being. elsa settles down a bit at hans' words, realizing what she's doing. the guy pinned to the wall, still complying with the orders of the duke, aims his crossbow at elsa's head and prepares to shoot her. hans suddenly runs over and deflects the bow. the arrow is released and hits the bolt attaching an icy chandelier to the ceiling, which begins to fall straight for elsa's head. elsa tries to run, but the falling chandelier fragments and knocks her unconscious.\nhans brings her back to arendelle after she is knocked unconscious during a skirmish with the duke's men, shackling her in the dungeon. when anna is reunited with hans and begs him to kiss her to break the curse, hans refuses. hans explains that as the youngest of 13 brothers, he had no chance at claiming his family's throne, so he went looking for a royal family he could marry into. unable to get to elsa, he made anna's acquaintance and played on her naivete. he intended to marry her before causing some form of \"accident\" for elsa that would clear his path to the throne. however, given anna's current condition, he plans to simply let her frozen heart overcome her, then stab elsa, ending the eternal winter. leaving anna to die, hans goes to speak with the duke of weselton and several other dignitaries. he claims that elsa has caused anna to freeze to death, but before she died, he and anna recited their wedding vows. this apparently is enough to give him full authority to declare elsa guilty of treason and sentence her to death. elsa freezes her shackles to the point that they shatter, then breaks through the wall to the outside and heads out into the blizzard on the fjord. meanwhile, far from arendelle, kristoff and sven are trekking away when sven urges kristoff to go back. kristoff claims he has no need to, but as they look back at arendelle, a mysterious swirling cloud of snow begins to engulf the kingdom. the two then take off towards the growing danger. olaf finds anna and reveals kristoff is in love with her. olaf recalls how kristoff did so much to get her back to save her, when the wind blows a window open. olaf goes to close it, but in the distance, he sees kristoff and sven charging towards them. the two then travel together onto the fjord to find kristoff. hans confronts elsa and tells her anna is dead because of her actions. in elsa's despair, the storm suddenly stops, giving kristoff and anna the chance to reach each other. however, anna, seeing that hans is about to kill elsa, throws herself between the two and subsequently freezes solid, blocking the blow. as elsa grieves for her sister, anna begins to thaw as her decision to sacrifice herself to save her sister constitutes \"an act of true love.\" it is then that elsa realizes what can end the winter: love. and with this realization, she dissipates the ice and snow, and summer returns to the kingdom. olaf is found, and before he can melt, elsa creates a perpetual snow flurry above his head, which lets him survive the summer heat. hans is sent back to the southern isles to face punishment for his crimes against the royal family of arendelle, and the duke is told that elsa has cut off trade with weselton.\nelsa appoints kristoff the royal ice deliverer, and he and anna share a kiss. anna and kristoff share a kiss, and the two sisters reconcile, with elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again."

    "synopsis": [
      "fairy tale story-within-a-story with an all-star cast. in the frame story, a grandfather ( peter falk ) reads a favorite book to his sick grandson ( fred savage ). the book he reads, the princess bride by s. morgenstern, is about the most beautiful woman in the world, the hero who loves her, and the evil prince who says he wants to marry her. the lovely buttercup ( robin wright ) is kidnapped on the eve of her wedding to prince humperdinck ( chris sarandon ) of florin. (buttercup isn't in love with humperdinck; long ago she gave her heart to westley ( cary elwes ), a farmhand. but she's given westley up for dead because his ship was captured by the notorious take-no-prisoners dread pirate roberts and she's heard nothing for years, so she might as well marry humperdinck.) the kidnappers carry her off in a boat and up the cliffs of insanity, pursued by a mysterious masked man in black. at the top of the cliffs, vizzini the sicilian ( wallace shawn ), the chief bad guy, leaves his henchman inigo montoya ( mandy patinkin ) to deal with the man in black. inigo is a superb swordsman, but in a spectacular cliff-top duel after a most gentlemanly accommodating chat, the man in black proves to be better. sparing inigo's life, he goes off in pursuit of buttercup and her captors. the huge and immensely strong fezzik ( andré rené roussimoff ), vizzini's remaining henchman, tries to overpower him, but the man in black manages to choke fezzik until he loses consciousness. when he catches up with vizzini and his captive, the man in black challenges the sicilian to a battle of wits in which one of them is sure to die. he has a packet of highly poisonous iocaine powder and two goblets of wine. out of vizzini's sight, he adds iocaine to one of the goblets. he places one goblet in front of vizzini and one in front of himself. vizzini must choose whether to drink from the goblet given to him or the one the man in black kept for himself; the man in black will drink from the remaining goblet. after a fevered application of logic, vizzini chooses, drinks, and dies -- the man in black, who has spent years developing a tolerance of iocaine, has poisoned both goblets. the man in black tells buttercup he's the dread pirate roberts and he's taking her to his ship. buttercup, infuriated that the man who killed westley has come after her, pushes him down a mountainside. as he tumbles down the steep incline, he says \"as you wish...\" -- which westley used to say to buttercup. realizing that the man in black is westley, buttercup goes down after him and learns his story: rather than killing him, the dread pirate roberts took westley on as his apprentice. he taught westley everything he knew, then retired, bestowing his ship and his name on westley. westley didn't reveal himself to buttercup at first because he didn't think she still loved him. meanwhile, prince humperdinck -- who of course arranged the kidnapping -- has raised the alarm and given chase. he wants an excuse to go to war with guilder, the neighboring country toward which buttercup's captors were carrying her. westley and buttercup flee into the fearsome fire swamp to escape their pursuers. the fire swamp offers no end of excitement: hungry rouses (rodents of unusual size), lightning sand (quicksand on steroids), and unpredictable jets of flame shooting out of the ground -- but westley gets them through it. alas, it's all for nothing; they're captured by prince humperdinck and his men as soon as they emerge from the swamp. so buttercup makes a deal; she'll go back and marry humperdinck in exchange for westley's freedom. humperdinck has no intention of holding up his end of the bargain and turns westley over to his friend and lieutenant, count rugen ( christopher guest ), as soon as buttercup is out of earshot. count rugen is a cruel and arrogant man whose history is tied to inigo montoya's. twenty years before, the count visited inigo's father diego montoya, a famously skilled swordsmith, and commissioned a sword of the highest quality. the job was challenging because count rugen (who did not give his name) has six fingers on his right hand. when the count came to collect his new weapon, which was the best diego montoya had ever made, rugen would pay only a fraction of the agreed-upon cost. when montoya objected, count rugen killed him. inigo challenged his father's killer to a duel, but he was only 11; the count bested him easily, left him with a scar on each cheek, and rode off -- without his new sword. the grief-stricken boy vowed to avenge his father and spent the next twenty years studying swordsmanship and searching for the six-fingered man. he kept the sword. count rugen has made a long study of pain and has built the machine, a suction-cup-based instrument of torture which he believes can inflict the most intense pain a human being can experience. he keeps the machine in a secret chamber beneath the castle grounds called the pit of despair, and it is here that westley is taken. humperdinck, with buttercup in tow, goes home to prepare for his wedding and for the invasion of guilder, for which he plans to get popular support in florin by murdering buttercup on their wedding night and blaming guilder. buttercup shortly realizes that her love for westley is so strong that she can't bring herself to marry humperdinck. she asks to be released from her promise on the grounds that she'll kill herself on her wedding night if forced to go through with it. humperdinck pretends to give in. he suggests that westley might no longer love buttercup, but he promises to send his four fastest ships in pursuit of the fugitive, carrying copies of a letter from buttercup asking westley to come back for her. he asks that if westley doesn't come back, she consider marrying him, humperdinck, as an alternative to suicide. buttercup, serenely confident that her westley will save her, agrees. in the days leading up the wedding, prince humperdinck makes a great show of beefing up security around the castle. he orders florin's thieves' forest cleared of potential troublemakers and the guard at the castle gate increased. fezzik is hired into the brute squad assigned to purge the thieves' forest and learns that count rugen -- inigo's long-sought six-fingered man -- is in the castle. when he finds a very inebriated inigo in the thieves' forest, fezzik takes him home, sobers him up, and tells him that he's found the six-fingered man. inigo and fezzik resolve to go after count rugen, but realize they need someone who's good at planning -- someone like the man in black. meanwhile in the pit of despair, count rugen has used the machine (on a low setting) to suck away a year of westley's life. when buttercup realizes that prince humperdinck never sent those ships to search for westley, she calls him a coward. he takes out his anger by running down to the pit, cranking the machine all the way up, and torturing westley to death. (buttercup still has no idea that humperdinck has westley.) fezzik and inigo hear westley's dying scream and come looking for him. near the pit they meet the albino ( mel smith ), who has brought a wheelbarrow to haul away westley's body. fezzik knocks him out by mistake before he can tell them where westley is, so inigo has to call on his father's spirit to guide him to the pit's hidden entrance (which is in a tree trunk). they reach the pit of despair to find that westley is dead and they need a miracle. cut to the frame story. the grandson is upset: how can westley be dead? who gets prince humperdinck in the end? nobody, says the grandfather -- humperdinck lives. the grandson becomes more upset, and the grandfather suggests that they stop reading the book for now. the grandson settles down and begs his grandfather to continue. inigo and fezzik take westley's body to miracle max ( billy crystal ), who is retired (having been fired by humperdinck) and doesn't want to take the job. he threatens to call the brute squad to run them off, but gives in when fezzik points out that he's on the the brute squad. max diagnoses westley as being mostly dead and (using bellows to give him the breath to answer) asks westley what in his life is worth coming back from the dead for; westley answers \"true love.\" max pretends to misunderstand, but his wife valerie ( carol kane ) badgers him to help and mentions that max lost his confidence when prince humperdinck gave him the sack. inigo says that westley is buttercup's true love, and if max can bring him back to life, it will ruin humperdinck's wedding. delighted at the prospect of doing the prince a bad turn, max accepts their money and whips up a large, chocolate-coated miracle pill. inigo and fezzik go off with westley and the pill, accompanied by max and valerie's good wishes. \"have fun storming the castle!\" on a rampart overlooking the castle gate, inigo and fezzik feed the miracle pill to westley's corpse. it works immediately -- at least, it brings him mostly back to life; he can talk, but he can't walk or move much. the three review the situation: the castle gate is guarded by 60 men and buttercup is due to be married in less than half an hour. they need to get in, rescue buttercup, and kill count rugen. their assets: inigo's sword, fezzik's strength, and westley's brains. westley objects that with so little time to plan, it can't be done -- though if they had a wheelbarrow, that might help. inigo and fezzik recall that the albino's wheelbarrow is handy, and when westley says \"what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak,\" fezzik produces one that max gave him because \"it fit so nice.\" in the castle chapel, the wedding is ready to begin. outside, a dark apparition (fezzik wearing the holocaust cloak and standing in the wheelbarrow, pushed with difficulty by inigo, who is also dragging the nearly-immobile westley) approaches the gate. \"i am the dread pirate roberts,\" the apparition booms. \"there will be no survivors!\" the guards at the gate waver. when inigo sets the holocaust cloak on fire, the guards flee, except for yellin ( malcolm storry ), humperdinck's chief enforcer. yellin gives up the gate key when they threaten to have fezzik rip his arms off. inigo, fezzik and westley encounter count rugen and some guards in a castle corridor. rugen sics the guards on inigo and fezzik, but inigo dispatches them easily. then he addresses count rugen: \"my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.\" count rugen extends his sword, thinks better of it, and runs away. humperdinck (who heard the commotion at the gate and sent rugen to investigate) has rushed the silly-voiced clergyman ( peter cook ) straight past the \"i do's\" to \"man and wife,\" and a bewildered buttercup (who was sure westley would save her before she was married) is escorted to the honeymoon suite by the king ( willoughby gray ) and queen ( anne dyson ), her new in-laws. buttercup thanks the king for his kindness and tells him she'll be killing herself shortly; the king (who's rather deaf and probably gaga) replies \"won't that be nice!\" inigo takes off after rugen but quickly runs into a locked door and calls for fezzik. fezzik drapes the rubbery-legged westley over a suit of armor and goes off to help. he's puzzled when he comes back a few minutes later and westley is gone. meanwhile, though, inigo has chased the count through the castle. brought to bay in a banquet hall, rugen pulls a dagger from his boot and throws it at inigo, hitting him in the stomach. inigo seems on the verge of expiring, and the count is able to wound him in both shoulders. then inigo pulls himself together and returns to the fight reciting his challenge, his voice and his attack strengthening with every repetition: \"hello, my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die!\" \"stop saying that,\" the unnerved count whines just before inigo closes in. after inflicting wounds on rugen's cheeks and shoulders that match the wounds rugen inflicted on him, inigo allows the count to bargain and beg for his life, then kills him with a thrust to the gut. in the honeymoon suite, buttercup takes up a dagger. as she prepares to kill herself, a voice behind her says \"there's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. it would be a pity to damage yours.\" she turns to find westley reclining on the bed and throws herself into his arms. after a moment of blissful reunion, buttercup confesses that without meaning to, she's married prince humperdinck. westley points out that if she didn't say \"i do\" (which she didn't because humperdinck made the clergyman skip most of the ceremony), it wasn't a legal wedding. humperdinck enters, declaring that he will remedy the technicality. but first, he wants to challenge westley to a battle to the death. westley counters, \"no! to the pain!\" he describes how he will disfigure the handsome prince, leaving him his ears so every shriek and cry uttered by people who see him will echo in his perfect ears. westley stands and tells humperdinck to drop his sword. cowed, humperdinck does, and then he sits in a chair as buttercup ties him to it. inigo stumbles in and offers to kill prince humperdinck, but westley wants him to live alone with his cowardice. they hear fezzik calling for inigo from the courtyard. fezzik has found four white horses, and since there are four of them, he brought them out with him. buttercup jumps down and fezzik catches her. inigo isn't sure what he'll do with the rest of his life. westley asks if he's considered piracy: \"you'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts.\" they jump down and all four ride away on the whites. the grandfather is finishing the story. before reading the last line, he closes the book, because it's more kissing. (the grandson doesn't like the kissy parts.) but the grandson says that he doesn't mind so much, so the grandfather reads the last line of the book: \"since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses rated the most passionate, the most pure. this one left them all behind.\" the grandfather tells the boy to go to sleep, and the grandson asks him to return the next day and read the book again. the grandfather replies, \"as you wish.\""

      "plot_summary": "In a hospital room in modern America, an elderly grandfather (the Grandfather) reads the book The Princess Bride to his sick grandson (the Grandson). The book story begins in the kingdom of Florin: Buttercup, a farmgirl, fell in love with the farm boy Westley, whose stock reply “As you wish” meant he loved her. Westley leaves to seek his fortune; he is reported killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup, resigned, becomes engaged to Prince Humperdinck of Florin. On a ride, Buttercup is kidnapped by three outlaws: Vizzini (a clever Sicilian), Inigo Montoya (a skilled Spanish swordsman), and Fezzik (a giant). They are pursued by a masked Man in Black. On the Cliffs of Insanity the Man in Black defeats Inigo in a fencing duel, knocks out Fezzik, outwits and kills Vizzini with poisoned wine, then reveals himself to Buttercup as Westley — he had become the Dread Pirate Roberts by apprenticeship and inheritance. Westley and Buttercup flee toward the Fire Swamp to escape Prince Humperdinck, who actually arranged the kidnapping to provoke a war with neighboring Guilder. In the Fire Swamp they survive ROUSes (rodents of unusual size), lightning sand, and flame spurts, but Humperdinck’s men capture them soon after. Buttercup bargains to return and marry Humperdinck in exchange for Westley’s freedom; Humperdinck betrays her and hands Westley to his sadistic lieutenant, Count Tyrone Rugen (the six-fingered man). Rugen tortures Westley in the Pit of Despair with “the machine,” sucking life from him until Westley is “mostly dead.” Meanwhile, Fezzik is recruited into Florin’s brute squad and reunites with an alcoholic Inigo; hearing that Rugen is in the castle and that Westley has been captured, Fezzik and Inigo set out to find the Man in Black. They discover Westley apparently dead and take his body to Miracle Max and his wife Valerie. Max, persuaded (and spiteful of Humperdinck), gives them a miracle pill that brings Westley back to life—partly. Inigo, Fezzik, and the revived Westley infiltrate Florin Castle using a wheeled disguise (Fezzik in a cloak on a wheelbarrow, Inigo pushing and dragging Westley). They force entry by bluffing as the Dread Pirate Roberts and burning the cloak to scare the guards. Inigo confronts Count Rugen in a prolonged duel, repeatedly declaring, “Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die,” and finally kills Rugen. Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik fight deeper into the castle; Westley rescues Buttercup in the honeymoon suite just as Humperdinck confronts them. Westley forces Humperdinck to drop his sword, threatens to mutilate him repeatedly, and secures their escape. Inigo, having fulfilled his revenge, contemplates his future; Westley suggests piracy. The four (Westley, Buttercup, Inigo, Fezzik) flee on four white horses. Back in the frame story, the Grandfather closes the book before a romantic final line, then reads it when the Grandson asks him to return the next day.",

      "fairy tale story-within-a-story with an all-star cast. in the frame story, a grandfather ( peter falk ) reads a favorite book to his sick grandson ( fred savage ). the book he reads, the princess bride by s. morgenstern, is about the most beautiful woman in the world, the hero who loves her, and the evil prince who says he wants to marry her. the lovely buttercup ( robin wright ) is kidnapped on the eve of her wedding to prince humperdinck ( chris sarandon ) of florin. (buttercup isn't in love with humperdinck; long ago she gave her heart to westley ( cary elwes ), a farmhand. but she's given westley up for dead because his ship was captured by the notorious take-no-prisoners dread pirate roberts and she's heard nothing for years, so she might as well marry humperdinck.) the kidnappers carry her off in a boat and up the cliffs of insanity, pursued by a mysterious masked man in black. at the top of the cliffs, vizzini the sicilian ( wallace shawn ), the chief bad guy, leaves his henchman inigo montoya ( mandy patinkin ) to deal with the man in black. inigo is a superb swordsman, but in a spectacular cliff-top duel after a most gentlemanly accommodating chat, the man in black proves to be better. sparing inigo's life, he goes off in pursuit of buttercup and her captors. the huge and immensely strong fezzik ( andré rené roussimoff ), vizzini's remaining henchman, tries to overpower him, but the man in black manages to choke fezzik until he loses consciousness. when he catches up with vizzini and his captive, the man in black challenges the sicilian to a battle of wits in which one of them is sure to die. he has a packet of highly poisonous iocaine powder and two goblets of wine. out of vizzini's sight, he adds iocaine to one of the goblets. he places one goblet in front of vizzini and one in front of himself. vizzini must choose whether to drink from the goblet given to him or the one the man in black kept for himself; the man in black will drink from the remaining goblet. after a fevered application of logic, vizzini chooses, drinks, and dies -- the man in black, who has spent years developing a tolerance of iocaine, has poisoned both goblets. the man in black tells buttercup he's the dread pirate roberts and he's taking her to his ship. buttercup, infuriated that the man who killed westley has come after her, pushes him down a mountainside. as he tumbles down the steep incline, he says \"as you wish...\" -- which westley used to say to buttercup. realizing that the man in black is westley, buttercup goes down after him and learns his story: rather than killing him, the dread pirate roberts took westley on as his apprentice. he taught westley everything he knew, then retired, bestowing his ship and his name on westley. westley didn't reveal himself to buttercup at first because he didn't think she still loved him. meanwhile, prince humperdinck -- who of course arranged the kidnapping -- has raised the alarm and given chase. he wants an excuse to go to war with guilder, the neighboring country toward which buttercup's captors were carrying her. westley and buttercup flee into the fearsome fire swamp to escape their pursuers. the fire swamp offers no end of excitement: hungry rouses (rodents of unusual size), lightning sand (quicksand on steroids), and unpredictable jets of flame shooting out of the ground -- but westley gets them through it. alas, it's all for nothing; they're captured by prince humperdinck and his men as soon as they emerge from the swamp. so buttercup makes a deal; she'll go back and marry humperdinck in exchange for westley's freedom. humperdinck has no intention of holding up his end of the bargain and turns westley over to his friend and lieutenant, count rugen ( christopher guest ), as soon as buttercup is out of earshot. count rugen is a cruel and arrogant man whose history is tied to inigo montoya's. twenty years before, the count visited inigo's father diego montoya, a famously skilled swordsmith, and commissioned a sword of the highest quality. the job was challenging because count rugen (who did not give his name) has six fingers on his right hand. when the count came to collect his new weapon, which was the best diego montoya had ever made, rugen would pay only a fraction of the agreed-upon cost. when montoya objected, count rugen killed him. inigo challenged his father's killer to a duel, but he was only 11; the count bested him easily, left him with a scar on each cheek, and rode off -- without his new sword. the grief-stricken boy vowed to avenge his father and spent the next twenty years studying swordsmanship and searching for the six-fingered man. he kept the sword. count rugen has made a long study of pain and has built the machine, a suction-cup-based instrument of torture which he believes can inflict the most intense pain a human being can experience. he keeps the machine in a secret chamber beneath the castle grounds called the pit of despair, and it is here that westley is taken. humperdinck, with buttercup in tow, goes home to prepare for his wedding and for the invasion of guilder, for which he plans to get popular support in florin by murdering buttercup on their wedding night and blaming guilder. buttercup shortly realizes that her love for westley is so strong that she can't bring herself to marry humperdinck. she asks to be released from her promise on the grounds that she'll kill herself on her wedding night if forced to go through with it. humperdinck pretends to give in. he suggests that westley might no longer love buttercup, but he promises to send his four fastest ships in pursuit of the fugitive, carrying copies of a letter from buttercup asking westley to come back for her. he asks that if westley doesn't come back, she consider marrying him, humperdinck, as an alternative to suicide. buttercup, serenely confident that her westley will save her, agrees. in the days leading up the wedding, prince humperdinck makes a great show of beefing up security around the castle. he orders florin's thieves' forest cleared of potential troublemakers and the guard at the castle gate increased. fezzik is hired into the brute squad assigned to purge the thieves' forest and learns that count rugen -- inigo's long-sought six-fingered man -- is in the castle. when he finds a very inebriated inigo in the thieves' forest, fezzik takes him home, sobers him up, and tells him that he's found the six-fingered man. inigo and fezzik resolve to go after count rugen, but realize they need someone who's good at planning -- someone like the man in black. meanwhile in the pit of despair, count rugen has used the machine (on a low setting) to suck away a year of westley's life. when buttercup realizes that prince humperdinck never sent those ships to search for westley, she calls him a coward. he takes out his anger by running down to the pit, cranking the machine all the way up, and torturing westley to death. (buttercup still has no idea that humperdinck has westley.) fezzik and inigo hear westley's dying scream and come looking for him. near the pit they meet the albino ( mel smith ), who has brought a wheelbarrow to haul away westley's body. fezzik knocks him out by mistake before he can tell them where westley is, so inigo has to call on his father's spirit to guide him to the pit's hidden entrance (which is in a tree trunk). they reach the pit of despair to find that westley is dead and they need a miracle. cut to the frame story. the grandson is upset: how can westley be dead? who gets prince humperdinck in the end? nobody, says the grandfather -- humperdinck lives. the grandson becomes more upset, and the grandfather suggests that they stop reading the book for now. the grandson settles down and begs his grandfather to continue. inigo and fezzik take westley's body to miracle max ( billy crystal ), who is retired (having been fired by humperdinck) and doesn't want to take the job. he threatens to call the brute squad to run them off, but gives in when fezzik points out that he's on the the brute squad. max diagnoses westley as being mostly dead and (using bellows to give him the breath to answer) asks westley what in his life is worth coming back from the dead for; westley answers \"true love.\" max pretends to misunderstand, but his wife valerie ( carol kane ) badgers him to help and mentions that max lost his confidence when prince humperdinck gave him the sack. inigo says that westley is buttercup's true love, and if max can bring him back to life, it will ruin humperdinck's wedding. delighted at the prospect of doing the prince a bad turn, max accepts their money and whips up a large, chocolate-coated miracle pill. inigo and fezzik go off with westley and the pill, accompanied by max and valerie's good wishes. \"have fun storming the castle!\" on a rampart overlooking the castle gate, inigo and fezzik feed the miracle pill to westley's corpse. it works immediately -- at least, it brings him mostly back to life; he can talk, but he can't walk or move much. the three review the situation: the castle gate is guarded by 60 men and buttercup is due to be married in less than half an hour. they need to get in, rescue buttercup, and kill count rugen. their assets: inigo's sword, fezzik's strength, and westley's brains. westley objects that with so little time to plan, it can't be done -- though if they had a wheelbarrow, that might help. inigo and fezzik recall that the albino's wheelbarrow is handy, and when westley says \"what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak,\" fezzik produces one that max gave him because \"it fit so nice.\" in the castle chapel, the wedding is ready to begin. outside, a dark apparition (fezzik wearing the holocaust cloak and standing in the wheelbarrow, pushed with difficulty by inigo, who is also dragging the nearly-immobile westley) approaches the gate. \"i am the dread pirate roberts,\" the apparition booms. \"there will be no survivors!\" the guards at the gate waver. when inigo sets the holocaust cloak on fire, the guards flee, except for yellin ( malcolm storry ), humperdinck's chief enforcer. yellin gives up the gate key when they threaten to have fezzik rip his arms off. inigo, fezzik and westley encounter count rugen and some guards in a castle corridor. rugen sics the guards on inigo and fezzik, but inigo dispatches them easily. then he addresses count rugen: \"my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.\" count rugen extends his sword, thinks better of it, and runs away. humperdinck (who heard the commotion at the gate and sent rugen to investigate) has rushed the silly-voiced clergyman ( peter cook ) straight past the \"i do's\" to \"man and wife,\" and a bewildered buttercup (who was sure westley would save her before she was married) is escorted to the honeymoon suite by the king ( willoughby gray ) and queen ( anne dyson ), her new in-laws. buttercup thanks the king for his kindness and tells him she'll be killing herself shortly; the king (who's rather deaf and probably gaga) replies \"won't that be nice!\" inigo takes off after rugen but quickly runs into a locked door and calls for fezzik. fezzik drapes the rubbery-legged westley over a suit of armor and goes off to help. he's puzzled when he comes back a few minutes later and westley is gone. meanwhile, though, inigo has chased the count through the castle. brought to bay in a banquet hall, rugen pulls a dagger from his boot and throws it at inigo, hitting him in the stomach. inigo seems on the verge of expiring, and the count is able to wound him in both shoulders. then inigo pulls himself together and returns to the fight reciting his challenge, his voice and his attack strengthening with every repetition: \"hello, my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die!\" \"stop saying that,\" the unnerved count whines just before inigo closes in. after inflicting wounds on rugen's cheeks and shoulders that match the wounds rugen inflicted on him, inigo allows the count to bargain and beg for his life, then kills him with a thrust to the gut. in the honeymoon suite, buttercup takes up a dagger. as she prepares to kill herself, a voice behind her says \"there's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. it would be a pity to damage yours.\" she turns to find westley reclining on the bed and throws herself into his arms. after a moment of blissful reunion, buttercup confesses that without meaning to, she's married prince humperdinck. westley points out that if she didn't say \"i do\" (which she didn't because humperdinck made the clergyman skip most of the ceremony), it wasn't a legal wedding. humperdinck enters, declaring that he will remedy the technicality. but first, he wants to challenge westley to a battle to the death. westley counters, \"no! to the pain!\" he describes how he will disfigure the handsome prince, leaving him his ears so every shriek and cry uttered by people who see him will echo in his perfect ears. westley stands and tells humperdinck to drop his sword. cowed, humperdinck does, and then he sits in a chair as buttercup ties him to it. inigo stumbles in and offers to kill prince humperdinck, but westley wants him to live alone with his cowardice. they hear fezzik calling for inigo from the courtyard. fezzik has found four white horses, and since there are four of them, he brought them out with him. buttercup jumps down and fezzik catches her. inigo isn't sure what he'll do with the rest of his life. westley asks if he's considered piracy: \"you'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts.\" they jump down and all four ride away on the whites. the grandfather is finishing the story. before reading the last line, he closes the book, because it's more kissing. (the grandson doesn't like the kissy parts.) but the grandson says that he doesn't mind so much, so the grandfather reads the last line of the book: \"since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses rated the most passionate, the most pure. this one left them all behind.\" the grandfather tells the boy to go to sleep, and the grandson asks him to return the next day and read the book again. the grandfather replies, \"as you wish.\""

      "an elderly man reads the book \"the princess bride\" to his sick and thus currently bedridden adolescent grandson, the reading of the book which has been passed down within the family for generations. the grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he prefers something with lots of action and \"no kissing\", but he lets grandfather continue, because he doesn't want to hurt his feelings. the story centers on buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to prince humperdinck of florin. buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, westley, five years ago. westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of \"as you wish\" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. but westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the dread pirate roberts. on a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named fezzik who works on his brawn, and a spaniard named inigo montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. they in turn are chased by the dread pirate roberts himself. but chasing them all is the prince, and his men led by count tyrone rugen. what happens to these collectives is dependent partly on buttercup, who does not want to marry the prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. but a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.",

    "synopsis": [
      "in santa cecilia, mexico, family matriarch imelda rivera (alanna ubach) was the wife of a musician. imelda's husband left imelda and her daughter, coco (ana ofelia murguía), to pursue a career in music. imelda banned music in the family and turned to shoe-making, which became the family business as each of the next generation was taught to make shoes by imelda and then by coco. 96 years later, her great-great-grandson, 12-year-old miguel (anthony gonzalez) now lives with the elderly coco and their family in a small mexican village. coco is miguel's great-grandmother, her daughters abuelita (renee victor) & late tia victoria (dyana ortelli) are miguel's grand-mothers, papa julio (alfonso arau) is coco's late husband, tia rosita (selene luna) is coco's late sister-in-law, tios oscar and felipe (herbert siguenza) are miguel's late uncles. the photographs of the deceased ancestors are preserved on the family ofrenda. papa (jaime camil) is abuelita's son & miguel's father, & mama (sofia espinosa) is his mother. tio berto (luis valdez) is papa's brother, and gloria (carla medina) is papa's sister. berto is married to carmen, and they have a son abel (polo rojas) and daughter rosa (montse hernandez). despite the family's continued ban on music, miguel secretly loves it and teaches himself to play guitar by watching videos of his idol, the late musician ernesto.\nhe secretly dreams of becoming a musician like ernesto de la cruz (benjamin bratt), a popular film/singing star of imelda's generation. ernesto made people fall in love with him and he had the coolest guitar, with which he sang the best songs including miguel's favorite \"remember me\". ernesto died in 1942 during a stage performance, when a heavy bell hung on stage accidentally fell right on top of him. miguel was giving a shoeshine to a mariachi while telling him his life's story. the mariachi encourages miguel to enter the talent show on day of the dead to honor the legacy of ernesto. but this is when abuelita arrives and chases away the mariachi. day of the dead is like a family reunion day except that the dead ancestors are the guests of honor. as per local folklore, only those ancestors are able to cross over who are remembered in some shape or form by the living relatives. this is why families put their ancestors' photos on the ofrenda.\ncoco is now old and senile, and she still asks imelda if her papa is coming home on the day of the dead. miguel has a secret ofrenda he has created for ernesto and even made a guitar himself. on the day of the dead, miguel inadvertently bumps the family ofrenda and breaks a frame containing a photo of imelda and an infant coco. he discovers a hidden section of the photograph that shows his great-great-grandfather (whose head has been torn from the photo) holding ernesto's famous guitar. miguel believes that this conclusively proves that ernesto is his ancestor. later, when miguel attempts to enter a talent show for the day of the dead, his grandmother abuelita destroys his guitar. miguel argues that he is supposed to be a musician, but his family is adamant that the man abandoned his family and the man's music was a curse. miguel runs away saying that he wants no part of his family. miguel goes to play in the town plaza, but he had no instrument, and nobody would lend him a guitar. miguel comes across ernesto's statue in the plaza, holding a guitar. he reckons that ernesto would have been buried with his beloved guitar. concluding that he is ernesto's great-great-grandson, miguel enters his tomb and steals his guitar to use in the show. when he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza but can see and be seen by his xoloitzcuintli dog dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the land of the dead for the holiday. miguel's dead relatives take him to the land of the dead (by crossing a large bridge made of flowers) and miguel is astounded that the land of the dead is a like a vast city, grown over centuries. at the end of the bridge are cross over officials who match the ancestors with their photos in their family's ofrenda. only is the photo being there, are the ancestors allowed to cross over. if anyone tries to cross over by force, the flower bridge traps them. they find that imelda is unable to cross over as her photo has been removed from the ofrenda. miguel also discovers that he has been cursed for stealing from the dead. miguel must return to the land of the living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead. to do so, he must receive a blessing from his family that can undo the curse placed upon him by stealing ernesto's guitar, using an aztec marigold petal. imelda offers miguel a blessing on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits. miguel accepts and lands right back at ernesto's tomb. but then miguel steals the guitar again to play at the plaza and lands right back in the land of the dead.\nmiguel refuses to accept imelda's condition and attempts to seek ernesto's blessing (as he believes that ernesto was the one married to imelda). miguel encounters hector (gael garcia bernal), a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played with ernesto and offers to help miguel reach him. in return, hector asks miguel to take his photo back to the land of the living so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him, which would cause him to fade from existence. hector attempts to return miguel to his relatives, but miguel escapes. miguel sneaks into ernesto's mansion and is welcomed by a surprised ernesto. ernesto welcomes miguel as his descendant, but hector confronts them, imploring miguel to take his photo. hector accuses ernesto of stealing his songs. as the two argue, miguel slowly pieces together the truth: ernesto and héctor were once a musical act on the brink of fame until hector grew homesick and tried to leave. unable to write songs himself, ernesto poisoned héctor and stole his guitar and songs to pass off as his own.\nernesto steals hector's photo and has him and miguel thrown into a cenote pit. there, hector reveals that his daughter is named coco, thus making him miguel's actual great-great-grandfather. coco is the only living person who still remembers him. with the help of dante - who now appears as an alebrije - the dead riveras find and rescue them. miguel explains that hector's death was the result of his decision to return home to her and coco, and imelda and hector reconcile. they infiltrate ernesto's sunrise concert to retrieve hector's photo from ernesto and reveal him as a fraud to the crowd. ernesto is crushed by a falling bell, just as he was in life, but the photo is destroyed once it reaches the water. as the sun rises, hector is in danger of being forgotten and disappearing. imelda blesses miguel without conditions so he can return to the land of the living. back home, miguel apologizes to his family for running away and plays \"remember me\" on hector's guitar, brightening coco to sing with him. she shares that she kept the torn piece of the photo with hector's face, then tells her family stories about her father, preserving his memory and existence in the land of the dead. miguel reconciles with his family and the ban on music is finally lifted. one year later, miguel shows his new baby sister, socorro, the family ofrenda, now displaying photos of hector and the recently deceased coco. coco's collected letters from hector prove ernesto's theft of his songs, leading to ernesto's disgrace and hector's rightful recognition. in the land of the dead, hector joins imelda, coco, and their family to visit the living world. miguel performs a heartfelt song for his living and dead relatives."

      "plot_summary": "In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, matriarch Imelda Rivera banned music after her husband left the family to pursue a musician's life; she and Coco turn to shoemaking and keep ancestor photos on the family ofrenda. Ninety-six years later, 12-year-old Miguel Rivera (living with his parents, grandmother Abuelita, and great-grandmother Coco) secretly learns guitar and idolizes deceased star Ernesto de la Cruz. On Día de los Muertos Miguel discovers a torn family photograph that suggests Ernesto once owned the Rivera guitar; when Abuelita destroys Miguel's homemade guitar he runs off to the town plaza. Believing Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel breaks into Ernesto's tomb and steals Ernesto's famous guitar. Strumming it renders him invisible to the living and drags him, with his dog Dante, into the Land of the Dead where skeleton ancestors from his family arrive to meet the living. Miguel learns he has been cursed for stealing from the dead and must get a living family blessing before sunrise or remain dead; Imelda offers a blessing only if he renounces music, which he accepts briefly but then steals Ernesto's guitar again and returns to the Land of the Dead.\n\nThere Miguel meets Héctor Rivera, a charming, impoverished skeleton who claims to have been Ernesto's former partner and offers to guide Miguel to Ernesto in exchange for Miguel taking Héctor's photo back to the living world so Héctor's daughter will remember him. Miguel agrees and, with Héctor's help, sneaks into Ernesto's mansion. Héctor reveals he and Ernesto were a duo; Ernesto's songs were Héctor's. As Miguel pieces the past together, Héctor accuses Ernesto of stealing his songs and of poisoning him when Héctor tried to leave. Ernesto appears, welcomes Miguel as his supposed descendant, then betrays them: he steals Héctor's photo and has Héctor and Miguel thrown into a cenote pit.\n\nTrapped, Héctor confesses his daughter is Coco, making him Miguel's true great-great-grandfather; Coco kept a torn fragment of the photograph with Héctor's face. Dante, transformed into an alebrije spirit guide, helps the Rivera dead locate and rescue Miguel and Héctor. Back in the Land of the Dead the Riveras confront Ernesto during his sunrise concert; Miguel and the dead Riveras expose Ernesto's theft by producing Héctor's letters and evidence. Ernesto, fleeing, is struck and killed by a falling bell (mirroring his historical death); his photo is destroyed when it hits water so he cannot remain in the Land of the Dead. As sunlight approaches, Héctor begins to fade because living memory of him is threatened. Imelda unequivocally blesses Miguel using an aztec marigold petal so Miguel can return to the living and save Héctor's memory.\n\nMiguel wakes in the plaza with Héctor's photo returned. He apologizes to his family, plays Héctor's song \"Remember Me\" for Coco, who briefly sings and then recounts stories about her father; the family restores Héctor to the ofrenda and lifts the ban on music. One year later the family celebrates Día de los Muertos with new photos (including Héctor and the recently deceased Coco) on the ofrenda; Miguel, now with a baby sister Socorro, performs for both living and dead while Héctor rejoins Imelda and the Riveras in the Land of the Dead, properly remembered.",

    "synopsis": [
      "jesper (jason schwartzman) is the lazy and unambitious son of a postmaster general, who deliberately under-performs at his father's postal academy. jesper does not take the academy seriously and even undermines the authority of the drill sergeant (j. k. simmons) the assistant head of the johansen family's postal department who works under the royal postmaster general.\njesper had spent 9 months at the academy and learned nothing at all. jesper was not good at sorting / filing, carrier pigeon handling, transport of fragile merchandise, among other things. in a final effort to get his son to change his behavior, his father sends him to the distant island town of smeerensburg with the task of posting 6,000 letters in a year, and if he fails, he will be cut off from the family estate. that would be the end of jesper's privileged life, and he would end up in the gutter.\njesper travels by coach to the end of the mainland and the only way to get to smeerensburg is to take a ferry. the island is surrounded in fog, and it is miserably cold. once there, it becomes clear, as explained to jesper by the sarcastic, mischievous ferryman mogens (norm macdonald) and bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger alva (rashida jones), that the town's perpetually warring families, the ellingboes and the krums, and who comprise nearly all of the population, hardly exchange words, let alone letters. few months go by, without any letters at all.\nthe 2 families are in a constant state of war with each other and even the children are caught up in the frenzy and contribute to the animosity. alva resorted to selling fish as people didn't send their kids to school in town. now she is saving money to escape. the post office is a dilapidated structure, which is completely rotten and exposed to the elements, and jesper has a tough first night sleeping in the bitter cold with high winds. desperate to figure out a way to post letters from the town, jesper notices on the map in his office a far-off little establishment. there, he discovers a reclusive woodsman named klaus (j.k. simmons), with a house filled with handmade toys. terrified by the man's size and appearance, jesper flees, and leaves behind a drawing made by one of smeerensburg's children about his own home life. jesper prepares to escape the town when klaus comes to him, demanding to go to the house depicted in the drawing. there, klaus forces jesper to deliver a package to the boy inside-a toy. word of this event spreads to other children, who go to jesper the next day, thinking that, by sending letters to klaus, he will deliver a toy to them. jesper capitalizes on the idea and goes to klaus with the proposal of donating the toys in his house, to which klaus agrees provided the toys will be delivered at night so he can accompany jesper. news of the deeds quickly spreads, and more and more town children begin writing letters to klaus. the krum boy's toy leads him to play with an ellingboe girl, much to their clans' outrage. as more children write letters to klaus, jesper tells a boy who had earlier ridiculed him that klaus knows whenever any child misbehaves and only gives toys to good children. jesper says that klaus always knows when any child misbehaves, the acts of kindness they subsequently perform gradually inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their dispute. the children ask bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger alva to teach them to read and write so they can send letters. with her faith restored, alva uses her escape savings to reopen her school. eventually, jesper and klaus begin running out of toys to give to the children, and jesper suggests they make more in time for christmas. klaus initially refuses, but jasper happens upon a keepsake of klaus's late wife lydia, klaus forces him away.\nmotivated by márgu, a sami girl who can't write or speak in norwegian, jesper works with alva to help márgu write a letter asking for a sled, which he then attempts to build alone. seeing jesper's effort, klaus reconciles with him and the two finish the sled. while making the sled for the sami girl margu (neda margrethe labba) in a neighboring settlement, klaus tells jesper about his wife, lydia. he explains he made the toys to give to the future children that the couple never had, especially due to lydia's early passing. klaus realizes their work has been spreading joy to the children, and comes around to the christmas plan. márgu arrives with the rest of her people to help. as the town and jesper's relationship with alva flourish, jesper finds himself conflicted about whether to leave smeerensburg. meanwhile, family leaders mr. ellingboe (will sasso) and mrs. krum (joan cusack) form a temporary truce in order to stop jesper and klaus so that they can have the families resume their traditional feud. they eventually trick jesper's father into believing jesper had posted 14,000 letters. jesper's father arrives on christmas eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing the true reason he did everything he had since coming to smeerensburg to everyone. just before they leave town, jesper's father notices his son's remorse; after a private talk, he allows jesper to stay. when the 2 families heads go to destroy the christmas toys, jesper does everything he can to stop them and apparently fails, however, over the course of the resulting chase, mr. ellingboe's brutish daughter magdalone (sergio pablos) and mrs. krum's oafish son olaf (also pablos) fall in love, and thanks to alva having been informed by the children about their parents' plot, she and klaus had already replaced the toys in klaus' sleigh with wooden decoys. jesper's actions have redeemed him to klaus and alva, and they then deliver the christmas presents to the town. with jesper now redeemed, smeerensburg becomes a kind and happy town, with mr. ellingboe and mrs. krum being forced to end the families' feud due to the marriage of their children. jesper and klaus continue to deliver presents in smeerensburg and beyond for the next ten years. the year after that, klaus disappears, seemingly going to join his departed wife. jesper marries alva and they raise two children. he and klaus continue to deliver presents in smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. on the twelfth year, klaus mysteriously disappears. every subsequent christmas eve, jesper waits for klaus, who returns every year to deliver toys across the world."

      "plot_summary": "Jesper Johansen, the lazy son of the Royal Postmaster General, deliberately fails at the postal academy. To force responsibility, his father ships him to the fogbound, frozen island town of Smeerensburg and orders him to post 6,000 letters in one year or be cut off. Jesper arrives to find a hostile town dominated by two feuding families, the Ellingboes and the Krums, and a ruined post office. He struggles to get anyone to write and considers leaving. Local ferryman Mogens explains the town’s bitterness; former schoolteacher Alva Gunderson, now a fishmonger, distrusts Jesper but offers gruff help.\n\nSearching for ways to generate mail, Jesper discovers a map marking a remote cabin owned by Klaus, a solitary giant toymaker who lives in a forested clearing surrounded by a mountain of handcrafted toys. After a frightened first meeting, Jesper leaves behind a child’s drawing; Klaus returns to demand Jesper deliver a toy to the child in the picture. When Klaus secretly brings a toy and the child receives it, word spreads: children start writing letters to Klaus asking for toys. Jesper persuades Klaus to let him deliver the toys if Klaus accompanies him at night. Klaus agrees on the condition the visits remain secret.\n\nToys delivered to children from both families lead to cross-clan play (a Krums boy sharing a toy with an Ellingboe girl) and unsettle the feud. Jesper fabricates a story that Klaus only rewards good behavior to encourage better conduct. Alva, reassured by the renewed interest in learning, reopens her school and teaches children to read and write so they can send letters. Smeerensburg warms; neighbors begin small acts of generosity. Jesper and Klaus rapidly deplete Klaus’s stash of toys. Jesper, moved by Márgu, a Sami girl who cannot speak Norwegian, vows to help and—after finding a keepsake of Klaus’s late wife Lydia—tries to build a sled. Klaus initially lashes out but then reconciles with Jesper; together (with Márgu’s community) they craft a large sled and more toys.\n\nAs the holiday operation grows, the town leaders Mr. Ellingboe and Mrs. Krum conspire to sabotage Jesper’s work. They trick Jesper’s father into believing Jesper has already posted 14,000 letters; the elder Johansen arrives on Christmas Eve to praise him, exposing Jesper’s original punishment and humiliating him before the town. Jesper confesses remorse; his father, seeing genuine change, allows him to stay in Smeerensburg. The Ellingboes and Krums attempt to destroy Klaus’s sleigh full of toys, but Jesper, Alva, and Klaus race to stop them. During the confrontation, Ellingboe’s daughter Magdalone and Krum’s son Olaf fall in love, forcing the feuding families into a truce. Alva and Klaus had anticipated the attack and swapped real toys with wooden decoys, saving the gifts. Klaus, Jesper, and Alva complete the Christmas deliveries and the town’s culture shifts from hostility to community.\n\nOver the next years Jesper marries Alva; they raise two children while Jesper and Klaus keep delivering presents across Smeerensburg and beyond. After eleven years Klaus disappears mysteriously but returns each Christmas Eve to continue the tradition; his recurring departures and returns become the origin of the mythic Santa-like figure in Smeerensburg. The film ends with the town transformed, Jesper redeemed and rooted, and Klaus’s legacy of handmade toys and yearly gift-giving established as the new holiday tradition.",

    "synopsis": [
      "young carl fredricksen (ed asner) is a quiet bespectacled boy wearing an old pilot's cap and goggles who idolizes renowned explorer charles f. muntz (christopher plummer). he is saddened to learn, however, that muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant bird he had claimed to have discovered in paradise falls, venezuela, south america, and was fired. intent on proving them wrong, muntz is seen boarding his zeppelin called the spirit of adventure, with his team of dogs and promises to return once he has brought back living proof of his find. the zeppelin was designed by muntz himself, and has all the comforts of modern life, including a doggy bath and a mechanical dog walker. one day, carl befriends an energetic and somewhat eccentric tomboy named ellie, who is also a muntz fan. ellie invites carl to join her club, and to commemorate the occasion she gives him a grape soda bottle cap as a badge. ellie is the outspoken, adventurous type, who pushes carl out of his comfort zone to try new adventures. she confides to carl her desire to move her \"clubhouse\", an abandoned house in the neighborhood, to a cliff overlooking paradise falls, making him promise to help her. carl and ellie eventually get married and grow old together in the restored house, working as a toy balloon vendor and a zookeeper, respectively. carl and ellie make a beautiful life together, spending time with each other and enjoying nature. ellie suffers a miscarriage, and it is implied that she is infertile. when they are told by a doctor that they are unable to have children, they save for a trip to paradise falls but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs like a new car tire, carl's accident (which caused a leg fracture), house repairs when a tree fell on it during a storm and so on.\nmany years later, a now elderly carl decides to surprise ellie with tickets to south america, but she falls ill and is hospitalized, giving carl her scrapbook before dying soon after. now in his late 70s, carl holds out while the neighborhood around him is redeveloped. he refuses to sell. he ends up injuring a construction worker over damage done to his mailbox. he is evicted from the house by court order due to being deemed a \"public menace\" and is ordered to move to a retirement home. however, carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to ellie. workers from shady oaks retirement home arrive to pick him up the following morning but are shocked to find carl releasing millions of helium balloons into the air which detach his house from its foundation, lifting it over the city and into the sky. he turns his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons to lift it off its foundation. he uses curtains as sails and the wind pane as a rudder to control direction and speed. carl sets a course for south america. a 13 year young member of the \"wilderness explorers\", tribe 54, sweat lodge 12 (a youth organization) named russell (jordan nagai) becomes an accidental passenger, having pestered carl earlier in an attempt to earn his final merit badge, \"assisting the elderly\". russell was missing this last badge to become a senior wilderness explorer. carl has asked russell to find a snipe that had been bothering him, and russell had come over to provide a progress report when carl unfurled the balloons. russell was stuck on the front porch of the house.\ncarl lets him in and decides to descend to return russell home before a severe storm hits. after surviving a thunderstorm, the house lands near a large ravine facing paradise falls. carl releases some balloons to descend but they hit ground early and are knocked out of the house. they manage to hold onto it using a hose attached to the porch while the fog lifts to reveal that they are standing on a high plateau opposite paradise falls. unable to climb back into the house, carl and russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it around the ravine, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. meanwhile, a chase is progressing in the jungle. three dogs with red lights on their collars are in hot pursuit of what appears to be a giant bird, but they lose the trail when their sensitive ears pick up the fine tuning of carl's hearing aid. carl and russell later befriend a tall, colorful flightless bird (whom russell names \"kevin\") trying to reach her chicks, and then a dog named dug (bob peterson), whose collar has a device that translates his thoughts into human speech. after failed attempts to evade the animals, carl reluctantly allows both to join the party. kevin loudly calls out and is answered by smaller calls. dug says that kevin is calling to her babies, and russell realizes that kevin is a girl. meanwhile, the three dogs seen chasing the bird earlier have picked up the scent of carl and russell, who they nickname the mailman. the leader alpha (bob peterson), a doberman pinscher, tells beta (delroy lindo), a rottweiler, and gamma (jerome ranft), a bulldog, that they must be vigilant and continue their search. alpha had sent dug on a fools errand to keep him occupied, but when he turns on the collar communication device, alpha realizes that dug has found the bird and is with carl and russell. alpha turns on the tracking beacon on dug's collar to find his position.\ncarl and russell encounter the pack of dogs led by alpha, but kevin has already run off. they are taken to dug's master, who turns out to be elderly 92 years old charles muntz. muntz invites carl and russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains that he has spent the years since his disgrace searching paradise falls for the giant bird. the zeppelin is anchored inside a large and tall cave, where mintz lives with his dogs. the dogs serve muntz and even do his cooking for him. carl's initial excitement over meeting his hero fades as he becomes aware that muntz's obsession has driven him insane. after muntz shows them the bird skeleton, russell notes its resemblance to kevin. muntz says that he has tried to smoke the bird out of its habitat, but sometimes years go by between sightings. the bird's habitat is a labyrinth, which has no way out and muntz has already lost many dogs in the process.\nwhen russell innocently reveals his friendship with kevin (indicating that he attracted the bird with chocolate), muntz becomes disturbingly hostile. muntz reveals that he has murdered other travelers he suspected of also seeking the bird. muntz reveals a table of head mannequins wearing various headgear and grimly knocks each one off with his cane as he describes the stories their wearers told him (a surveyor making a map, a botanist making a catalog of the plants); claiming that each one was actually after his bird.\nthis is when kevin enters the cave and gives out a call, distracting muntz. this gives an opportunity to carl and russel to run out of the zeppelin.\nthis prompts carl, russell, kevin and dug to flee, chased by muntz's dogs. riding on kevin's back and assisted by dug, who calls carl his new master, they barely escape capture by muntz's dogs, though kevin is injured in the process. hearing kevin call out to her chicks, carl agrees to take her home. just before kevin can re-enter her labyrinth home, a net flies out and captures her. muntz and his dogs have arrived in the zeppelin, led to the spot by a tracking device on dug's collar.\nmuntz eventually catches up with them and starts a fire beneath carl's house, forcing carl to choose between saving his home or kevin. carl rushes to put out the fire, allowing muntz to take the bird. carl and russell eventually reach the falls, but russell is angry with carl. settling into his home, carl discovers photos of their married life in ellie's childhood scrapbook and a final note from his wife thanking him for the \"adventure\" and encouraging him to go on a new one. reinvigorated, he goes to find russell, only to see him sailing off on some balloons to rescue kevin. carl empties the house of his furniture and possessions and pursues him. russell is captured by muntz, but carl boards the dirigible in flight and frees both russell and kevin. muntz pursues them around the airship, finally cornering dug, kevin, and russell inside carl's tethered house. carl lures kevin out through a window and back onto the airship with dug and russell clinging to her back, just as muntz is about to close in, muntz leaps after them, only to snag his foot on some balloon lines and fall to his death. snapped from its tether, the house descends out of sight through the clouds, which carl accepts as being for the best. carl, russell and dug reunite kevin with her chicks, then fly the dirigible back to the city. when russell's father misses his son's senior explorer ceremony, carl proudly presents russell with his final badge for assisting the elderly, as well as a personal addition: the grape soda cap that ellie gave to carl when they first met (which he dubs the \"ellie badge\"). meanwhile, carl's house is shown to have landed on the cliff beside paradise falls, as promised to ellie.\na series of photographs shows carl enjoying his latest adventure: living an active life as a surrogate grandfather to russell."

      "plot_summary": "Young Carl Fredricksen idolizes explorer Charles F. Muntz and befriends Ellie, who dreams of moving their neighborhood house to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls in Venezuela. Carl and Ellie marry, restore the house, save for a trip to Paradise Falls but repeatedly spend the money on emergencies, and after Ellie dies she gives Carl her adventure scrapbook and the grape-soda-bottle-cap \"Ellie badge.\" Decades later, developers surround Carl's house and he is declared a public menace after injuring a construction worker; ordered to move to Shady Oaks Retirement Home, Carl instead ties thousands of helium balloons to his house and lifts it into the sky to fulfill his promise to Ellie. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell accidentally becomes a stowaway while trying to earn his final merit badge, \"Assisting the Elderly.\" During a storm the house is blown off course and lands on a plateau across the ravine from Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the house and trek around the ravine. In the jungle they encounter a giant colorful flightless bird Russell names Kevin and a golden retriever-like dog, Dug, wearing a collar that translates thought into speech. They are pursued by a pack of dogs led by Alpha, who track Dug's collar beacon. The pack leads them to Charles Muntz's enormous dirigible anchored in a cavern; Muntz, now obsessed and paranoid after being disgraced for a claimed giant-bird discovery, keeps a team of trained dogs and is desperate to capture living proof of the bird. Muntz initially appears welcoming but, after Russell reveals his friendship with Kevin, Muntz grows hostile—he has murdered other hunters he suspected of seeking the bird—and imprisons them. Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin escape into the jungle but Muntz's dogs recapture Kevin in a net. Muntz attacks Carl's house, setting a fire beneath it; he captures Kevin while Carl fights the blaze. At Paradise Falls Carl reads Ellie's final scrapbook note thanking him for the \"adventure\" and encouraging a new one; reinvigorated, he pursues Muntz by releasing his house's furniture as ballast and follows in a makeshift balloon pursuit. Russell is captured aboard Muntz's airship; Carl boards the dirigible mid-flight, frees Russell and Kevin, and a confrontation ensues. Muntz pursues them, becomes entangled in Carl's balloon rigging and falls to his death. The house is ripped from its tether and descends out of sight; Carl accepts its loss. Carl, Russell and Dug return Kevin to her chicks in the Paradise Falls plateau, then fly Muntz's dirigible back to the city. Carl presents Russell with his final Wilderness Explorer badge and gives him the Ellie grape-soda cap as the \"Ellie badge.\" The house is later shown settled on the cliff beside Paradise Falls as promised, and a photo montage shows Carl living a fuller life as a surrogate grandfather to Russell.",

    "synopsis": [
      "shan yu (miguel ferrer) is a hun & attacks china after the emperor builds the great wall. general shigeta is in charge of defenses. shan yu has already crossed the northern borders when the news reaches the royal court. chi-fu (james hong) is the emperor's adviser and assistant.\nin the imperial city, the emperor (pat morita) orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the imperial chinese army. mulan (ming-na wen) is a tom boyish village girl who fails at finding herself a good husband. mulan is expected to be quiet, graceful, polite, punctual and demure. mulan has a pet horse khan (frank welker) and cricket cri-kee (frank welker). she is arranged to meet a matchmaker (miriam margolyes) to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. fa-zhou (soon-tek oh) prays to the ancestors to help mulan impress the matchmaker and bring honor to the family. fa li (freda foh shen) is her mother and her grandmother fa (june foray). in these times women bring honor to their family by getting married to a suitable groom and giving birth to boys, who can serve the emperor. women are only expected to conduct house chores and look beautiful. mulan is bathed and dressed up for her meeting with the matchmaker. grandmother fa adds cri-kee to mulan's outfit for extra luck. following a few mishaps (mulan had taken notes on her hand, and when the matchmaker holds her arm the ink is transferred to her palm and from there to the matchmaker's face. then cri-kee gets into the matchmakers dress, and she falls on hot coals), the matchmaker deems her a disgrace to the family. mulan is heartbroken and know that if she is herself, she will never bring honor to her family. fa-zhou consoles mulan and says that she is just a late bloomer and when her time comes, she will bring honor to the family. mulan's father fa zhou is summoned by imperial army to serve the emperor against the huns. fa zhou is old and has a limp in his leg (but he would not even consider not going as that would mean dishonor for the family for generations), so mulan goes instead, dressed as a man. mulan takes fa-zhou's orders, his sword and armor and rides away on khan. when her absence is discovered, fa-zhou refuses to go after her, as if mulan is found impersonating a man, she will be killed. mulan's grandmother prays to the family's ancestors (mary kay bergman) for mulan's safety. in the local temple, mushu (eddie murphy), a small red dragon, is a disgraced former family guardian who is demoted to the role of awakening the spirits of the ancestors. mushu was demoted when he was sent to protect fa-deng and his misguidance led to disaster, with fa-deng being decapitated.\nthe ancestors argue whether mulan's actions are right or not, and the ancestors are split in 2 camps on the issue. the great ancestor (george takei) decides that the powerful stone dragon guardian should guide mulan; and sends mushu to wake him. after accidentally destroying the guardian's statue, mushu travels to mulan's aid himself (after cri-kee talks to mushu and gives him this idea), desiring to redeem himself to the ancestors by making mulan a war hero. cri-kee decides to travel with mushu, just to make sure that he doesn't get mulan in trouble. as china continues to prepare for war, shan yu and the huns are riding quickly through the wilderness toward the city. shan-yu sets fire to all the villages in his path. he has an eagle that soars above the battlefield and informs shan-yu of any unseen dangers. hun soldiers capture two imperial scouts, and shan yu tauntingly instructs them to tell the emperor to send his finest troops to battle the huns. reasoning that it only takes one man to deliver a message, shan yu has one of the scouts executed.\nmeanwhile mulan is practicing how to be a man, just outside the army camp where she is supposed to report. mushu links up with mulan (mulan is not convinced that her ancestors send her a little lizard to help her) & devises a plan to make mulan a war hero to restore her family's honor & secure his own place as the guardian of ancestral temple. mushu teaches mulan to walk and talk like a man.\nmulan meets fellow soldiers yao (harvey fierstein), chien-po (jerry tondo), and ling (gedde watanabe). mushu's advise of hitting men and slapping their behinds only leads to a brawl and mulan barely manages to escape.\ncaptain li shang (bd wong) is general shigeta's son & in charge of training. general shigeta takes the trained soldiers to stop shan yu at a pass, and leaves li shang in charge of the camp. shigeta argues that li shang was at the top of his class, is well versed in military techniques and has an impressive military lineage, and so is the right person for the post. chi-fu is not happy with li shang's appointment and promises to keep a close eye on him for any mistakes.\nli shang has a tough assignment on his hands to train the troops as they are totally undisciplined. mulan gives her name as ping and says that ping is fa-zhou's son. chi-fu believes this as \"ping\" is clumsy and awkward.\nthe remaining soldiers turn against ping as li shang punishes them for ping's mistakes and make him sleep outside of their camp. li shang starts training the troops. their first task is to retrieve an arrow from the top of a tall mast, by wearing 2 heavy weights in their wrists. yao and his buddies continue to undermine \"ping\" by tripping him or putting insects down his shirt.\nat first mulan is clumsy & disgraceful. mushu helps mulan cheat and pass the tests, but she is often caught by li shang. slowly mulan learns all the skills & surpasses all fellow soldiers at the defense arts. mulan is the first to retrieve the arrow from the top of the mast. with time, the other soldiers accept \"ping\" as their friend and comrade.\nthe guys enter the lake when mulan was bathing there, and she is trapped. she is only able to get away when mushu bites one of the men and they believe that there is a snake in the lake. the confusion and chaos allow mulan to escape with khan's help. shan yu attacks the village that general shigeta is defending as he already knew from his eagle that an ambush was set up for him. though the soldiers have successfully completed training, but army supervisor chi fu (james fong) is skeptical of the progress captain li has made and declares that in his report he will mark the troops as unfit for battle. mushu also finds that mulan is attracted to li shang.\nmushu, afraid of losing the plot fakes a letter to chi fu from general shigeta requesting all available troops at the front line. the ruse works, and shang marches the troops out of camp the following day.\non their march, the guys dream of becoming a hero and marrying a beautiful girl. but nobody wants a girl with a brain and one who speaks her own mind. li shang's troops arrive at the village to find the army destroyed & shigeta dead. li decides to pursue shan yu before he gets to the imperial city.\nwhile pursuing, mushu accidentally sets off a cannon giving away li's position in the mountain pass. li shang's men use their cannons to attack the archers atop the mountain, but li shang asks them to save the last cannon. when the cannons are exhausted, shan yu attacks with his huge army. as the soldiers march up a mountain pass, they are ambushed by the huns. mulan cleverly uses the last huolongchushui cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries the entire hun army. shan yu is himself buried in the resultant avalanche.\nmulan and khan risk their own lives to save li shang from being swept away in the avalanche. li shang's soldiers survive by hiding behind a rock and the avalanche tides over it. angered, shan yu wounds mulan during the battle, and her deception is revealed to li shang when the wound is bandaged. instead of executing mulan as the law requires, li shang spares her life (he says that his debt to her repaid by sparing her life, in exchanging for saving his) and expels her from the army. mulan is left behind as the other soldiers depart for the imperial city to report the huns' defeat. mulan miserably tells mushu that entering the army was a mistake, and that she was fated to dishonor her family. mushu finally admits that he was not sent by the ancestors, and that his mission was a selfish one to get his job back. even cri-kee confesses that he is not a truly lucky cricket.\nmushu consoles mulan and says that things will work out. he counsels her to return him and face her father.\nhowever, shan yu and several of his warriors have survived, and mulan sees them heading towards the city. in the city, captain shang and his troops are being hailed as heroes for defeating the huns. though surrounded by cheering citizens, shang, yao, ling, and chein-po are noticeably dejected. mulan enters the city and warns li shang, but he ignores her. mulan begs the other citizens to take notice of the danger, but they all ignore mulan as she is a girl.\nthe huns then secretly enter the city (being part of the victory parade), capture the emperor and seize the palace. knowing of mulan's knack for creative problem-solving, shang, yao, ling, and chien-po turn to her for a rescue plan. with all except shang disguising themselves as concubines, they infiltrate the palace and attack the huns guarding the chamber into which the emperor was taken. shan yu threatens to kill the emperor if he refuses to bow to him and accept him as the new leader of china. the emperor stoically refuses and shan yu prepares to strike, but shang leaps into action just in time. as shang and shan yu battle, chien-po carries the emperor to safety. mulan then attracts shan yu's attention by proving herself to be the soldier who started the avalanche, luring him to the roof of the palace for a final fight. mushu, armed with an enormous firework rocket, launches himself at shan yu. as the hun leader is blasted to smithereens in a colorful display, mulan and mushu drop to safety on the palace steps. as the chaos subsides, chi fu berates mulan for her actions. shang angrily defends her until the emperor appears. he explains to mulan that, despite her fraud, she has saved the entire nation of china. in the ultimate display of respect, the emperor bows to mulan, as do the countless people in the attending crowd. he then offers mulan a place in his council (to the shock of chi fu), but mulan respectfully declines and expresses her wish to return home. the emperor gives her his medallion and shan yu's sword as gifts to honor the fa family. back at the fa estate, fa zhou is overjoyed at the return of his daughter. though mulan presents him with the emperor's crest and the sword of shan yu, he casts the priceless gifts aside and embraces her, assuring her that she herself is the greatest honor to their family. captain shang arrives soon afterward, returning the helmet that mulan left behind, and awkwardly but happily accepts mulan's invitation to stay for dinner. mushu, at last, is restored to guardian status in the family temple. mulan thanks him for his help in her adventurous plan, and the ancestors celebrate that the fa family is complete again."

      "plot_summary": "When Huns under Shan Yu invade northern China, the Emperor orders one man from each family conscripted. In the Fa household, elderly Fa Zhou is summoned despite a war wound; to spare him, his daughter Mulan disguises herself as a man, takes his armor and horse Khan, and leaves for the army camp. At home the ancestors debate Mulan’s choice; the disgraced tiny dragon Mushu is sent (by accident after destroying the stone guardian) to ‘wake’ the family guardian but instead follows Mulan to win back his status. Mushu and the lucky cricket Cri-Kee accompany Mulan as she reports to Captain Li Shang’s training camp under the name “Ping.”\n\nMulan struggles to act like a soldier and initially embarrasses herself in front of the recruits Yao, Ling and Chien-Po and Captain Li Shang, but with Mushu’s scheming and Mulan’s ingenuity she learns battlefield skills, retrieves the training arrow, and earns her comrades’ respect. Chi-Fu, the Emperor’s advisor, doubts Li Shang’s command and reports the troops unfit; Mushu forges a false summons that sends Li Shang and the company north to confront Shan Yu.\n\nAt the mountain pass Mulan’s quick thinking uses the huolongchushui cannon to trigger an avalanche that buries Shan Yu’s army; Li Shang is saved from an avalanche by Mulan and Khan, but Mulan is wounded. When medics tend her wound they discover she is female. Li Shang spares her from execution but expels her; the company marches on to the imperial city believing the Huns defeated. Mushu confesses he lied about being sent by the ancestors, and Cri-Kee admits he isn’t magically lucky.\n\nShan Yu and several Huns survived and infiltrate the victory procession into the imperial city, capture the Emperor and seize the palace. Mulan returns to warn Li Shang, who initially dismisses her because she is a woman. Mulan persuades Li Shang’s former comrades to follow her; they infiltrate the palace dungeon disguised as concubines and rescue the Emperor. Mulan lures Shan Yu to the palace roof for a final confrontation. During the rooftop fight Mushu launches a large firework that causes Shan Yu to be blasted and fall to his death. With the Emperor rescued and Shan Yu defeated, Chi-Fu berates Mulan for deceit, but the Emperor honors her: he offers her a post on his council and presents her the imperial crest and Shan Yu’s sword. Mulan declines the official position and returns home to the Fa estate. Fa Zhou rejects the material honors and embraces Mulan, declaring she is the family’s greatest honor. Captain Li Shang arrives to return Mulan’s helmet; he accepts her dinner invitation. Mushu is restored as the Fa family guardian in the ancestral temple.",

      "shan yu (miguel ferrer) is a hun & attacks china after the emperor builds the great wall. general shigeta is in charge of defenses. shan yu has already crossed the northern borders when the news reaches the royal court. chi-fu (james hong) is the emperor's adviser and assistant.\nin the imperial city, the emperor (pat morita) orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the imperial chinese army. mulan (ming-na wen) is a tom boyish village girl who fails at finding herself a good husband. mulan is expected to be quiet, graceful, polite, punctual and demure. mulan has a pet horse khan (frank welker) and cricket cri-kee (frank welker). she is arranged to meet a matchmaker (miriam margolyes) to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. fa-zhou (soon-tek oh) prays to the ancestors to help mulan impress the matchmaker and bring honor to the family. fa li (freda foh shen) is her mother and her grandmother fa (june foray). in these times women bring honor to their family by getting married to a suitable groom and giving birth to boys, who can serve the emperor. women are only expected to conduct house chores and look beautiful. mulan is bathed and dressed up for her meeting with the matchmaker. grandmother fa adds cri-kee to mulan's outfit for extra luck. following a few mishaps (mulan had taken notes on her hand, and when the matchmaker holds her arm the ink is transferred to her palm and from there to the matchmaker's face. then cri-kee gets into the matchmakers dress, and she falls on hot coals), the matchmaker deems her a disgrace to the family. mulan is heartbroken and know that if she is herself, she will never bring honor to her family. fa-zhou consoles mulan and says that she is just a late bloomer and when her time comes, she will bring honor to the family. mulan's father fa zhou is summoned by imperial army to serve the emperor against the huns. fa zhou is old and has a limp in his leg (but he would not even consider not going as that would mean dishonor for the family for generations), so mulan goes instead, dressed as a man. mulan takes fa-zhou's orders, his sword and armor and rides away on khan. when her absence is discovered, fa-zhou refuses to go after her, as if mulan is found impersonating a man, she will be killed. mulan's grandmother prays to the family's ancestors (mary kay bergman) for mulan's safety. in the local temple, mushu (eddie murphy), a small red dragon, is a disgraced former family guardian who is demoted to the role of awakening the spirits of the ancestors. mushu was demoted when he was sent to protect fa-deng and his misguidance led to disaster, with fa-deng being decapitated.\nthe ancestors argue whether mulan's actions are right or not, and the ancestors are split in 2 camps on the issue. the great ancestor (george takei) decides that the powerful stone dragon guardian should guide mulan; and sends mushu to wake him. after accidentally destroying the guardian's statue, mushu travels to mulan's aid himself (after cri-kee talks to mushu and gives him this idea), desiring to redeem himself to the ancestors by making mulan a war hero. cri-kee decides to travel with mushu, just to make sure that he doesn't get mulan in trouble. as china continues to prepare for war, shan yu and the huns are riding quickly through the wilderness toward the city. shan-yu sets fire to all the villages in his path. he has an eagle that soars above the battlefield and informs shan-yu of any unseen dangers. hun soldiers capture two imperial scouts, and shan yu tauntingly instructs them to tell the emperor to send his finest troops to battle the huns. reasoning that it only takes one man to deliver a message, shan yu has one of the scouts executed.\nmeanwhile mulan is practicing how to be a man, just outside the army camp where she is supposed to report. mushu links up with mulan (mulan is not convinced that her ancestors send her a little lizard to help her) & devises a plan to make mulan a war hero to restore her family's honor & secure his own place as the guardian of ancestral temple. mushu teaches mulan to walk and talk like a man.\nmulan meets fellow soldiers yao (harvey fierstein), chien-po (jerry tondo), and ling (gedde watanabe). mushu's advise of hitting men and slapping their behinds only leads to a brawl and mulan barely manages to escape.\ncaptain li shang (bd wong) is general shigeta's son & in charge of training. general shigeta takes the trained soldiers to stop shan yu at a pass, and leaves li shang in charge of the camp. shigeta argues that li shang was at the top of his class, is well versed in military techniques and has an impressive military lineage, and so is the right person for the post. chi-fu is not happy with li shang's appointment and promises to keep a close eye on him for any mistakes.\nli shang has a tough assignment on his hands to train the troops as they are totally undisciplined. mulan gives her name as ping and says that ping is fa-zhou's son. chi-fu believes this as \"ping\" is clumsy and awkward.\nthe remaining soldiers turn against ping as li shang punishes them for ping's mistakes and make him sleep outside of their camp. li shang starts training the troops. their first task is to retrieve an arrow from the top of a tall mast, by wearing 2 heavy weights in their wrists. yao and his buddies continue to undermine \"ping\" by tripping him or putting insects down his shirt.\nat first mulan is clumsy & disgraceful. mushu helps mulan cheat and pass the tests, but she is often caught by li shang. slowly mulan learns all the skills & surpasses all fellow soldiers at the defense arts. mulan is the first to retrieve the arrow from the top of the mast. with time, the other soldiers accept \"ping\" as their friend and comrade.\nthe guys enter the lake when mulan was bathing there, and she is trapped. she is only able to get away when mushu bites one of the men and they believe that there is a snake in the lake. the confusion and chaos allow mulan to escape with khan's help. shan yu attacks the village that general shigeta is defending as he already knew from his eagle that an ambush was set up for him. though the soldiers have successfully completed training, but army supervisor chi fu (james fong) is skeptical of the progress captain li has made and declares that in his report he will mark the troops as unfit for battle. mushu also finds that mulan is attracted to li shang.\nmushu, afraid of losing the plot fakes a letter to chi fu from general shigeta requesting all available troops at the front line. the ruse works, and shang marches the troops out of camp the following day.\non their march, the guys dream of becoming a hero and marrying a beautiful girl. but nobody wants a girl with a brain and one who speaks her own mind. li shang's troops arrive at the village to find the army destroyed & shigeta dead. li decides to pursue shan yu before he gets to the imperial city.\nwhile pursuing, mushu accidentally sets off a cannon giving away li's position in the mountain pass. li shang's men use their cannons to attack the archers atop the mountain, but li shang asks them to save the last cannon. when the cannons are exhausted, shan yu attacks with his huge army. as the soldiers march up a mountain pass, they are ambushed by the huns. mulan cleverly uses the last huolongchushui cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries the entire hun army. shan yu is himself buried in the resultant avalanche.\nmulan and khan risk their own lives to save li shang from being swept away in the avalanche. li shang's soldiers survive by hiding behind a rock and the avalanche tides over it. angered, shan yu wounds mulan during the battle, and her deception is revealed to li shang when the wound is bandaged. instead of executing mulan as the law requires, li shang spares her life (he says that his debt to her repaid by sparing her life, in exchanging for saving his) and expels her from the army. mulan is left behind as the other soldiers depart for the imperial city to report the huns' defeat. mulan miserably tells mushu that entering the army was a mistake, and that she was fated to dishonor her family. mushu finally admits that he was not sent by the ancestors, and that his mission was a selfish one to get his job back. even cri-kee confesses that he is not a truly lucky cricket.\nmushu consoles mulan and says that things will work out. he counsels her to return him and face her father.\nhowever, shan yu and several of his warriors have survived, and mulan sees them heading towards the city. in the city, captain shang and his troops are being hailed as heroes for defeating the huns. though surrounded by cheering citizens, shang, yao, ling, and chein-po are noticeably dejected. mulan enters the city and warns li shang, but he ignores her. mulan begs the other citizens to take notice of the danger, but they all ignore mulan as she is a girl.\nthe huns then secretly enter the city (being part of the victory parade), capture the emperor and seize the palace. knowing of mulan's knack for creative problem-solving, shang, yao, ling, and chien-po turn to her for a rescue plan. with all except shang disguising themselves as concubines, they infiltrate the palace and attack the huns guarding the chamber into which the emperor was taken. shan yu threatens to kill the emperor if he refuses to bow to him and accept him as the new leader of china. the emperor stoically refuses and shan yu prepares to strike, but shang leaps into action just in time. as shang and shan yu battle, chien-po carries the emperor to safety. mulan then attracts shan yu's attention by proving herself to be the soldier who started the avalanche, luring him to the roof of the palace for a final fight. mushu, armed with an enormous firework rocket, launches himself at shan yu. as the hun leader is blasted to smithereens in a colorful display, mulan and mushu drop to safety on the palace steps. as the chaos subsides, chi fu berates mulan for her actions. shang angrily defends her until the emperor appears. he explains to mulan that, despite her fraud, she has saved the entire nation of china. in the ultimate display of respect, the emperor bows to mulan, as do the countless people in the attending crowd. he then offers mulan a place in his council (to the shock of chi fu), but mulan respectfully declines and expresses her wish to return home. the emperor gives her his medallion and shan yu's sword as gifts to honor the fa family. back at the fa estate, fa zhou is overjoyed at the return of his daughter. though mulan presents him with the emperor's crest and the sword of shan yu, he casts the priceless gifts aside and embraces her, assuring her that she herself is the greatest honor to their family. captain shang arrives soon afterward, returning the helmet that mulan left behind, and awkwardly but happily accepts mulan's invitation to stay for dinner. mushu, at last, is restored to guardian status in the family temple. mulan thanks him for his help in her adventurous plan, and the ancestors celebrate that the fa family is complete again."

    "synopsis": [
      "shrek, a grouchy, mean, selfish yet insecure green ogre that has always enjoyed living in peaceful solitude in his swamp, finds his life disrupted when numerous fairy-tale beings, including pinocchio, the three little pigs, and donkey, are forced into the swamp by order of the obsessive, perfectionist, fairy-tale despising lord farquaad. shrek leaves the swamp to ask farquaad for the return of his privacy, with his new friend donkey happily tagging along. meanwhile, farquaad tortures the gingerbread man into revealing the whereabouts of the remaining fairy-tale creatures until his guards rush in with an object farquaad has been searching for: the magic mirror. the mirror tells him that farquaad can only become a real king by marrying a princess (completely disregarding his original question regarding if his kingdom was the fairest of them all). the mirror gives him three princesses to choose from (in a parody of the dating game): cinderella, snow white, and princess fiona. farquaad chooses fiona and silences the mirror before he can mention \"the little thing that happens at night\" (which is later revealed to be a curse). shrek and donkey arrive at farquaad's palace in duloc, where they find themselves in the midst of a tournament. the winner will have the \"privilege\" of attempting to rescue fiona from a castle surrounded by lava and protected by a fire-breathing dragon so that farquaad may marry her. shrek (with some help from donkey) easily beats the other knights in a fashion that resembles a wrestling match and farquaad agrees to remove the fairy-tale creatures from the swamp if shrek rescues fiona. shrek and donkey travel to the castle and split up to find fiona. donkey encounters the dragon and sweet-talks the beast to save himself before discovering that the dragon is female. dragon takes a liking to donkey and carries him to her chambers. when shrek finds fiona, she is appalled at his lack of romanticism. as they are leaving, shrek manages to save donkey, caught in dragon's tender clutches, and causing her to become irate, chasing shrek, fiona, and donkey out of the castle. at first, fiona is thrilled to be rescued but quickly becomes disappointed when shrek takes his helmet off and she realizes that he is an ogre. the three make their return journey to farquaad's palace, with shrek and fiona finding that they have more in common with each other along the way and falling in love. however, at night, fiona refuses to camp with them, taking shelter in a nearby cave until morning. shrek and donkey stay awake and watch the stars while shrek informs donkey that he plans to build a 10-foot wall around his swamp when he returns. when donkey persistently asks shrek why he is doing this, shrek sadly confesses to him that everyone judges him before they get to know him. therefore, he feels he is better off alone, despite donkey's admittance that he did not immediately judge him when they first met. fiona hears this and decides to be kinder to shrek the next day. the next night, fiona takes shelter in a nearby windmill. when donkey hears strange noises coming from the windmill, he finds fiona has turned into an ogress. fiona explains she was cursed as a child and turns into an ogress every night, which is why she was locked away in the castle, and that only a kiss from her true love will return her to her \"love's true form\". shrek, about to confess his feelings for fiona, overhears part of their conversation, and is heartbroken as he misinterprets her disgust at her transformation into an \"ugly beast\" as being disgusted with him. fiona makes donkey promise not to tell shrek about the spell, vowing to do it herself, but when the next morning comes, shrek has brought lord farquaad to fiona. the two return to the castle, while a hurt shrek returns to the now-vacated swamp, not long after breaking off his friendship with donkey, out of anger. shrek finds that, despite his privacy, he is miserable and misses fiona. donkey comes to the swamp, angry at shrek and shrek reveals that he overheard their conversation. donkey keeps his promise to fiona and tells shrek that she was talking about someone else. he then tells him that fiona will be getting married shortly, urging shrek into action to gain fiona's true love. they are able to travel to duloc quickly, thanks to dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed donkey. they interrupt the wedding before farquaad can kiss fiona, but not before the sun sets, which causes fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. while her transformation causes shrek to fully understand what he overheard at the windmill, farquaad, disgusted over the change, orders shrek killed and fiona imprisoned, but shrek whistles for dragon, who bursts in and devours farquaad. shrek and fiona admit their love for each other and share a kiss; fiona is bathed in light as her curse is broken but is surprised to find that she has remained an ogress, as she thought she was supposed to become beautiful, to which shrek replies that she is beautiful.\nthe two of them get married in the swamp and depart on their honeymoon while the rest celebrate by singing \"i'm a believer\"."

      "shrek, a grouchy, mean, selfish yet insecure green ogre that has always enjoyed living in peaceful solitude in his swamp, finds his life disrupted when numerous fairy-tale beings, including pinocchio, the three little pigs, and donkey, are forced into the swamp by order of the obsessive, perfectionist, fairy-tale despising lord farquaad. shrek leaves the swamp to ask farquaad for the return of his privacy, with his new friend donkey happily tagging along. meanwhile, farquaad tortures the gingerbread man into revealing the whereabouts of the remaining fairy-tale creatures until his guards rush in with an object farquaad has been searching for: the magic mirror. the mirror tells him that farquaad can only become a real king by marrying a princess (completely disregarding his original question regarding if his kingdom was the fairest of them all). the mirror gives him three princesses to choose from (in a parody of the dating game): cinderella, snow white, and princess fiona. farquaad chooses fiona and silences the mirror before he can mention \"the little thing that happens at night\" (which is later revealed to be a curse). shrek and donkey arrive at farquaad's palace in duloc, where they find themselves in the midst of a tournament. the winner will have the \"privilege\" of attempting to rescue fiona from a castle surrounded by lava and protected by a fire-breathing dragon so that farquaad may marry her. shrek (with some help from donkey) easily beats the other knights in a fashion that resembles a wrestling match and farquaad agrees to remove the fairy-tale creatures from the swamp if shrek rescues fiona. shrek and donkey travel to the castle and split up to find fiona. donkey encounters the dragon and sweet-talks the beast to save himself before discovering that the dragon is female. dragon takes a liking to donkey and carries him to her chambers. when shrek finds fiona, she is appalled at his lack of romanticism. as they are leaving, shrek manages to save donkey, caught in dragon's tender clutches, and causing her to become irate, chasing shrek, fiona, and donkey out of the castle. at first, fiona is thrilled to be rescued but quickly becomes disappointed when shrek takes his helmet off and she realizes that he is an ogre. the three make their return journey to farquaad's palace, with shrek and fiona finding that they have more in common with each other along the way and falling in love. however, at night, fiona refuses to camp with them, taking shelter in a nearby cave until morning. shrek and donkey stay awake and watch the stars while shrek informs donkey that he plans to build a 10-foot wall around his swamp when he returns. when donkey persistently asks shrek why he is doing this, shrek sadly confesses to him that everyone judges him before they get to know him. therefore, he feels he is better off alone, despite donkey's admittance that he did not immediately judge him when they first met. fiona hears this and decides to be kinder to shrek the next day. the next night, fiona takes shelter in a nearby windmill. when donkey hears strange noises coming from the windmill, he finds fiona has turned into an ogress. fiona explains she was cursed as a child and turns into an ogress every night, which is why she was locked away in the castle, and that only a kiss from her true love will return her to her \"love's true form\". shrek, about to confess his feelings for fiona, overhears part of their conversation, and is heartbroken as he misinterprets her disgust at her transformation into an \"ugly beast\" as being disgusted with him. fiona makes donkey promise not to tell shrek about the spell, vowing to do it herself, but when the next morning comes, shrek has brought lord farquaad to fiona. the two return to the castle, while a hurt shrek returns to the now-vacated swamp, not long after breaking off his friendship with donkey, out of anger. shrek finds that, despite his privacy, he is miserable and misses fiona. donkey comes to the swamp, angry at shrek and shrek reveals that he overheard their conversation. donkey keeps his promise to fiona and tells shrek that she was talking about someone else. he then tells him that fiona will be getting married shortly, urging shrek into action to gain fiona's true love. they are able to travel to duloc quickly, thanks to dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed donkey. they interrupt the wedding before farquaad can kiss fiona, but not before the sun sets, which causes fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. while her transformation causes shrek to fully understand what he overheard at the windmill, farquaad, disgusted over the change, orders shrek killed and fiona imprisoned, but shrek whistles for dragon, who bursts in and devours farquaad. shrek and fiona admit their love for each other and share a kiss; fiona is bathed in light as her curse is broken but is surprised to find that she has remained an ogress, as she thought she was supposed to become beautiful, to which shrek replies that she is beautiful.\nthe two of them get married in the swamp and depart on their honeymoon while the rest celebrate by singing \"i'm a believer\"."

      "plot_summary": "At the North Pole, Santa Claus falls ill with a heavy cold. His doctor orders him to stay home and not make his annual Christmas Eve flight; when Santa protests the doctor says people no longer really believe in him. Discouraged, Santa decides to cancel Christmas. Mrs. Claus refuses to accept this and considers taking Santa's place. She summons two elves, Jingle and Jangle Bells, and asks them to find proof that people still care about Santa and the Christmas spirit. The elves take Vixen and head south toward Southtown, USA. Santa suspects Mrs. Claus is scheming and follows on Dasher. En route, Jingle and Jangle encounter the Miser brothers: Snow Miser and Heat Miser argue and refuse to let the climate change for Southtown. Vixen escapes the Mises and the elves reach Southtown, where a policeman stops them, issues a ticket for riding a reindeer the wrong way and wearing strange clothes, and a cat chases Vixen, who is then seized by the dogcatcher. The elves talk to local children; most dismiss Santa as only for little kids. The elves lose Vixen to the pound. Santa, posing under a false name, visits the Thistlewhite household and meets Ignatius “Iggy” Thistlewhite, who shows concern for Vixen and for whether adults still believe in Santa. Learning Vixen is in the pound, Santa rescues her (Vixen is very sick) and returns to the North Pole with her and Dasher to get her warm. Iggy and the elves confront Southtown's mayor to demand Vixen's release. The skeptical mayor offers a bargain: if they can make it snow in Southtown, he will free Vixen and declare a national holiday for Santa. The elves, Mrs. Claus and Blitzen first visit Snow Miser, who says he cannot act in Southtown because Heat Miser controls it. They then visit Heat Miser, who resents Santa and refuses to let Snow Miser make it snow; the brothers haggle and refuse to yield. Mrs. Claus threatens to summon their mother, Mother Nature. Mother Nature convenes the Mises and brokers a compromise: Snow Miser will allow a snowstorm in Southtown in exchange for one spring day at the North Pole. The agreed snow falls in Southtown; the mayor honors his bargain, releases Vixen, and declares the holiday. Children and adults across the world decide to give Santa a holiday and send him gifts and letters; a girl tells Santa she'll have a \"blue Christmas\" without him. Santa, seeing evidence that goodness and belief still exist, recovers his spirit, dresses, and decides to carry out the Christmas Eve delivery after all.",

      "santa claus comes down sick, and the doctor tells him he needs to stay home and not deliver presents this year. when santa protests, the doctor says that no one even believes in him any more and it doesn't matter. over mrs. claus' objections, santa decides to cancel christmas. mrs. claus considers putting on the red suit and delivering the presents herself, and calls two elves, jingle and jangle bells, to help her. the elves don't see mrs. claus as a convincing replacement, and they move to plan b: finding someone in the world who really cares about santa. jingle and jangle take vixen and head south. santa accuses mrs. claus of being up to something, and she confesses to sending jingle and jangle on their errand. santa, worried that they will not complete their mission, follows them on dasher. before he can reach them, jingle and jangle run into the miser brothers, snow miser and heat miser. vixen is able to escape with the elves safely. when they reach town, they are pulled over by a policeman, who writes them a ticket for riding a vixen the wrong way on a one way street and wearing funny-looking suits on a sunday. they disguise vixen as a dog by putting socks over her antlers, but a cat chases her and the elves up a tree. meanwhile, santa interviews the policeman, who is lacking in christmas spirit. the elves discuss christmas with some children, who all claim they don't care if santa comes or not, and \"believing in santa claus is for little kids.\" they don't notice the dogcatcher taking vixen away. later, ignatius thistlewhite, one of the children, is found by santa. using a false name, he visits the thistlewhite home and mrs. thistlewhite gives him a hot drink to help with his sneezing. ignatius (iggy) asks if his father or santa believe in santa claus, and they both respond in the affirmative. iggy tells them that the elves' \"dog\" had been taken by the dog catcher, and santa rushes to save her. both iggy and the elves resolve to visit the mayor to get vixen back, but when the three of them meet with the mayor, he is disbelieving. he then proposes a bargain: if they can make it snow in southtown, he'll release vixen and give santa a national holiday. santa gets a very sick vixen released from the pound, and dasher takes them both home to the cool air of the north pole. the elves meet mrs. claus and blitzen on a rooftop and they all go to visit snow miser to see if he would be willing to make it snow in southtown. snow miser explains that southtown is under the control of his brother heat miser and without his permission he can't do anything, so off they go to heat miser. heat miser has a grudge against santa due to santa's prejudice against warm weather, and refuses to allow the snow unless snow miser is willing to turn over control of the north pole. they call snow miser on the hot line, but the brothers refuse to bargain. mrs. claus makes an ultimatum: if they cannot come to an agreement, she will go to see the miser brothers' mother, mother nature. mother nature calls the brothers to her and brokers a compromise: one spring day at the north pole in exchange for a snowstorm in southtown. santa brings vixen back to the north pole and puts her in his own bed. he falls asleep in his chair. the mayor of southtown gets a call from his wife reminding him to wear his galoshes - snow is falling in southtown. children around the world decide that not only are they giving santa a holiday, but they will send him presents as well. if they don't have anything to send, they write letters. one such letter from a little girl tells santa that she'll have a blue christmas without him. finally convinced that goodness still exists in the world, santa decides that he will deliver the presents after all."

    "synopsis": [
      "following a nuclear holocaust, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. max rockatansky (tom hardy), a survivor, is captured by the war boys, the army of the tyrannical immortan joe (hugh keays-byrne) and taken to joe's citadel. max is haunted by nightmares of a woman and a child that he failed to protect. at the citadel, max's hair is shaved, and his vital information is tattooed on his back. max tries to escape but realizes that he is being inside a cave system of a stump like mountain with sheer drops to the surface on all sides. designated a universal blood donor, max is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for a sick war boy called nux (nicholas hoult).\nmeanwhile, imperator furiosa (charlize theron), one of joe's lieutenants with one artificial arm, is sent in her armored truck to trade produce and water for petrol and ammunition with two of his allies, the bullet farmer (richard carter) and the people eater (john howard) ruler of gas town.\njoe is an old man, who has blisters all over his body. he requires a special suit to protect his body and an oxygen mask that allows him to breathe. joe rules the population with an iron fist and controls them with limited release of water for consumption at periodic intervals. the water is stored in the mountain stump, and released for a few moments on orders of joe, for the teeming masses living below. when furiosa drives off-route, joe realizes that his five wives-women selected for breeding-are missing. joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farm. nux joins the pursuit with max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. meanwhile, furiosa's rig is attacked by buzzards in hostile territory. her own escort, who is not aware that furiosa has betrayed joe, helps her fight off the buzzards, but that's when joe and his forces catch up with furiosa.\na battle ensues between the truck and joe's forces. furiosa drives into a sandstorm, evading her pursuers, except nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the truck. max escapes and restrains nux, but the car is destroyed. after the storm, max sees furiosa repairing her truck, accompanied by the wives: capable (riley keough) the most level-headed and mature of the five, cheedo the fragile (courtney eaton) the meekest and most timid, toast the knowing (zoe kravitz) the most practical and intellectual of the five and is shown to have good knowledge of guns, the dag (abbey lee) an eccentric and bold personality, and the splendid angharad (rosie huntington-whiteley) joe's most \"treasured\" breeder, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with joe's child. max steals the truck, but its kill switch disables it. max begrudgingly agrees to help furiosa's group escape joe's wrath. nux sneaks onto the rig and attempts to kill furiosa, but the women overpower him and throw him out. nux who was left behind, is picked up by joe's army. furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon to barter a deal for safe passage. however, with joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block joe. joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the rig. he sends nux to carjack the rig.\nmax and furiosa fight pursuing bikers as joe's car, with nux now on board, surmounts the blockade and eventually attacks furiosa's truck, allowing nux to board. however, as the truck escapes, angharad falls off in an attempt to protect max and is run over by joe's car, mortally wounding her and her child. furiosa explains to max that they are escaping to the \"green place\", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. capable finds nux hiding in the truck, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. that night, the truck gets stuck in mud. furiosa and max slow joe's forces with mines, but joe's ally, the bullet farmer (richard carter), continues pursuing them. nux helps max free the truck while furiosa shoots and blinds the bullet farmer. max walks into the dark to confront the bullet farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition. moved by capable's compassion, nux joins the group and helps get the rig moving again. they drive the truck overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. max suspects a trap, but furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. the naked woman summons her clan, the vuvalini, who recognize furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the green place, now inhospitable. the vulvalini include the valkyrie (megan gale), the keeper of the seeds (melissa jaffer) and others (melita jurisic, gillian jones, joy smithers, antoinette kellerman, and christina koch). the group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended citadel, which has ample water and greenery that joe keeps for himself, and trap joe and his army in the bikers' canyon. the group heads back to the citadel, but they are attacked on route by joe's forces, and furiosa is seriously wounded. joe positions his car in front of the truck to slow it, while max fights joe's giant son, rictus erectus (nathan jones). joe captures toast, but she distracts him long enough for furiosa to rip off his breathing mask, killing him. nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the truck, killing rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing max, furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini to successfully escape in joe's car, where max transfuses his blood to furiosa to help her survive her injuries. at the citadel, the impoverished citizens are overjoyed at the sight of joe's corpse. furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the war boys, but max walks away, sharing a glance with furiosa before disappearing into the crowd."

      "plot_summary": "Following a global collapse the wasteland is dominated by the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe. Max Rockatansky is captured by Joe's War Boys, shaved, tattooed with vital info and designated a blood donor for the sick War Boy Nux. Imperator Furiosa, Joe's lieutenant with a mechanical arm, loads a War Rig in the Citadel and secretly drives off-route, abducting Joe's five breeding wives — Angharad (pregnant), Capable, Toast, The Dag and Cheedo — intending to take them to the “Green Place,” her remembered childhood homeland. Joe discovers the escape and launches a massive pursuit, calling in allies the Bullet Farmer and the People Eater and mustering the War Boys and his fanatical followers.\n\nDuring the chase Furiosa runs through a sandstorm that disables some pursuers; Nux, with Max strapped to his vehicle as a blood bag, survives and later boards the War Rig. Max escapes his restraints during the storm and confronts Furiosa; after initial hostility and Furiosa disabling the truck to prevent theft, Max reluctantly agrees to help when circumstances force cooperation. Nux attempts to kill Furiosa but is thrown from the rig and left behind; later he rejoins the pursuit.\n\nThe group crosses hostile territory and fights a biker tribe in a canyon; Joe breaches the biker blockade in a massive war vehicle and Rictus Erectus leads frontal attacks. During one clash Angharad falls from the rig and is crushed along with her unborn child. Furiosa reveals her plan to reach the Green Place. The War Rig becomes bogged in mud; Max and Furiosa sabotage pursuers with mines and traps, and Max retrieves weapons from the Bullet Farmer's men after a nighttime raid. Moved by Capable's kindness, Nux switches sides and helps free the rig.\n\nThey reach the swampland Furiosa remembers and encounter the Vuvalini — a clan of older female survivors who recognize Furiosa as a child abducted from them. The Vuvalini confirm that the Green Place is dead and desolate. Furiosa and the group decide instead to return to the Citadel, which holds water reserves and vegetation Joe hoards. Max initially intends to leave but, haunted by visions of a little girl he once failed to protect, he commits to the plan: lure Joe back into the biker canyon and retake the Citadel.\n\nOn the return the convoy is ambushed repeatedly. Furiosa is grievously wounded. Joe drives his vehicle to block and slow the rig while Rictus fights Max. Toast sacrifices herself to distract Joe long enough for Furiosa to rip off his breathing apparatus, killing him. Nux detonates himself by ramming the rig into a rock face, destroying the pursuing vehicles, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon exit to trap Joe's forces. With Joe dead and the road clear, Max transfuses his blood to the dying Furiosa so she will survive. The group — Furiosa, Capable, the Vuvalini and the surviving wives — take control of the Citadel. The Citadel's starving populace celebrates the overthrow of Immortan Joe and the return of water and greenery. Max, scarred and solitary, slips away through the crowd after sharing a final look with Furiosa.",

      "following a nuclear holocaust, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. max rockatansky (tom hardy), a survivor, is captured by the war boys, the army of the tyrannical immortan joe (hugh keays-byrne) and taken to joe's citadel. max is haunted by nightmares of a woman and a child that he failed to protect. at the citadel, max's hair is shaved, and his vital information is tattooed on his back. max tries to escape but realizes that he is being inside a cave system of a stump like mountain with sheer drops to the surface on all sides. designated a universal blood donor, max is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for a sick war boy called nux (nicholas hoult).\nmeanwhile, imperator furiosa (charlize theron), one of joe's lieutenants with one artificial arm, is sent in her armored truck to trade produce and water for petrol and ammunition with two of his allies, the bullet farmer (richard carter) and the people eater (john howard) ruler of gas town.\njoe is an old man, who has blisters all over his body. he requires a special suit to protect his body and an oxygen mask that allows him to breathe. joe rules the population with an iron fist and controls them with limited release of water for consumption at periodic intervals. the water is stored in the mountain stump, and released for a few moments on orders of joe, for the teeming masses living below. when furiosa drives off-route, joe realizes that his five wives-women selected for breeding-are missing. joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farm. nux joins the pursuit with max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. meanwhile, furiosa's rig is attacked by buzzards in hostile territory. her own escort, who is not aware that furiosa has betrayed joe, helps her fight off the buzzards, but that's when joe and his forces catch up with furiosa.\na battle ensues between the truck and joe's forces. furiosa drives into a sandstorm, evading her pursuers, except nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the truck. max escapes and restrains nux, but the car is destroyed. after the storm, max sees furiosa repairing her truck, accompanied by the wives: capable (riley keough) the most level-headed and mature of the five, cheedo the fragile (courtney eaton) the meekest and most timid, toast the knowing (zoe kravitz) the most practical and intellectual of the five and is shown to have good knowledge of guns, the dag (abbey lee) an eccentric and bold personality, and the splendid angharad (rosie huntington-whiteley) joe's most \"treasured\" breeder, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with joe's child. max steals the truck, but its kill switch disables it. max begrudgingly agrees to help furiosa's group escape joe's wrath. nux sneaks onto the rig and attempts to kill furiosa, but the women overpower him and throw him out. nux who was left behind, is picked up by joe's army. furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon to barter a deal for safe passage. however, with joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block joe. joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the rig. he sends nux to carjack the rig.\nmax and furiosa fight pursuing bikers as joe's car, with nux now on board, surmounts the blockade and eventually attacks furiosa's truck, allowing nux to board. however, as the truck escapes, angharad falls off in an attempt to protect max and is run over by joe's car, mortally wounding her and her child. furiosa explains to max that they are escaping to the \"green place\", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. capable finds nux hiding in the truck, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. that night, the truck gets stuck in mud. furiosa and max slow joe's forces with mines, but joe's ally, the bullet farmer (richard carter), continues pursuing them. nux helps max free the truck while furiosa shoots and blinds the bullet farmer. max walks into the dark to confront the bullet farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition. moved by capable's compassion, nux joins the group and helps get the rig moving again. they drive the truck overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. max suspects a trap, but furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. the naked woman summons her clan, the vuvalini, who recognize furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the green place, now inhospitable. the vulvalini include the valkyrie (megan gale), the keeper of the seeds (melissa jaffer) and others (melita jurisic, gillian jones, joy smithers, antoinette kellerman, and christina koch). the group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended citadel, which has ample water and greenery that joe keeps for himself, and trap joe and his army in the bikers' canyon. the group heads back to the citadel, but they are attacked on route by joe's forces, and furiosa is seriously wounded. joe positions his car in front of the truck to slow it, while max fights joe's giant son, rictus erectus (nathan jones). joe captures toast, but she distracts him long enough for furiosa to rip off his breathing mask, killing him. nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the truck, killing rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing max, furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini to successfully escape in joe's car, where max transfuses his blood to furiosa to help her survive her injuries. at the citadel, the impoverished citizens are overjoyed at the sight of joe's corpse. furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the war boys, but max walks away, sharing a glance with furiosa before disappearing into the crowd."

    "synopsis": [
      "it is 1936, indy (harrison ford) steals a statue from a south american temple hidden deep in the forest, dodging traps & colleagues who betray him but get killed themselves due to their lack of knowledge of ancient artifacts and the defenses designed to keep them safe. indy is able to navigate the defenses safely and get to the statue, but mistakenly activates a large boulder, when he fails to replace the correct weight of the statue on the mechanism. while escaping the boulder, indy is cornered by the hovitos, the local tribe, who are led by dr. rene belloq (paul freeman), an arrogant french archaeologist who is a longtime rival and enemy of indy's. indy has to give the statue to belloq.\nindy flees and is rescued by jock (fred sorenson), flying a seaplane. indy reckons belloq is taking it to marrakesh. marcus brody (denholm elliott) is indy's best friend and the curator of a museum back home and buys the antiques that indy rescues, for the museum. indy uses the funds to pay for his travel expenses across the world. the army officers meet indy & explain that a german radio cable from cairo to berlin says the nazis have discovered tanis, an ancient city buried in a gigantic sandstorm in 980 b.c. and the possible burial site of the ark of the covenant on which moses inscribed the ten commandments. it holds immense mystical power & can make nazi's invincible.\nthe officers explain that the cable mentioned indy's teacher professor ravenwood. indy believes that ravenwood has the staff of ra headpiece. the headpiece mounted on the staff at a certain place at a certain time, would point to the location of the ark in a special map room, with a miniature of the city on the floor. indy finds his ex-girlfriend marion (karen allen) in kathmandu, who has the headpiece that point to the location of the ark. karen is abner ravenwood's daughter. karen says that abner is dead.\nmarion is angry at indy for abandoning her but joins his quest for the ark for money (indy promises her $5000 for her help). they are followed by the nazi spy toht. toht and the nazi's attack marion to recover the headpiece. indy intervenes and a gunfight ensues which sets fire to the bar where marion works. the headpiece gets knocked around and falls in the fire. toht burns his hand when he tries to pick the red-hot headpiece. indy recovers the headpiece and toht has to retreat.\nindy & marion head to egypt to find belloq helping the nazis dig for the ark. the nazis capture marion and try to smuggle her out of cairo in a truck. indy fights the goons and shoots at the truck, which overturns and ends up in a fiery explosion, leading indy to believe that marion is dead. belloq meets a distraught indy (who thinks marion is killed) & boasts about finding the ark. belloq says that the ark is a medium to talk to god.\nindy goes to see a shaman who is reading the ra headpiece after both men have learned that belloq and his wehrmacht aide, colonel dietrich (wolf kahler), have obtained a copy of the headpiece from toht's burned hand.\nthe shaman reveals two critical facts: first, that the headpiece gives the precise height of the staff of ra, and second, that the staff the nazis used was too long (belloq got only one side of the inscriptions on the headpiece from toht's hand and hence didn't know that there were additional instructions on the back side as well) -- so their excavation is over a mile away from the ark's actual burial site, which is known as the well of souls.\nindy enters the map room himself and deduces the correct location of the ark. indy finds marion while hiding from the nazis. he leaves marion in the nazis possession (so as not to arouse suspicion) & then proceeds to dig in the actual site where the ark is buried. the dig reveals a chamber full of snakes. indy uses fire to carve a path inside the chamber.\nsallah (john rhys-davies) (indy's friend in egypt) follows and the two eventually find the gigantic chest that is the ark. meanwhile, marion seduces belloq and tries to escape nazi captivity. marion is again captured by toht. belloq then notices a team working in a portion of the city that he has not authorized and asks dietrich to gather his troops.\nthe nazi's throw marion into the chamber & set fire to it. indy follows the snakes in the chambers which leads to a german airfield. marion & indy escape by fighting off the nazis with a fighter plane.\nindy then hooks up with sallah to trace the ark which was being taken to cairo in a truck & takes it back from nazis after fighting off the armed escorts around the truck. indy takes it to us via ship, but a nazi submarine captures it back & takes it to the top of a mountain on an island. at an elaborate ceremony atop the mountain indy and marion, tied to a pole, can only watch as the ark is opened, but it contains nothing but sand, the remains of the stone tablets. no sooner is it opened, however, than its spirits suddenly appear. indy and marion, remembering an ancient code that requires people to close their eyes and not look at the now-freed spirits, withstand the mayhem that ensues as the energy of the ark surges forth and its spirits attack the now-terrified nazis, killing the entire contingent and destroying belloq in gruesome fashion. the energy mass surges high into the sky before returning to the ark and resealing it, leaving indy and marion drained but freed. weeks later indy and marcus feud with the army officers over the whereabouts of the ark, indy angry that the army has no idea what it has in the ark -- though it appears they in fact do understand what they have, as the ark is sealed in a large crate and stored anonymously in a gigantic government warehouse, never to be seen again."

He is captured by the Hovitos and forced to surrender the idol to his rival Dr. René Belloq, who is aligned with local tribes. Indiana (\"Indy\") escapes with the help of pilot Jock and returns to Marshall College, where museum curator Marcus Brody informs him that U.S. Army intelligence suspects the Nazis have located Tanis and may be searching for the Ark of the Covenant. Army officers recruit Indy because Abner Ravenwood's headpiece (the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra) will identify the Ark's burial site when mounted on the Staff of Ra in a map room.\n\nIndy tracks Marion Ravenwood to a bar in Kathmandu; she possesses the headpiece and is Abner Ravenwood's daughter. Marion distrusts Indy for abandoning her years earlier but agrees to travel to Cairo for money. Nazi agent Arnold Toht and his Gestapo operatives attack the bar. During the gunfight the headpiece is heated and scarred; Toht burns his hand trying to take it. Indy rescues Marion and they flee to Egypt.\n\nIn Cairo Belloq is working with Nazi Colonel Dietrich and archaeologists excavating near Tanis. A Nazi radio cable mentions Ravenwood, so Indy and Marion go to the excavation site where Belloq has mounted a copy of the headpiece. Marion is captured by Belloq's men; Indy fights and believes she dies when the truck carrying her overturns and explodes. Belloq taunts Indy about the Ark's ability to talk to God.\n\nIndy consults a Kathmandu expert (a Tibetan shaman) who explains that the burned headpiece gives the staff's correct height and that Belloq's team used a wrongly sized staff, excavating at the wrong site. Indy deduces the true location in the Tanis map room and returns to Cairo. He finds Marion alive in a bar where she had been held; to avoid suspicion he leaves her among the Nazis and infiltrates Belloq's site at night. Indy locates the Well of Souls and the Ark in a snake-filled chamber; he fends off snakes with fire. Sallah, Indy's Egyptian friend, helps dig up the Ark.\n\nBelloq and the Nazis seize the Ark, imprison Marion and Indy, and transport the Ark to Cairo. Indy and Marion escape, steal a Luftwaffe fighter and flee. Indy and Sallah steal the Ark from a Nazi convoy and load it onto a U.S. Army transport ship bound for New York. A Nazi U-boat intercepts the convoy, boards the ship, and recovers the Ark, taking it to an island mountaintop where a Nazi ceremony is arranged. Belloq and Nazi leaders open the Ark in a ritual while Indy and Marion are tied to poles and forced to watch.\n\nWhen Belloq opens the Ark, invisible supernatural forces pour out; whoever looks upon them is destroyed. Marion and Indy keep their eyes closed; the Nazis and Belloq look and are killed in horrific fashion as the Ark's power consumes and melts faces, frays flesh, and annihilates the Nazi contingent. The Ark's power returns to the chest and it reseals. Weeks later, Indy and Marcus confront U.S. Army officers about the Ark's disappearance; the Army has taken possession and stores the Ark in a massive, anonymous government warehouse, where it is catalogued and shelved among countless crates.",

      "it is 1936, indy (harrison ford) steals a statue from a south american temple hidden deep in the forest, dodging traps & colleagues who betray him but get killed themselves due to their lack of knowledge of ancient artifacts and the defenses designed to keep them safe. indy is able to navigate the defenses safely and get to the statue, but mistakenly activates a large boulder, when he fails to replace the correct weight of the statue on the mechanism. while escaping the boulder, indy is cornered by the hovitos, the local tribe, who are led by dr. rene belloq (paul freeman), an arrogant french archaeologist who is a longtime rival and enemy of indy's. indy has to give the statue to belloq.\nindy flees and is rescued by jock (fred sorenson), flying a seaplane. indy reckons belloq is taking it to marrakesh. marcus brody (denholm elliott) is indy's best friend and the curator of a museum back home and buys the antiques that indy rescues, for the museum. indy uses the funds to pay for his travel expenses across the world. the army officers meet indy & explain that a german radio cable from cairo to berlin says the nazis have discovered tanis, an ancient city buried in a gigantic sandstorm in 980 b.c. and the possible burial site of the ark of the covenant on which moses inscribed the ten commandments. it holds immense mystical power & can make nazi's invincible.\nthe officers explain that the cable mentioned indy's teacher professor ravenwood. indy believes that ravenwood has the staff of ra headpiece. the headpiece mounted on the staff at a certain place at a certain time, would point to the location of the ark in a special map room, with a miniature of the city on the floor. indy finds his ex-girlfriend marion (karen allen) in kathmandu, who has the headpiece that point to the location of the ark. karen is abner ravenwood's daughter. karen says that abner is dead.\nmarion is angry at indy for abandoning her but joins his quest for the ark for money (indy promises her $5000 for her help). they are followed by the nazi spy toht. toht and the nazi's attack marion to recover the headpiece. indy intervenes and a gunfight ensues which sets fire to the bar where marion works. the headpiece gets knocked around and falls in the fire. toht burns his hand when he tries to pick the red-hot headpiece. indy recovers the headpiece and toht has to retreat.\nindy & marion head to egypt to find belloq helping the nazis dig for the ark. the nazis capture marion and try to smuggle her out of cairo in a truck. indy fights the goons and shoots at the truck, which overturns and ends up in a fiery explosion, leading indy to believe that marion is dead. belloq meets a distraught indy (who thinks marion is killed) & boasts about finding the ark. belloq says that the ark is a medium to talk to god.\nindy goes to see a shaman who is reading the ra headpiece after both men have learned that belloq and his wehrmacht aide, colonel dietrich (wolf kahler), have obtained a copy of the headpiece from toht's burned hand.\nthe shaman reveals two critical facts: first, that the headpiece gives the precise height of the staff of ra, and second, that the staff the nazis used was too long (belloq got only one side of the inscriptions on the headpiece from toht's hand and hence didn't know that there were additional instructions on the back side as well) -- so their excavation is over a mile away from the ark's actual burial site, which is known as the well of souls.\nindy enters the map room himself and deduces the correct location of the ark. indy finds marion while hiding from the nazis. he leaves marion in the nazis possession (so as not to arouse suspicion) & then proceeds to dig in the actual site where the ark is buried. the dig reveals a chamber full of snakes. indy uses fire to carve a path inside the chamber.\nsallah (john rhys-davies) (indy's friend in egypt) follows and the two eventually find the gigantic chest that is the ark. meanwhile, marion seduces belloq and tries to escape nazi captivity. marion is again captured by toht. belloq then notices a team working in a portion of the city that he has not authorized and asks dietrich to gather his troops.\nthe nazi's throw marion into the chamber & set fire to it. indy follows the snakes in the chambers which leads to a german airfield. marion & indy escape by fighting off the nazis with a fighter plane.\nindy then hooks up with sallah to trace the ark which was being taken to cairo in a truck & takes it back from nazis after fighting off the armed escorts around the truck. indy takes it to us via ship, but a nazi submarine captures it back & takes it to the top of a mountain on an island. at an elaborate ceremony atop the mountain indy and marion, tied to a pole, can only watch as the ark is opened, but it contains nothing but sand, the remains of the stone tablets. no sooner is it opened, however, than its spirits suddenly appear. indy and marion, remembering an ancient code that requires people to close their eyes and not look at the now-freed spirits, withstand the mayhem that ensues as the energy of the ark surges forth and its spirits attack the now-terrified nazis, killing the entire contingent and destroying belloq in gruesome fashion. the energy mass surges high into the sky before returning to the ark and resealing it, leaving indy and marion drained but freed. weeks later indy and marcus feud with the army officers over the whereabouts of the ark, indy angry that the army has no idea what it has in the ark -- though it appears they in fact do understand what they have, as the ark is sealed in a large crate and stored anonymously in a gigantic government warehouse, never to be seen again."

      "a gang of 6 criminals rob a gotham city mob bank and start murdering each other for a higher share. they suggest that a sixth member of the gang - nicknamed 'the joker' - who did the planning, but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. at the end, only the joker (heath ledger) remains, and he escapes with the money. joker is a psychopathic illegal mastermind portraying himself as an \"agent of chaos\", who rises from the criminal underworld by thrusting gotham into anarchy. gordon arrives at the bank the joker held up earlier with ramirez who shows him the joker's picture from a security camera. batman arrives to inspect the scene, noting that they have irradiated the drug money to make it easier to trace. when gordon asks him if the joker is a threat, batman informs him that he cannot worry about one man when there is an entire mob to bring down. batman (christian bale) is the alter ego of a billionaire socialite bruce wayne who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging at age 8, travels the world for seven years before returning home to operate as a bat-masked vigilante hailed as gotham city's \"dark knight\", using fear against the city's criminal underworld at night.\ndistrict attorney harvey dent (aaron eckhart) is hailed as gotham's \"white knight\", who is running a campaign against the criminal underworld.\nlieutenant jim gordon (gary oldman) of the police department works under the current police commissioner. gotham is then seen at night with criminals afraid to commit crimes under the watchful sign of the bat-signal projected onto the clouds. lt. james gordon mans the bat-signal, waiting for batman with det. anna ramirez (monique gabriela curnen), who asks if he's coming. gordon explains that it is okay if he is not, hoping that he is busy elsewhere. he asks about ramirez' mother, who's in the hospital. meanwhile, in a parking garage, the scarecrow (cillian murphy), still at-large after escaping arkham asylum, is negotiating with the russian mob members, led by the chechen, over the sale of some of his fear-inducing drugs. the sale is interrupted when some of gotham's citizens dressed as batmen wanna-be's begin shooting at the men. as he gases one of the fake batmen with his mind-altering drugs from his cuff, the scarecrow notes that they are not the real batman, because batman would never use a gun. suddenly the batmobile/tumbler crashes through a barricade. the batmobile, pre-programmed to \"loiter\" and then \"intimidate\", fires rockets into a nearby office, sending the remaining mobsters running. the real batman arrives and bends the rifle barrel of one of the wanna-be batmen before knocking him out. the chechen sends his rottweilers to attack the batmen, and as batman saves them he takes the dogs out after being badly bitten in the arm. the scarecrow attempts to flee in a white van but batman jumps onto the van and begins cutting into the side with his device called the mangler. scarecrow swerves into a support which sends batman to the ground. as scarecrow gets away down a spiraling passageway, batman leaps onto the roof of his van, smashing it to a halt. he leaves the fake batmen and the scarecrow along with some of the mobsters tied up together for the police to eventually round up. when one of the impostors says he's trying to help, batman harshly tells him he doesn't need any help. the next day, as bruce wayne stitches himself up from the dog bite. alfred (michael caine) notices bruce keeping a close watch on newly appointed district attorney harvey dent via some computer screens, as bruce is trying to decide whether or not dent can be trusted. alfred wonders if he is really spying on the relationship that rachel dawes has developed with harvey dent. harvey dent arrives in court to join rachel dawes in prosecuting mobster salvatore maroni (eric roberts), the alleged new leader of the falcone crime family. one of maroni's men takes the fall in court and attempts to shoot dent from the witness stand. the gun doesn't go off and dent punches the man before he is hauled off to jail. maroni is eventually set free, to the dismay of dent. dent meets lt. gordon, and after a short exchange of words, they both express their distrust for those that are working in each other's offices. harvey interrogates gordon over his involvement with the batman and harvey tells him he wants to meet him. gordon requests search warrants for five banks that are believed to be holding the remainder of the mobs money. dent agrees to back gordon's search warrants, forming a tenuous trust with the honest gordon. lucius fox holds a board meeting at wayne enterprises, negotiating an joint venture with lau, the head of lau security investments, based in hong kong. after the meeting with lau, wayne expresses his reservations with lucius fox about lau's business operation, apparently illegal based on their profits. after agreeing to cancel the deal, wayne asks fox for a new suit. he explains that he needs to be lighter, and faster, in case he runs into any more guard dogs and that he wants to be able to turn his head. that night, harvey dines out with rachel. harvey tells rachel he had to make a reservation weeks earlier, and even then needed to exercised his influence to get a table at the very fashionable restaurant. bruce and his date, the prima ballerina for the russian ballet, encounter rachel and harvey. bruce has them pull a table together so they can dine together, informing harvey that he owns the restaurant. at first, bruce seems jealous and threatened by harvey, based on the fact that he is dating rachel, but harvey explains how he supports the work of batman and appreciates his help. bruce changes his tune and informs harvey that he intends to throw a massive fund-raiser for him. bruce wayne is impressed with dent's idealism as dent has gone after every money launderer in the city and he knows that batman and gordon are going after the mob's money supply, and wants in.\nbruce offers to support his career; he believes that, with dent as gotham's protector, he can give up being batman and lead a normal life with rachel dawes (maggie gyllenhaal).\nrachel is gotham city's assistant district attorney and bruce's childhood friend, who is one of the few people who knows batman's true identity. although rachel and dent are currently dating. mob bosses sal maroni (eric roberts) (an italian mafia boss who takes over carmine falcone's mob), gambol (michael jai white) (an african american mafia boss in charge of illegal gambling and extortion for the mob), and the chechen (ritchie coster) (in charge of drug-trafficking for the mob) hold a video-conference with their corrupt accountant, lau (ng chin) (a corrupt chinese lsi holdings accountant triad boss), who has hidden their funds for safekeeping and fled to hong kong. lau says that gordon and dent have raided all the mob banks, but he moved the money before they could get to it. the money will be in hk where us authorities can't touch it. the meeting is interrupted by the joker, who warns them that batman is unhindered by the law (and alleges that lau would squeal to the police) and offers to kill batman in exchange for half of their money. the mob laughs, and as one of the mobsters, gambol, rises from his seat and threatens the joker, the joker opens his coat, exposing grenades. gambol tells the joker that he's putting a price out on his head. the joker tells the mob that when they plan to take things a little more seriously, give him a call, and presents them with 'his card', a joker playing card. and with that, he exits. but not before warning that batman will come for lau. gambol is playing pool with some of his associates until one of them informs him that a group of hoodlums have killed the joker, and has the body. the body is brought in covered in a bag, and as gambol is about to pay, the joker rises up and holds a knife to his face while his men hold guns to his associates' heads. the joker tells a story about how he got his scars from his father, and then kills gambol. batman has a meeting with gordon and dent and promises to bring back lau to us. batman finds lau in hong kong. bruce wayne's company was already investigating lau's company for a possible takeover bid, but in reality, bruce was just getting a good look at his books.\nfox shows wayne his new suit, and wayne begins planning an impromptu trip to hong kong. fox will accompany him, making it look like the only reason for his visit was to cancel the negotiations with lau's company. meanwhile, fox arrives in hong kong to meet with lau. he checks in his mobile phone at the front desk at lau's building, as there are no cell phones allowed on the premises. fox meets with lau, and informs him of wayne enterprises' plans to cancel negotiations with his company. however, he secretly keeps one cell phone in his pocket, which has been adapted to produce a sonar map of the surrounding area. upon leaving the building, he does not pick up the phone he dropped off, and he produces the map of the building to bruce wayne. that night, the phone that fox left at the front desk emits a high frequency that shuts down all power in the building. batman crashes in through a window in lau's office, and after a vicious fight with some of his guards, grabs lau and escapes by sending a balloon attached to a cable to a plane he has chartered flying over lau's building. batman brings lau back to gotham to testify by capturing lau in his hk office and using the cia's sky-hook project to bring him out, allowing dent to apprehend the entire mob. back in gotham, lau is interrogated by rachel with dent and gordon looking on. rachel presses him to give them the money lau has taken, but lau will not give in. after she threatens to have him moved to the county lock-up, lau tells her that he can give them the names of the mobsters and their pooled investments. dent then realizes that they will have the leverage they need in a rico case of conspiracy to link all of the mob members together. gordon decides to keep lau in his holding cell at the major case unit building and lau agrees to cooperate with the police and give the names of the mob members. gordon appears at maroni's restaurant as the police rush in to arrest all of the mob members in attendance. as all of the mob members that lau informed the police are rounded up for arraignment, judge janet surrillo finds a joker card in the middle of the stack of conviction papers. dent gives a televised impromptu interview denying batman's involvement while expressing gratitude for the police work in bringing the mob members to justice. the joker threatens a string of murders unless batman reveals his identity and starts by killing police commissioner gillian b. loeb (colin mcfarlane) and judge surillo, who is presiding over the mob trial. the judge's car blows up when the police arrive to take her into protective custody and commissioner loeb dies of severe poisoning from his liquor bottle before gordon can stop him from drinking. batman is able to save dent when joker attacks the fundraiser that bruce wayne had thrown for dent. the joker also targets mayor anthony garcia (nestor carbonell), but gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. joker infiltrates the police guard giving the 21-gun salute for the commissioner and aims his gun at the mayor. gordon spots this and comes in front of the bullet. dent learns that rachel is the next target. gordon's family is visited at home, to inform them of the death of gordon at the funeral ceremony. gordon's wife, barbara, shouts out at the empty sky to batman that he has brought this craziness upon gotham. gordon's young son catches a brief glimpse of batman mournfully watching the scene. bruce decides to reveal his identity. bruce arrives back in his penthouse to find rachel waiting. she tells him that turning himself in will not stop the joker's murderous rampage, but bruce says he has enough blood on his hands already. he reminds her that she promised him that they would be together if and when he hung up the mantle of batman. she tells bruce not to make her his only hope for a normal life and they share a kiss. she tells bruce that if he turns himself in as batman that the city will never let them be together. back at wayne's secret base of operations for batman, he and alfred begin destroying everything that might tie lucius fox or rachel to batman. alfred tries to talk bruce out of it, asking him to endure these trying times and allow batman to make the right choice that nobody else can for the good of the city. before bruce can reveal himself as batman dent announces that he is batman. rachel, watching the news conference at bruce wayne's penthouse, confronts alfred over bruce's seeming cowardice in allowing harvey to take the fall when he claims to be batman. alfred explains to rachel that batman is instead allowing himself to be something else besides a hero, mainly a figure outside of the system that the people can both turn to or blame in times of need, that batman can 'take it\". rachel gives alfred a letter for bruce and tells him to give it to bruce when the time is right. when alfred asks what it is, she tells him it is open and hugs him before departing to see harvey as he is being transported to the county lock-up. dent is taken into protective custody, but the joker appears and attacks the convoy. while transporting harvey, the joker and some goons start taking out the police cars in a large semi-truck. he pulls out an rpg and begins firing at the armored truck carrying dent. the tumbler arrives and attempts to stop the joker and is hit by one of the joker's rpgs. his car takes 'catastrophic' damage, and he's forced to eject. however, the ejection in this car is a bike, the batpod, that deploys out the front of the car. batman chases down the joker on his batpod, and after firing some cables at the truck and weaving them through some light poles and buildings, flips the truck completely over. the joker emerges with a smith & wesson m76 submachine gun and shoots at batman, who speeds towards him on his batpod, all the while screaming at batman to hit him. batman honors his own non-lethal code and swerves around the joker then crashes into the flipped truck, falling to the ground. as the joker jumps on him with a knife, one of the swat officers holds a shotgun to the back of his head, and upon removing his helmet and mask, shows that it was lt. gordon, who faked his death to protect his family. the joker is hauled away to the mcu. harvey gets out of the truck and into a cruiser, stating he is off to see a worried girlfriend.\nat gordon's major crimes unit building, gordon is promoted to commissioner by the mayor. rachel and dent are escorted away by detectives on maroni's payroll. gordon later learns that they never arrived home. batman interrogates the joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. batman races to save rachel, while gordon attempts to rescue dent. batman arrives at the site but realizes that the joker sent him to dent's location instead. both buildings explode, killing rachel and disfiguring half of dent's face. the joker escapes the lockup with lau (after he triggers a bomb that he had smuggled inside the stomach of another prisoner), whom he later kills along with the chechen (by setting them on fire along with the mob's money). lucius fox is the recently promoted ceo of wayne enterprises who, now fully aware of his employer's double life, serves more directly as bruce's armorer for the batsuit in addition to his corporate duties.\ncoleman reese, an accountant at wayne enterprises, claims to know about certain problems with wayne's funding in research and development, claiming that wayne has some sort of government project with cell phones for the army underway. he also uncovers fox's designs for the batmobile/tumbler. he wanted fox to pay him $10mm per year for the rest of his life to keep quiet. not wanting reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills reese within the hour. gordon orders the evacuation of all hospitals in gotham and goes to secure reese. the joker breaks into dent's hospital in the confusion and gives dent a gun and convinces him to seek revenge for rachel's death. he convinces dent to become an agent of chaos just like himself, then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. dent goes on a killing spree, as the vigilante two-face, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin-one side having been scorched in the explosion. he kills sal and the 2 corrupt cops whom he held responsible for rachael's death after announcing gotham will be subject to his rule come nightfall, the joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives, one containing ordinary folks and the other containing prisoners. he threatens to blow them both up by midnight but will let one ferry live if its passengers (who have been supplied the detonator to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. batman finds the joker by exploiting the sonar capabilities of all phones in the city, with the reluctant help of lucius fox (morgan freeman). fox says that he will resign from his post after this assignment. both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while batman apprehends the joker after a brief fight. joker was hiding in a building and had disguised all the hostages as his henchmen, with guns taped to their hands and wearing masks. batman saves all hostages from gordon's swat teams before apprehending joker. before the swat arrive to take the joker into custody, he gloats that gotham's citizens will lose hope once dent's rampage becomes public knowledge. gordon and batman arrive at the building where rachel perished, and encounter two-face, who has kept gordon's family as hostages. two-face shoots batman, and threatens to kill gordon's son, claiming that gordon's negligence is responsible for rachel's death. before he flips his coin for the boy, batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles two-face off the building to his death. batman persuades gordon to hold him responsible for the killing spree and preserve dent's heroic image. dent is hailed as a hero and the police launch a manhunt for batman. gordon destroys the bat-signal, fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and alfred pennyworth (michael caine) burns a letter from rachel saying she planned to marry dent (she had given this letter to alfred before her death)."

      "plot_summary": "Gotham City: after Batman has driven down petty crime, District Attorney Harvey Dent prosecutes mob boss Salvatore Maroni while Lieutenant James Gordon and Batman (Bruce Wayne) raid mob bank accounts. The Chinese accountant Lau, who laundered the mob’s money, flees to Hong Kong. At a mob meeting Lau refuses to cooperate; the Joker (unnamed criminal mastermind) appears, offers to kill Batman, then stages a brutal takeover of Gambol’s payroll and proves he can slaughter mobsters.\nBatman (using Lucius Fox’s sonar-enabled upgrades and a lighter, more agile suit) locates Lau in Hong Kong and extracts him to Gotham via a sky-hook. Lau agrees to inform on the mob, enabling mass arrests. Shortly afterward the Joker begins murdering key officials (Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and Judge Surillo) and attacks a fundraiser for Harvey Dent; Batman saves Dent and Mayor Anthony Garcia; Gordon appears to be killed protecting the mayor but later reveals he staged his death.\nWith Gordon promoted to acting commissioner, Dent publicly claims to be Batman to protect Bruce Wayne. While Dent is transported in custody the Joker attacks the convoy using an armored truck; Batman pursues on the Batpod and stops the Joker, who is captured and jailed. The Joker reveals he has rigged two separate locations with hostages tied to explosives (one location contains Rachel Dawes, Dent’s girlfriend, the other Harvey Dent). Batman and Gordon race to save them; the Joker misdirects Batman to Dent’s location and Gordon to Rachel’s. Both sites explode: Rachel dies, half of Dent’s face is burned; Lau is freed from the MCU by the Joker and later burned to death along with the Chechen and the mob money.\nIn the wreckage the Joker manipulates Dent’s grief into vengeance — arming him, giving him a gun, and convincing him to embrace chaos. Dent becomes the killer Two-Face, executing mob boss Sal Maroni and two corrupt cops he blames for Rachel’s death by flipping a scarred coin. The Joker rigs two ferries (one with civilians, one with prisoners) with explosives, forcing their passengers to choose whether to blow up the other boat; neither group kills the other. Lucius Fox helps Batman triangulate the Joker’s hideout using city-wide sonar from cell phones. Batman captures the Joker before midnight.\nThe Joker gloats that Dent’s crimes will destroy Gotham’s faith. Two-Face kidnaps Gordon’s family and takes Gordon to the rooftop where Rachel died. He forces a choice and prepares to flip his coin for Gordon’s young son. Batman — wearing body armor — tackles Two-Face off the roof; Two-Face falls to his death. To preserve Gotham’s hope in Harvey Dent as the city’s “White Knight,” Batman persuades Gordon to conceal Dent’s crimes and instead blame Batman for Two-Face’s killings. Gordon agrees, destroys the Bat-Signal, and announces a manhunt for Batman. Alfred burns Rachel’s letter, Lucius destroys the sonar evidence, and Bruce Wayne goes into exile as Gotham’s outcast so Dent’s heroic image can endure.",

but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. at the end, only the joker (heath ledger) remains, and he escapes with the money. joker is a psychopathic illegal mastermind portraying himself as an \"agent of chaos\", who rises from the criminal underworld by thrusting gotham into anarchy. gordon arrives at the bank the joker held up earlier with ramirez who shows him the joker's picture from a security camera. batman arrives to inspect the scene, noting that they have irradiated the drug money to make it easier to trace. when gordon asks him if the joker is a threat, batman informs him that he cannot worry about one man when there is an entire mob to bring down. batman (christian bale) is the alter ego of a billionaire socialite bruce wayne who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging at age 8, travels the world for seven years before returning home to operate as a bat-masked vigilante hailed as gotham city's \"dark knight\", using fear against the city's criminal

oldman) of the police department works under the current police commissioner. gotham is then seen at night with criminals afraid to commit crimes under the watchful sign of the bat-signal projected onto the clouds. lt. james gordon mans the bat-signal, waiting for batman with det. anna ramirez (monique gabriela curnen), who asks if he's coming. gordon explains that it is okay if he is not, hoping that he is busy elsewhere. he asks about ramirez' mother, who's in the hospital. meanwhile, in a parking garage, the scarecrow (cillian murphy), still at-large after escaping arkham asylum, is negotiating with the russian mob members, led by the chechen, over the sale of some of his fear-inducing drugs. the sale is interrupted when some of gotham's citizens dressed as batmen wanna-be's begin shooting at the men. as he gases one of the fake batmen with his mind-altering drugs from his cuff, the scarecrow notes that they are not the real batman, because batman would never use a gun. suddenly the batmobile/tumbler crashes through a barricade. the batmobile, pre-programmed to \"loiter\" and then \"intimidate\", fires rockets into a nearby office, sending the remaining mobsters running. the real batman arrives and bends the rifle barrel of one of the wanna-be batmen before knocking him out. the chechen sends his rottweilers to attack the batmen, and as batman saves them he takes the dogs out after being badly bitten in the arm. the scarecrow attempts to flee in a white van but batman jumps onto the van and begins cutting into the side with his device called the mangler. scarecrow swerves into a support which sends batman to the ground. as scarecrow gets away down a spiraling passageway, batman leaps onto the roof of his van, smashing it to a halt. he leaves the fake batmen and the scarecrow along with some of the mobsters tied up together for the police to eventually round up. when one of the impostors says he's trying to help, batman harshly tells him he doesn't need any help. the next day, as bruce wayne stitches himself up from the dog bite. alfred (michael caine) notices bruce keeping a close watch on newly appointed district attorney harvey dent via some computer screens, as bruce is trying to decide whether or not dent can be trusted. alfred wonders if he is really spying on the relationship that rachel dawes has developed with harvey dent. harvey dent arrives in court to join rachel dawes in prosecuting mobster salvatore maroni (eric roberts), the alleged new leader of the falcone crime family. one of maroni's men takes the fall in court and attempts to shoot dent from the witness stand. the gun doesn't go off and dent punches the man before he is hauled off to jail. maroni is eventually set free, to the dismay of dent. dent meets lt. gordon, and after a short exchange of words, they both express their distrust for those that are working in each other's offices. harvey interrogates gordon over his involvement with the batman and harvey tells him he wants to meet him. gordon requests search warrants for five banks that are believed to be holding the remainder of the mobs money. dent agrees to back gordon's search warrants, forming a tenuous trust with the honest gordon. lucius fox holds a board meeting at wayne enterprises, negotiating an joint venture with lau, the head of lau security investments, based in hong kong. after the meeting with lau, wayne expresses his reservations with lucius fox about lau's business operation, apparently illegal based on their profits. after agreeing to cancel the deal, wayne asks fox for a new suit. he explains that he needs to be lighter, and faster, in case he runs into any more guard dogs and that he wants to be able to turn his head. that night, harvey dines out with rachel. harvey tells rachel he had to make a reservation weeks earlier, and even then needed to exercised his influence to get a table at the very fashionable restaurant. bruce and his date, the prima ballerina for the russian ballet, encounter rachel and harvey. bruce has them pull a table together so they can dine together, informing harvey that he owns the restaurant. at first, bruce seems jealous and threatened by harvey, based on the fact that he is dating rachel, but harvey explains how he supports the work of batman and appreciates his help. bruce changes his tune and informs harvey that he intends to throw a massive fund-raiser for him. bruce wayne is impressed with dent's idealism as dent has gone after every money launderer in the city and he knows that batman and gordon are going after the mob's money supply, and wants in.\nbruce offers to support his career; he believes that, with dent as gotham's protector, he can give up being batman and lead a normal life with rachel dawes (maggie gyllenhaal).\nrachel is gotham city's assistant district attorney and bruce's childhood friend, who is one of the few people who knows batman's true identity. although rachel and dent are currently dating. mob bosses sal maroni (eric roberts) (an italian mafia boss who takes over carmine falcone's mob), gambol (michael jai white) (an african american mafia boss in charge of illegal gambling and extortion for the mob), and the chechen (ritchie coster) (in charge of drug-trafficking for the mob) hold a video-conference with their corrupt accountant, lau (ng chin) (a corrupt chinese lsi holdings accountant triad boss), who has hidden their funds for safekeeping and fled to hong kong. lau says that gordon and dent have raided all the mob banks, but he moved the money before they could get to it. the money will be in hk where us authorities can't touch it. the meeting is interrupted by the joker, who warns them that batman is unhindered by the law (and alleges that lau would squeal to the police) and offers to kill batman in exchange for half of their money. the mob laughs, and as one of the mobsters, gambol, rises from his seat and threatens the joker, the joker opens his coat, exposing grenades. gambol tells the joker that he's putting a price out on his head. the joker tells the mob that when they plan to take things a little more seriously, give him a call, and presents them with 'his card', a joker playing card. and with that, he exits. but not before warning that batman will come for lau. gambol is playing pool with some of his associates until one of them informs him that a group of hoodlums have killed the joker, and has the body. the body is brought in covered in a bag, and as gambol is about to pay, the joker rises up and holds a knife to his face while his men hold guns to his associates' heads. the joker tells a story about how he got his scars from his father, and then kills gambol. batman has a meeting with gordon and dent and promises to bring back lau to us. batman finds lau in hong kong. bruce wayne's company was already investigating lau's company for a possible takeover bid, but in reality, bruce was just getting a good look at his books.\nfox shows wayne his new suit, and wayne begins planning an impromptu trip to hong kong. fox will accompany him, making it look like the only reason for his visit was to cancel the negotiations with lau's company. meanwhile, fox arrives in hong kong to meet with lau. he checks in his mobile phone at the front desk at lau's building, as there are no cell phones allowed on the premises. fox meets with lau, and informs him of wayne enterprises' plans to cancel negotiations with his company. however, he secretly keeps one cell phone in his pocket, which has been adapted to produce a sonar map of the surrounding area. upon leaving the building, he does not pick up the phone he dropped off, and he produces the map of the building to bruce wayne. that night, the phone that fox left at the front desk emits a high frequency that shuts down all power in the building. batman crashes in through a window in lau's office, and after a vicious fight with some of his guards, grabs lau and escapes by sending a balloon attached to a cable to a plane he has chartered flying over lau's building. batman brings lau back to gotham to testify by capturing lau in his hk office and using the cia's sky-hook project to bring him out, allowing dent to apprehend the entire mob. back in gotham, lau is interrogated by rachel with dent and gordon looking on. rachel presses him to give them the money lau has taken, but lau will not give in. after she threatens to have him moved to the county lock-up, lau tells her that he can give them the names of the mobsters and their pooled investments. dent then realizes that they will have the leverage they need in a rico case of conspiracy to link all of the mob members together. gordon decides to keep lau in his holding cell at the major case unit building and lau agrees to cooperate with the police and give the names of the mob members. gordon appears at maroni's restaurant as the police rush in to arrest all of the mob members in attendance. as all of the mob members that lau informed the police are rounded up for arraignment, judge janet surrillo finds a joker card in the middle of the stack of conviction papers. dent gives a televised impromptu interview denying batman's involvement while expressing gratitude for the police work in bringing the mob members to justice. the joker threatens a string of murders unless batman reveals his identity and starts by killing police commissioner gillian b. loeb (colin mcfarlane) and judge surillo, who is presiding over the mob trial. the judge's car blows up when the police arrive to take her into protective custody and commissioner loeb dies of severe poisoning from his liquor bottle before gordon can stop him from drinking. batman is able to save dent when joker attacks the fundraiser that bruce wayne had thrown for dent. the joker also targets mayor anthony garcia (nestor carbonell), but gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. joker infiltrates the police guard giving the 21-gun salute for the commissioner and aims his gun at the mayor. gordon spots this and comes in front of the bullet. dent learns that rachel is the next target. gordon's family is visited at home, to inform them of the death of gordon at the funeral ceremony. gordon's wife, barbara, shouts out at the empty sky to batman that he has brought this craziness upon gotham. gordon's young son catches a brief glimpse of batman mournfully watching the scene. bruce decides to reveal his identity. bruce arrives back in his penthouse to find rachel waiting. she tells him that turning himself in will not stop the joker's murderous rampage, but bruce says he has enough blood on his hands already. he reminds her that she promised him that they would be together if and when he hung up the mantle of batman. she tells bruce not to make her his only hope for a normal life and they share a kiss. she tells bruce that if he turns himself in as batman that the city will never let them be together. back at wayne's secret base of operations for batman, he and alfred begin destroying everything that might tie lucius fox or rachel to batman. alfred tries to talk bruce out of it, asking him to endure these trying times and allow batman to make the right choice that nobody else can for the good of the city. before bruce can reveal himself as batman dent announces that he is batman. rachel, watching the news conference at bruce wayne's penthouse, confronts alfred over bruce's seeming cowardice in allowing harvey to take the fall when he claims to be batman. alfred explains to rachel that batman is instead allowing himself to be something else besides a hero, mainly a figure outside of the system that the people can both turn to or blame in times of need, that batman can 'take it\". rachel gives alfred a letter for bruce and tells him to give it to bruce when the time is right. when alfred asks what it is, she tells him it is open and hugs him before departing to see harvey as he is being transported to the county lock-up. dent is taken into protective custody, but the joker appears and attacks the convoy. while transporting harvey, the joker and some goons start taking out the police cars in a large semi-truck. he pulls out an rpg and begins firing at the armored truck carrying dent. the tumbler arrives and attempts to stop the joker and is hit by one of the joker's rpgs. his car takes 'catastrophic' damage, and he's forced to eject. however, the ejection in this car is a bike, the batpod, that deploys out the front of the car. batman chases down the joker on his batpod, and after firing some cables at the truck and weaving them through some light poles and buildings, flips the truck completely over. the joker emerges with a smith & wesson m76 submachine gun and shoots at batman, who speeds towards him on his batpod, all the while screaming at batman to hit him. batman honors his own non-lethal code and swerves around the joker then crashes into the flipped truck, falling to the ground. as the joker jumps on him with a knife, one of the swat officers holds a shotgun to the back of his head, and upon removing his helmet and mask, shows that it was lt. gordon, who faked his death to protect his family. the joker is hauled away to the mcu. harvey gets out of the truck and into a cruiser, stating he is off to see a worried girlfriend.\nat gordon's major crimes unit building, gordon is promoted to commissioner by the mayor. rachel and dent are escorted away by detectives on maroni's payroll. gordon later learns that they never arrived home. batman interrogates the joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. batman races to save rachel, while gordon attempts to rescue dent. batman arrives at the site but realizes that the joker sent him to dent's location instead. both buildings explode, killing rachel and disfiguring half of dent's face. the joker escapes the lockup with lau (after he triggers a bomb that he had smuggled inside the stomach of another prisoner), whom he later kills along with the chechen (by setting them on fire along with the mob's money). lucius fox is the recently promoted ceo of wayne enterprises who, now fully aware of his employer's double life, serves more directly as bruce's armorer for the batsuit in addition to his corporate duties.\ncoleman reese, an accountant at wayne enterprises, claims to know about certain problems with wayne's funding in research and development, claiming that wayne has some sort of government project with cell phones for the army underway. he also uncovers fox's designs for the batmobile/tumbler. he wanted fox to pay him $10mm per year for the rest of his life to keep quiet. not wanting reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills reese within the hour. gordon orders the evacuation of all hospitals in gotham and goes to secure reese. the joker breaks into dent's hospital in the confusion and gives dent a gun and convinces him to seek revenge for rachel's death. he convinces dent to become an agent of chaos just like himself, then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. dent goes on a killing spree, as the vigilante two-face, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin-one side having been scorched in the explosion. he kills sal and the 2 corrupt cops whom he held responsible for rachael's death after announcing gotham will be subject to his rule come nightfall, the joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives, one containing ordinary folks and the other containing prisoners. he threatens to blow them both up by midnight but will let one ferry live if its passengers (who have been supplied the detonator to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. batman finds the joker by exploiting the sonar capabilities of all phones in the city, with the reluctant help of lucius fox (morgan freeman). fox says that he will resign from his post after this assignment. both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while batman apprehends the joker after a brief fight. joker was hiding in a building and had disguised all the hostages as his henchmen, with guns taped to their hands and wearing masks. batman saves all hostages from gordon's swat teams before apprehending joker. before the swat arrive to take the joker into custody, he gloats that gotham's citizens will lose hope once dent's rampage becomes public knowledge. gordon and batman arrive at the building where rachel perished, and encounter two-face, who has kept gordon's family as hostages. two-face shoots batman, and threatens to kill gordon's son, claiming that gordon's negligence is responsible for rachel's death. before he flips his coin for the boy, batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles two-face off the building to his death. batman persuades gordon to hold him responsible for the killing spree and preserve dent's heroic image. dent is hailed as a hero and the police launch a manhunt for batman. gordon destroys the bat-signal, fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and alfred pennyworth (michael caine) burns a letter from rachel saying she planned to marry dent (she had given this letter to alfred before her death)."

      "in new york city, john wick is grieving the death of his wife helen, who had arranged for him to receive a beagle puppy to help cope with his loss. a few days later, a group of russian gangsters led by iosef tarasov accost john at a gas station and fail to intimidate him into selling them his 1969 boss 429 mustang.[ii] that night, they break into john's home, assault him, kill the puppy, and steal the car. iosef takes the mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, aurelio, recognizes it and refuses service. aurelio informs john that iosef is the son of viggo tarasov, the boss of new york city's russian mafia. upon learning of his son's actions, viggo berates iosef for incurring john's wrath. he reveals john was once a hit-man in his employ, and was renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \"baba yaga\", a ruthless, relentless \"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will\". after john fell in love with helen, a civilian, viggo gave him a seemingly impossible task to earn his freedom; he succeeded. john recovers a concealed stash from his former career that includes weapons and gold coins. he rejects viggo's attempt to make amends and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. viggo puts a $2 million bounty on john and enlists john's former mentor, marcus, to kill him. john lodges at the continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal business is forbidden. winston, the hotel's owner and john's old friend, informs him that iosef is at a nightclub called red circle. john infiltrates red circle and confronts iosef, but he is attacked by viggo's henchman kirill and forced to retreat to the continental for medical attention. as john rests, a hit-woman, ms. perkins, sneaks into his room. marcus sees perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert john, who wakes up and subdues her. perkins reveals viggo has doubled the bounty for her to kill john in the hotel and has concealed a high-value stash in a church. john hires another hit-man, harry, to secure perkins but she kills harry and escapes. at the church, john destroys viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. when viggo arrives to assess the damage, john assaults him and his men but is hit by kirill's car and captured. john tells viggo he will not stop until iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for helen. marcus again intervenes to save john, who kills kirill and threatens viggo into revealing iosef's location in a safe house. john attacks the safe house and kills iosef. marcus encourages john to return to his everyday life. perkins witnesses this and reveals marcus's duplicity to viggo, who has him tortured and killed. viggo calls john to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city. winston has perkins executed for breaking the continental's rules, then informs john that viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. john races to new york harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds viggo. john, resigned to dying from his injuries, watches on his phone a video of helen telling him they need to go home. he breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pit bull puppy scheduled to be euthanize before beginning to walk home."

Viggo learns of his son’s actions, berates Iosef, and reveals John was once his most feared enforcer — known as the “Baba Yaga” — who left the life after falling in love with Helen. John recovers a hidden cache of weapons and gold coins from a concealed locker and begins retaliating: he kills the hit team sent to his home. Viggo places a $2 million bounty on John and hires Marcus, John’s old friend and mentor, and also sends a ruthless assassin, Ms. Perkins. John checks into the Continental hotel (neutral ground for assassins) where owner Winston warns him Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John assaults the club but is ambushed by Viggo’s henchman Kirill and forced to withdraw. Ms. Perkins infiltrates John’s Continental room; Marcus notices and fires a warning shot to wake John, who captures Perkins. Viggo doubles the bounty and hides cash/blackmail in a church; John destroys Viggo’s cache there. Viggo retaliates: John is hit by Kirill’s car and captured, but Marcus intervenes and helps John escape; John kills Kirill and forces Viggo to reveal Iosef’s safehouse. John attacks the safehouse and kills Iosef. Ms. Perkins betrays Marcus’s role to Viggo; Viggo tortures and murders Marcus. Ms. Perkins is later executed by Winston for violating Continental rules. Viggo attempts to flee New York by helicopter; John intercepts him at the harbor, fights Viggo on the docks, and mortally wounds him. Believing he will die from his injuries, John watches a final video message from Helen urging him to go home, then breaks into an animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pit bull that had been scheduled for euthanasia before walking away to begin a new life.",

      "during world war 2, steve rogers tries to enlist but is repeatedly rejected for his frail and sickly condition, however a scientist notes his determination and allows him to be accepted. what steve doesn't know is that this scientist is in charge of a government project to create super soldiers, in which steve is to be the first, but the colonel in charge of the project can't see what the scientist does in this scrawny runt - a strong inner character. meanwhile, johann schmidt, head of a german science division known as hydra, knows this scientist and fears the success of his project in america. it could mean trouble for the germans, so he sends a man to infiltrate and see if it's a success, and \"take care\" of the scientist if it is. it is, and he does, but not without steve and his new abilities chasing him down. with the doctor dead, no more american supermen will be forthcoming, and steve quickly becomes a mere u.s. war drive propaganda tool called \"captain america.\" his role is useful, if undignified, but he soldiers on with it dutifully till hearing of his best friend's unit's capture, for which he promptly heads out to rescue them. during this rescue, he meets the diabolical schmidt, and the two become each other's arch nemesis.",

      "captain america is excavated from a crashed plane along with his shield.\njohann schmidt (hugo weaving), a high-ranking nazi, in search of a glass cube (the tesseract). jonhann is the top-ranking scientist in nazi germany, working on superpowers from the occult. he finds the tesseract in norway. in new york, steve rogers (chris evans) is a thin asthmatic found ineligible for us military service. he friend james \"bucky\" barnes has been accepted & is accepted to 107th infantry. dr. abraham erskine (stanley tucci) notices steve, & his determination despite his appearance. he is also on the recruitment board & accepts steve when he applies next. meanwhile johann works with arnim zola to harness the power of the cube to create energy weapons. they are both part of hydra which earlier operated under nazi, but to grow further johann terminates his association to hitler & goes independent. erskine takes steve for basic training under colonel chester phillips (tommy lee jones). chester is supervising erskine's super soldier program. peggy carter (haley atwell) is a british officer on the platoon. despite being smallest & weakest, steve impresses all with his spirit and selflessness.\nerskine reveals to steve that he worked with johann earlier to create a serum that gives man superhuman strength. when erskine used it on johann it backfired & left him as a sinewy red skeleton. thats when erskine had to flee & join the us. erskine performs the procedure on steve instantly transforming him into a super soldier. a nazi spy kills erskine & steals the last serum & escapes. steve runs after the perpetrator & captures him, but the perpetrator swallows the vial of cyanide & kills himself. he has a tattoo of hydra on himself. as chester & peggy conduct their investigation, steve is enlisted by a senator to raise funds for the bond as a comic superhero captain america. he is taken overseas where he meets chester & peggy & finds that the 107th has been captured by hydra. eager to save bucky, steve wants to go in. howard is a private defense contractor and friend of peggy. when chester refuses to help steve, howard air drops steve behind enemy lines & near hydra's weapons plant. steve comes face to face with johann & sees his red skull face. johann escapes with arnim, & steve destroys the base & finds a map with the location of rest of hydra's bases. he rescues bucky & 500 other men of the 107th. they return with the recovered weapons, much to the astonishment of chester. chester offers help to steve to pursue johann, but steve prefers the same team & the rescued prisoners who helped him in their first attack on hydra. howard gives steve a shield made of vibranium. lighter than steel & the strongest metal on earth. peggy is attracted to steve but finds him kissing another gi & is angry. steve manages to destroy many bases of hydra & even captures arnim on his journey through the swiss alps. but bucky dies in that operation. arnim reveals the location of hydra's last base.\nsteve goes headfirst into the base & is captured & brought in front of johann. the rest of the team attacks with surprise. johann has created a plane & stacked it with super bombs with the name of each major city in us. he takes off. steve pursues & kisses peggy before he jumps on the plane.\nthe plane is powered by the cube. steve destroys the cube console. as the cube escapes, it opens a space portal & johann is swept into it & disintegrated.\nsteve realizes that the plane is on auto pilot. he radios peggy & begs his forgiveness & dives the plane into the ocean. steve awakens in a 1940's hospital. an old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a dodger game. he gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. a young woman (amanda righetti) who bears a striking resemblance to peggy enters. she waits for a response from steve, who suspiciously looks at her. he asks why the radio is playing a mets game from may 1941... a game that he was at. she reaches into her pocket and withdraws a walky-talky. two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and steve easily tosses them through a wall. steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that he was on a movie-set. he runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open and appears in a modern skyscraper, bustling with people in business suits. he flees the building and finds himself in 2011's time square. he peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black suvs encircle him. nicky fury (samuel l jackson) steps out and carefully speaks to steve. he tells him that he's been asleep, in ice, for 70 years. the hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. still perplexed, steve breathes heavily and sadly tells fury that he had a date.\nin a post credit scene, steve is in an old-fashioned gym. he pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off it's chain and sends it flying across the room. fury enters the gym and asks steve if he's had trouble sleeping. steve cynically asks if fury has come with another mission. fury replies to the positive. suddenly we see images of all the superheroes, thor, tony stark (from the 'ironman' movies), hawkeye, black widow, bruce banner (from 'hulk') and other shield agents preparing for battle. fury, tells him that \"they're up.\" his personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete... and to be continued."

      "plot_summary": "In 1942 New York, frail but determined Steve Rogers repeatedly fails military enlistment. Dr. Abraham Erskine selects him for Project Rebirth after noticing his courage; in a lab supervised by Colonel Chester Phillips and attended by British officer Peggy Carter, Erskine administers an experimental super-soldier serum and irradiates Steve, transforming him into a peak human physical specimen. After the transformation Erskine is assassinated by a Hydra spy working for Johann Schmidt (the Red Skull), who steals the last vial of serum. The spy kills himself before divulging details. The government, led by Senator and military officials, markets Steve as a publicity mascot—“Captain America”—to sell war bonds; frustrated that he cannot fight, Steve accepts the role reluctantly until his friend James “Bucky” Barnes and the 107th Infantry are captured by Hydra.\nHoward Stark covertly supplies Steve with equipment and a prototype vibranium shield; when Colonel Phillips refuses permission, Howard air-drops Steve behind enemy lines. Steve assembles a small team of rescued or volunteer soldiers and begins direct assaults on Hydra installations, destroying weapons plants and rescuing prisoners. He repeatedly clashes with Johann Schmidt, who has become the Red Skull after a previous failed serum experiment, and with Hydra scientist Dr. Arnim Zola, who helps Schmidt weaponize energy from a mysterious artifact—the Tesseract (a glowing cube) found by Schmidt in Norway. Steve’s assaults cripple many Hydra bases; during a Swiss Alps raid Bucky dies when a suspension bridge collapses while they escape.\nSchmidt retreats to a hidden Arctic base and converts a captured bomber into a flying weapons platform powered by the Tesseract and loaded with explosives aimed at major U.S. cities. Steve leads a final infiltration of the base, is captured, then freed by his team. During the confrontation on the bomber, Steve disables the Tesseract’s control console; the artifact opens a dimensional portal that engulfs and disintegrates Schmidt. Realizing the plane will crash and kill thousands, Steve pilots it away from populated areas and crashes into the Arctic ocean. He is presumed dead; the frozen wreckage preserves his body.\nDecades later, S.H.I.E.L.D. recovers the crashed plane and Steve’s frozen body with his intact vibranium shield. Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. revive him and gradually reintroduce him to the modern world (a staged 1940s film-set and then Times Square). Steve learns he has been unconscious for approximately 70 years. In a stinger, Fury shows Steve images of other enhanced individuals and explains S.H.I.E.L.D.’s initiative to assemble them, positioning Steve for future missions.",

      "captain america is excavated from a crashed plane along with his shield.\njohann schmidt (hugo weaving), a high-ranking nazi, in search of a glass cube (the tesseract). jonhann is the top-ranking scientist in nazi germany, working on superpowers from the occult. he finds the tesseract in norway. in new york, steve rogers (chris evans) is a thin asthmatic found ineligible for us military service. he friend james \"bucky\" barnes has been accepted & is accepted to 107th infantry. dr. abraham erskine (stanley tucci) notices steve, & his determination despite his appearance. he is also on the recruitment board & accepts steve when he applies next. meanwhile johann works with arnim zola to harness the power of the cube to create energy weapons. they are both part of hydra which earlier operated under nazi, but to grow further johann terminates his association to hitler & goes independent. erskine takes steve for basic training under colonel chester phillips (tommy lee jones). chester is supervising erskine's super soldier program. peggy carter (haley atwell) is a british officer on the platoon. despite being smallest & weakest, steve impresses all with his spirit and selflessness.\nerskine reveals to steve that he worked with johann earlier to create a serum that gives man superhuman strength. when erskine used it on johann it backfired & left him as a sinewy red skeleton. thats when erskine had to flee & join the us. erskine performs the procedure on steve instantly transforming him into a super soldier. a nazi spy kills erskine & steals the last serum & escapes. steve runs after the perpetrator & captures him, but the perpetrator swallows the vial of cyanide & kills himself. he has a tattoo of hydra on himself. as chester & peggy conduct their investigation, steve is enlisted by a senator to raise funds for the bond as a comic superhero captain america. he is taken overseas where he meets chester & peggy & finds that the 107th has been captured by hydra. eager to save bucky, steve wants to go in. howard is a private defense contractor and friend of peggy. when chester refuses to help steve, howard air drops steve behind enemy lines & near hydra's weapons plant. steve comes face to face with johann & sees his red skull face. johann escapes with arnim, & steve destroys the base & finds a map with the location of rest of hydra's bases. he rescues bucky & 500 other men of the 107th. they return with the recovered weapons, much to the astonishment of chester. chester offers help to steve to pursue johann, but steve prefers the same team & the rescued prisoners who helped him in their first attack on hydra. howard gives steve a shield made of vibranium. lighter than steel & the strongest metal on earth. peggy is attracted to steve but finds him kissing another gi & is angry. steve manages to destroy many bases of hydra & even captures arnim on his journey through the swiss alps. but bucky dies in that operation. arnim reveals the location of hydra's last base.\nsteve goes headfirst into the base & is captured & brought in front of johann. the rest of the team attacks with surprise. johann has created a plane & stacked it with super bombs with the name of each major city in us. he takes off. steve pursues & kisses peggy before he jumps on the plane.\nthe plane is powered by the cube. steve destroys the cube console. as the cube escapes, it opens a space portal & johann is swept into it & disintegrated.\nsteve realizes that the plane is on auto pilot. he radios peggy & begs his forgiveness & dives the plane into the ocean. steve awakens in a 1940's hospital. an old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a dodger game. he gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. a young woman (amanda righetti) who bears a striking resemblance to peggy enters. she waits for a response from steve, who suspiciously looks at her. he asks why the radio is playing a mets game from may 1941... a game that he was at. she reaches into her pocket and withdraws a walky-talky. two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and steve easily tosses them through a wall. steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that he was on a movie-set. he runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open and appears in a modern skyscraper, bustling with people in business suits. he flees the building and finds himself in 2011's time square. he peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black suvs encircle him. nicky fury (samuel l jackson) steps out and carefully speaks to steve. he tells him that he's been asleep, in ice, for 70 years. the hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. still perplexed, steve breathes heavily and sadly tells fury that he had a date.\nin a post credit scene, steve is in an old-fashioned gym. he pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off it's chain and sends it flying across the room. fury enters the gym and asks steve if he's had trouble sleeping. steve cynically asks if fury has come with another mission. fury replies to the positive. suddenly we see images of all the superheroes, thor, tony stark (from the 'ironman' movies), hawkeye, black widow, bruce banner (from 'hulk') and other shield agents preparing for battle. fury, tells him that \"they're up.\" his personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete... and to be continued."

      "it is 1942, america has entered world war ii, and sickly but determined steve rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. everything changes when dr. erskine recruits him for the secret project rebirth. proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. when dr. erskine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of nazi germany's secret hydra research department (headed by johann schmidt, a.k.a. the red skull), rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot; however, when his comrades need him, rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him captain america, and his war against schmidt begins.",
      "during world war 2, steve rogers tries to enlist but is repeatedly rejected for his frail and sickly condition, however a scientist notes his determination and allows him to be accepted. what steve doesn't know is that this scientist is in charge of a government project to create super soldiers, in which steve is to be the first, but the colonel in charge of the project can't see what the scientist does in this scrawny runt - a strong inner character. meanwhile, johann schmidt, head of a german science division known as hydra, knows this scientist and fears the success of his project in america. it could mean trouble for the germans, so he sends a man to infiltrate and see if it's a success, and \"take care\" of the scientist if it is. it is, and he does, but not without steve and his new abilities chasing him down. with the doctor dead, no more american supermen will be forthcoming, and steve quickly becomes a mere u.s. war drive propaganda tool called \"captain america.\" his role is useful, if undignified, but he soldiers on with it dutifully till hearing of his best friend's unit's capture, for which he promptly heads out to rescue them. during this rescue, he meets the diabolical schmidt, and the two become each other's arch nemesis.",
      "at the outset of world war ii, steve rogers wants nothing more than to join the army. the only problem is that he can't pass the physical. he's tried several times under different names without success. dr. abraham erskine notes his eagerness and recruits him for an experimental project. rogers is soon transformed, both mentally and physically, into a super soldier where he eventually faces off against the nazi organization hydra and its head, known as red skull.",
      "steve rogers, a weak, sickly young man eager to fight is repeatedly rejected from the war-until a seemingly \"crazy\" scientist recruits him in a new experiment to turn the tides. he is transformed into the super soldier the world needs, but no one believes it. he is used as an empty face for propaganda until his comrades, including hid best and only friend, are captured by the red skull, a nazi general who wants to use the tesseract for evil. \"captain america\" breaks into red skull's hq with the help of peggy carter and howard stark, and captain america saves everyone. and everyone begins to realize what captain america can really do."

    "synopsis": [
      "on earth-65, police captain george stacy (shea whigham) is unaware that his daughter gwen stacy (hailee steinfeld) is spider-woman, who the police believe to be a murderer (when she failed to save her boyfriend from an alien attack, and was seen leaving the crime scene by the police).\none night, gwen encounters a version of the vulture (jorma taccone) from an italian renaissance-themed alternate universe. vulture had no clue how he ended up into gwen's universe, and had no concept of the multiverse either.\nmiguel o'hara/ spider-man 2099 (oscar isaac) and jess drew/earth-332 (issa rae) arrive using portal-generating watches and help gwen neutralize the vulture.\ngeorge corners gwen, who then reveals her identity to him; distraught, he attempts to arrest her. miguel reluctantly grants gwen membership into the spider-society (an elite strike force dedicated to the security of the universe), allowing her to escape with him and jess. in brooklyn on earth-1610, sixteen months after the alchemax collider's explosion, miles morales (shameik moore) encounters the spot, an alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during the explosion. due to his condition, the spot can simply travel through space at will by opening portals wherever he wants.\nthe spot / johnathon ohnn (jason schwartzman) blames miles for causing his condition and reveals that, while testing the collider, he had transported a spider from another dimension, earth-42, which then bit miles and turned him into spider-man. this incident took a year ago and since then miles has been fighting crime as spider-man. as part of the gig, he encountered his uncle aaron davis, who was a criminal and died in a duel with miles.\nmiles has not revealed his truth to his parents jeff and rio (lauren vélez). he aims to learn quantum physics at princeton university where they are experimenting on moving electrons across dimensional barriers. this way, he believes, he can learn to travel to other dimensions.\nthe spot says that he created spider-man and then the spider-man blew up the collider and turned johnathon into the spot. spot blames spider-man for the loss of his job, his life, his face and his family. the spot then accidentally transports himself into a void, where he learns to travel to other universes containing alchemax colliders to empower himself further. gwen travels to earth-1610 and reconnects with miles while tracking the spot. gwen tells miles about the spider society, who is trying to keep the multiverse from collapsing. gwen says that miles is the only real friend that she made since peter died. gwen says that the society is very strict about where she goes and for how long, else she would have visited sooner. gwen contemplates that in every other universe gwen falls for spider-man and it does not end well.\nmiles wants to join the society, but gwen says that it is a small, elite group and currently has no openings.\ngwen goes to spot's home in this dimension and figures out that he has taken the collider of that world. each collider gives spot more power and now he has the ability to create inter-dimensional portals by himself and control them. gwen and jess track spot to earth-50101. jess blames gwen for taking her eyes off spot to go to meet miles, and gives her an hour to fix the issue. miles secretly follows gwen through a portal to earth-50101, and they team up with local spider-man pavitr prabhakar / spider-man india (karan soni), and later hobie brown / spider-punk (daniel kaluuya), against the spot, who absorbs the power of that world's collider. the spot and miles share a vision of the spot's future attacks that include the deaths of police inspector singh (the father of pavitr's girlfriend gayatri) and miles' father jeff (daniel kaluuya). the spot departs and the collider collapses; miles saves singh from the ensuing destruction, but earth-50101 begins to fall apart from its disrupted \"canon event\" before members of the society arrive to contain the damage.\nmiles, gwen, and hobie are sent to the society's headquarters on earth-928, where hundreds of spider-people reside in a massive complex. miguel is the native spider-man of earth-928 and the founder of the spider-society. miles, along with gwen and hobie, meets with miguel and reunites with peter b. parker (jake johnson), who is accompanied by his infant daughter mayday. miguel explains to miles that each of the spider-people's stories throughout the multiverse contain \"canon events\", such as the deaths of a police captain close to spider-man, and that straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. miguel reveals that he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe. miles realizes that the spot murdering jeff, who is set to be promoted to police captain in two days, is a canon event. miguel imprisons miles to prevent him from saving jeff, but hobie helps miles break loose before quitting the society.\nas miles flees through the complex, miguel orders the society to capture him. hobie refuses to participate and quits the society, leaving earth-928.\nmiguel corners miles and tells him that he is the original anomaly: miles was never supposed to be spider-man, as the spider that bit him came from earth-42, resulting in earth-42 having no spider-man, and that if the spider had not bitten miles, earth-1610's peter parker would have stopped the collider and survived, and the spot would never have existed. miles overpowers miguel and flees to what he believes is his home dimension. the society had a \"go-home\" machine that is used to send the anomalies back to their dimensions. miles activates the machine, to go back home. the machine identifies that target dimension by analyzing the dna of the anomaly.\nconsidering gwen a liability, a furious miguel ejects her from the society and forcibly sends her back to earth-65. once there, gwen reunites with george, who has resigned from his job as police captain. the two reconcile, and george gives gwen a portal watch left by hobie. miles arrives in what he thinks is his home world. when he arrives in his bedroom he shares everything that happened to his mother, rio. he even tells her that he is spider-man. she has no idea who or what spider-man is and continues with the laundry. confused, miles continues to try to explain before \"glitching\". miles realizes that he is on earth-42, the home of the spider that bit him, rather than his own dimension. the go-home machine recognized the spider's signature from earth-42 and sent miles there.\nin this world, his uncle aaron davis (mahershala ali) is alive while his father is dead; because spider-man does not exist, new york city is riddled with unchecked crime. aaron restrains miles and is soon joined by earth-42's miles, who has become the prowler instead of aaron. as the society searches for miles in earth-1610, gwen travels there and speaks with his parents, promising to find him and bring him home.\nthe spot begins his multiversal attack, miles prepares to escape, and gwen assembles a team to find miles, consisting of peter b., mayday, pavitr, hobie, margo kess, spider-man noir, peni parker, and spider-ham."

      "plot_summary": "On Earth-65, Gwen Stacy (Spider-Woman) secretly fights crime while hiding from police led by her father, Captain George Stacy. After an interdimensional Vulture appears, Miguel O'Hara (Spider-Man 2099) and Jessica Drew (Earth-332) arrive using portal watches and help her. Miguel recruits Gwen into the Spider-Society, an elite multiversal strike force based on Earth-928. On Earth-1610 (Brooklyn), Miles Morales balances high school and family expectations while continuing as Spider-Man. The Spot (Jonathan Ohnn), an Alchemax scientist left with portal-like lesions after a collider incident, blames Spider-Man for his condition and reveals that a spider transplanted from another universe (Earth-42) bit Miles. The Spot learns to travel between worlds by absorbing power from colliders and begins attacking colliders across realities to grow stronger.\nGwen returns to Earth-1610 to track the Spot and reconnects with Miles. Miles wants to join the Spider-Society; Gwen explains it is elite with no openings. The Spot steals a world's collider on Earth-50101; Miles secretly follows Gwen and they team with Pavitr Prabhakar (Spider-Man India) and Hobie Brown (Spider-Punk) to stop him. The Spot shares visions of future deaths — including Inspector Singh and Miles's father, Jeff — and collapses that world's collider. Miles saves Singh but the world starts to fail. Society members arrive to contain the damage and take Miles, Gwen, and Hobie to Earth-928 headquarters.\nAt the Spider-Society complex, Miguel explains \"canon events\": recurring pivotal occurrences (like a close cop's death) that must happen in each universe to keep reality stable. Miguel claims Miles is an anomaly: the spider that bit Miles came from Earth-42, meaning Earth-1610's history diverged and Miles's existence threatens the multiverse. Miguel says altering canon events causes universes to collapse; he shows Miles the consequences and imprisons him to prevent Miles saving Jeff. Hobie refuses to enforce Miguel's orders and helps Miles escape but then quits the Society.\nMiles flees through the complex while Miguel orders every Spider-Person to capture him. Miguel confronts Miles, accusing him of being the original cause of instability because Earth-42 now lacks a Spider-Man and Earth-1610's Peter might have survived if Miles had not been bitten. Miles overpowers guards and accesses the Society's \"go-home\" machine. He activates it to return to his home, but the machine home-targets the spider's DNA signature and sends Miles to Earth-42 instead.\nOn Earth-65, Miguel deports Gwen from the Society for breaking rules; she returns to reconcile with her father, who has resigned his post, and receives a portal watch left by Hobie. On Earth-42 Miles arrives expecting home: he confesses being Spider-Man to his mother Rio, who doesn't recognize the concept, then realizes he's on Earth-42 when he \"glitches.\" In Earth-42, Miles's Uncle Aaron is alive and his own father is dead. Aaron restrains Miles; the native Earth-42 Miles has become the Prowler (the criminal role Aaron had in Miles's original world) and confronts him. Back on Earth-1610, Gwen promises Miles's parents she'll find him.\nMeanwhile, the Spot escalates his multiversal campaign by attacking more colliders to amplify his portal power. Miguel labels Miles an existential threat and mobilizes the Society to apprehend him across worlds. Gwen assembles a retrieval team — including Peter B. Parker and his infant Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, Margo Kess, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham — to track Miles and stop the Spot. The film ends with Miles trapped between worlds (imprisoned by his alternate family's dynamics and hunted by his counterpart), the Spot's war on colliders continuing, and the Spider-Society divided between Miguel's rigid enforcement of canon events and members who question his absolute methods, setting up an escalating multiversal conflict.",

distraught, he attempts to arrest her. miguel reluctantly grants gwen membership into the spider-society (an elite strike force dedicated to the security of the universe), allowing her to escape with him and jess. in brooklyn on earth-1610, sixteen months after the alchemax collider's explosion, miles morales (shameik moore) encounters the spot, an alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during the explosion. due to his condition, the spot can simply travel through space at will by opening portals wherever he wants.\nthe spot / johnathon ohnn (jason schwartzman) blames miles for causing his condition and reveals that, while testing the collider, he had transported a spider from another dimension, earth-42, which then bit miles and turned him into spider-man. this incident took a year ago and since then miles has been fighting crime as spider-man. as part of the gig, he encountered his uncle aaron davis, who was a criminal and died in a duel with miles.\nmiles has not revealed his truth to his parents jeff and rio (lauren vélez). he aims to learn quantum physics at princeton university where they are experimenting on moving electrons across dimensional barriers. this way, he believes, he can learn to travel to other dimensions.\nthe spot says that he created spider-man and then the spider-man blew up the collider and turned johnathon into the spot. spot blames spider-man for the loss of his job, his life, his face and his family. the spot then accidentally transports himself into a void, where he learns to travel to other universes containing alchemax colliders to empower himself further. gwen travels to earth-1610 and reconnects with miles while tracking the spot. gwen tells miles about the spider society, who is trying to keep the multiverse from collapsing. gwen says that miles is the only real friend that she made since peter died. gwen says that the society is very strict about where she goes and for how long, else she would have visited sooner. gwen contemplates that in every other universe gwen falls for spider-man and it does not end well.\nmiles wants to join the society, but gwen says that it is a small, elite group and currently has no openings.\ngwen goes to spot's home in this dimension and figures out that he has taken the collider of that world. each collider gives spot more power and now he has the ability to create inter-dimensional portals by himself and control them. gwen and jess track spot to earth-50101. jess blames gwen for taking her eyes off spot to go to meet miles, and gives her an hour to fix the issue. miles secretly follows gwen through a portal to earth-50101, and they team up with local spider-man pavitr prabhakar / spider-man india (karan soni), and later hobie brown / spider-punk (daniel kaluuya), against the spot, who absorbs the power of that world's collider. the spot and miles share a vision of the spot's future attacks that include the deaths of police inspector singh (the father of pavitr's girlfriend gayatri) and miles' father jeff (daniel kaluuya). the spot departs and the collider collapses; miles saves singh from the ensuing destruction, but earth-50101 begins to fall apart from its disrupted \"canon event\" before members of the society arrive to contain the damage.\nmiles, gwen, and hobie are sent to the society's headquarters on earth-928, where hundreds of spider-people reside in a massive complex. miguel is the native spider-man of earth-928 and the founder of the spider-society. miles, along with gwen and hobie, meets with miguel and reunites with peter b. parker (jake johnson), who is accompanied by his infant daughter mayday. miguel explains to miles that each of the spider-people's stories throughout the multiverse contain \"canon events\", such as the deaths of a police captain close to spider-man, and that straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. miguel reveals that he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe. miles realizes that the spot murdering jeff, who is set to be promoted to police captain in two days, is a canon event. miguel imprisons miles to prevent him from saving jeff, but hobie helps miles break loose before quitting the society.\nas miles flees through the complex, miguel orders the society to capture him. hobie refuses to participate and quits the society, leaving earth-928.\nmiguel corners miles and tells him that he is the original anomaly: miles was never supposed to be spider-man, as the spider that bit him came from earth-42, resulting in earth-42 having no spider-man, and that if the spider had not bitten miles, earth-1610's peter parker would have stopped the collider and survived, and the spot would never have existed. miles overpowers miguel and flees to what he believes is his home dimension. the society had a \"go-home\" machine that is used to send the anomalies back to their dimensions. miles activates the machine, to go back home. the machine identifies that target dimension by analyzing the dna of the anomaly.\nconsidering gwen a liability, a furious miguel ejects her from the society and forcibly sends her back to earth-65. once there, gwen reunites with george, who has resigned from his job as police captain. the two reconcile, and george gives gwen a portal watch left by hobie. miles arrives in what he thinks is his home world. when he arrives in his bedroom he shares everything that happened to his mother, rio. he even tells her that he is spider-man. she has no idea who or what spider-man is and continues with the laundry. confused, miles continues to try to explain before \"glitching\". miles realizes that he is on earth-42, the home of the spider that bit him, rather than his own dimension. the go-home machine recognized the spider's signature from earth-42 and sent miles there.\nin this world, his uncle aaron davis (mahershala ali) is alive while his father is dead; because spider-man does not exist, new york city is riddled with unchecked crime. aaron restrains miles and is soon joined by earth-42's miles, who has become the prowler instead of aaron. as the society searches for miles in earth-1610, gwen travels there and speaks with his parents, promising to find him and bring him home.\nthe spot begins his multiversal attack, miles prepares to escape, and gwen assembles a team to find miles, consisting of peter b., mayday, pavitr, hobie, margo kess, spider-man noir, peni parker, and spider-ham."

      "in 2018 clint barton, who is under house arrest following his actions during the avengers civil war, guides his daughter lila in archery at his homestead while his wife laura and his two sons prepare a picnic. suddenly, lila vanishes into ash, leaving a panicked clint alive and alone. in the three weeks since thanos decimated half the universe's population with a snap of his fingers, tony stark and nebula are adrift in space on the benatar, their fuel and supplies dwindling. as stark, still injured from his fight with thanos and close to starving to death, records a message for his fiancée pepper potts in preparation for his demise, carol danvers locates the disabled spaceship and brings them back to earth. stark reunites with potts, steve rogers, natasha romanoff, bruce banner and james rhodes; rocket raccoon joins nebula as they mourn the fall of their fellow guardians of the galaxy. stark furiously confronts rogers accusing him of being the one who disbanded the avengers and as a result they were unable to stand united during their conflict with the mad titan. he questions why the avengers only do their best after the worst has already come to pass. tony passes out due to exhaustion. with a tip from nebula about her father's location, along with a snap-like energy signature that was detected two days prior, the team head into space for the garden, intending to take the infinity stones back and reverse the destruction. they discover thanos, now horribly scarred, alone and undefended, cooking a meal. they launch an ambush, quickly pinning him down and cutting off the arm wearing the infinity gauntlet. it has been emptied of its stones. thanos reveals that he had destroyed them using their own powers, which nearly killed him, as he considered his work done and wanted to remove the temptation of using them again. although suspected of lying by rhodes, nebula vouches for her father, as he is never a liar. surprised by the affirmation, thanos reconsiders his torturous treatment of his daughter, but he is then immediately beheaded by thor. although the mad titan is dead, they have failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his victims and have no choice but to accept defeat. five years pass, and the surviving population have yet to cope with their losses. rogers now runs a support group for people to try help them come to terms with what happened. stark and pepper potts are now married and are living in a remote cabin with their daughter morgan. in san francisco, scott lang escapes from the quantum realm when a rat activates controls left behind by the van dyne family before they vanished. lang wanders through the disheveled city and realizes something terrible has happened. he approaches the wall of the vanished, a massive memorial containing the names of everyone in the city who vanished in the snap. he frantically searches it hoping to not find cassie's name, only to find his own (as no-one remaining knew what happened to him). scott rushes to cassie's house and finds that she is now five years older and a teenager. father and daughter tearfully reunite. at the avengers compound, romanoff now commands the the team as they perform various assignments. rhodes informs her of a recent mexican cartel massacre carried out by the still grief-stricken barton, expressing his concern over how far their former comrade had fallen. barton has been on an assassination rampage that's taken him around the world. lang arrives at the compound and reveals to romanoff and rogers that although five years had passed, he only spent five hours in the realm. he proposes that they could find a way to exploit the realm's time-bending nature to travel into the past and retrieve the stones from different times. but since the three have no knowledge of quantum physics, they seek out stark. initially declining to help them, as he believes it would mean putting his daughter morgan in danger of being erased from existence, stark later decides to spring into action after coming across an old photo of him and his late protégé peter parker. he successfully develops a time-space gps device based on an inverted möbius strip. stark consults with potts on his new discovery, who encourages him to do what's right for everyone else. meanwhile, the other avengers recruit banner, who merged his intellect with hulk's physique, to run time travel tests on lang using the quantum tunnel housed in his van. the experiment does not turn out as expected, as lang constantly shifts between different ages. afterward, stark arrives at the facility with the gps and returns rogers' shield to him, signifying their reconciliation, but makes it clear he won't sacrifice his daughter to undo what thanos did. rogers agrees. the remaining avengers begin to regroup. as nebula returns to new york, banner and rocket travel to new asgard and recruit thor, who has become an overweight, depressed and lazy drunkard, traumatized with his perceived failure to stop thanos. romanoff goes to tokyo and finds barton, who has massacred a group of yakuza as part of his vengeful crusade against criminals who survived the snap. rocket and stark build a time machine, while barton volunteers to submit himself for a test run into the past. grabbing a baseball mitt from his homestead, he successfully carries it back to the present as evidence that their plan works. in the past, he hears the voice of his daughter lila but returns to the future before he can interact with his family. the avengers plan out their time heist, using points from their past to pinpoint locations for the infinity stones: romanoff realizes that the space, mind, and time stones can be found in 2012 new york. the reality stone is in 2013 on asgard, and the power and soul stones on morag and vormir respectively can be found in 2014. they split into three teams and travel back in time to begin their missions, mindful that they only have a finite amount of pym particles since hank pym also perished in the snap. rogers, stark, banner and lang arrive in an alternate 2012 in the midst of the battle of new york. banner approaches the new york sanctum and finds the ancient one, who refuses to lend the time stone to him. however, she relents after learning that doctor strange had surrendered it to thanos in the future, knowing strange wouldn't have done so if there wasn't a grave reason. at stark tower, lang and stark attempt to steal the tesseract, but loses it to loki, who uses it to teleport away. rogers obtains the scepter from strike possession by feigning hydra affiliation, but is forced to fight his 2012 self who confuses him for loki. after defeating his past self, rogers rendezvous with stark and lang. with only enough pym particles for one more trip each, stark and rogers decide to go back further to camp lehigh to an alternate 1970, where they have another shot at obtaining the tesseract and more pym particles. lang is left with the scepter to return to the present day. at the s.h.i.e.l.d. base, rogers stealthily obtains the particles from hank pym, but runs into peggy carter's office while evading security. he tearfully watches her as she works in her office. meanwhile, stark encounters his father howard after obtaining the tesseract. with the latter's wife maria expecting a baby, tony (under the guise of \"howard potts\") offers parenting advice, saying that the good times he had with his father are all that mattered. before they part ways, tony hugs his alternate father, having finally obtained his closure. arriving on asgard in an alternate 2013, thor experiences a panic attack after seeing his mother frigga, recalling this is the day of her demise. rocket encourages him to settle his grief and help him extract the aether from jane foster's body, but thor runs away, leaving the raccoon to do it himself. thor unsuccessfully attempts to hide from frigga and runs into her, who knows that her alternate son is from the future. sharing a talk, frigga lectures her son on the importance of failure, advising him to follow his own path rather than try and live up to what he was supposed to be. thor attempts to warn his mother about her impending death, but she silences him. as rocket returns with the aether in hand, thor shares one last hug with frigga before reaching out to retrieve mjølnir, finding that he remains worthy of wielding the hammer. in an alternate 2014, barton and romanoff board the benatar for vormir, while nebula and rhodes remain on morag and wait for peter quill to arrive and lead them to the orb's chamber. they knock quill out and collect the stone, but when the two attempt to travel back, nebula is left behind when her memories are entangled with those of her past self. the thanos of that time uses the link to see into the future, learning that the same humans who had foiled his 2012 invasion are returning to reverse his ultimate victory. determined to know more, thanos captures nebula as she attempts to warn barton and romanoff of his newfound involvement. past nebula confronts her future self and collects her gps device and pym particles, handing it over to her father. meanwhile, barton and romanoff arrive on vormir. they meet red skull, who informs them that the sacrifice of a loved one must be carried out in order for one to retrieve the stone. barton laughs at the concept, but romanoff deduces that it is indeed the truth, as thanos had murdered his daughter gamora there in their time. understanding the severity of the situation, the two struggle to decide who should give their life for the cause; while barton insists he should do it due to the carnage he left behind in the wake of his grief, romanoff declares that her life's work has led her to this moment. as they dash to the cliff, they wrestle to keep each other away from sacrificing themselves. ultimately, romanoff makes the jump and dies, leaving the soul stone with the grief-stricken barton. the avengers return to the present day. reeling from the loss of one of their own, they realize that her death cannot be undone, and that their efforts to save the universe must not leave her death in vain. they construct a new gauntlet using tony's mark suit technology and load the six stones onto it. thor volunteers to perform the snap, but banner steps in, saying he's the only one strong enough to withstand the stones' radiation, which is gamma in nature, similar to his own. while severely scarring his arm, he successfully snaps his fingers and brings the victims of the snap back to life. elsewhere, past nebula - who traveled to the present in place of her future self - opens the avengers' time portal, allowing thanos to bring his ship, the sanctuary ii, forward from 2014. the avengers barely have time to celebrate their success when the ship abruptly opens fire on the compound with a barrage of missiles, reducing the facility to rubble. as thanos sends past nebula to retrieve the stones, her future self reveals to gamora that their relationship in the future became one of friendship and more. gamora decides to join nebula to stop her father. meanwhile, rhodes, rocket and banner are trapped in a flooding area under the rubble, prompting lang to come to their rescue. barton lands next to the gauntlet in the sewer, which is infested with outriders. after escaping them, he unknowingly passes the apparatus to past nebula, who is then confronted by gamora and nebula; the latter kills her past self once she threatens her sister. stark, rogers and thor confront thanos on the ground, who intends to rebuild the entire universe using the stones, a universe where the new living beings will live in peace without knowledge of the past. after stark and thor are overpowered in the ensuing fight, rogers wields mjølnir against the time-displaced titan. however, thanos eventually defeats rogers, severely injuring him and nearly destroys his shield, hacking viciously away at it with his sword. thanos summons the rest of his army, which include the chitauri and the black order, to lay siege on earth. just as rogers prepares to face them alone, he hears sam wilson contacting him through his earpiece. a series of sling ring portals appear behind him. the masters of the mystic arts have arrived with reinforcements from kamar-taj, wakanda, contraxia and new asgard, along with the avengers' resurrected allies from wakanda, titan and san francisco. lang, growing to giant size, retrieves banner, rhodes and rocket from the flooded depths of the destroyed compound. with the scales now balanced, rogers calls for the avengers to assemble and leads his allies into the battle for the fate of the universe. banner tells barton that they must get the stones back to their respective times and away from thanos. with their main time machine destroyed in the initial attack, their only other option is the van; ant-man and wasp jump to hot-wire the dead vehicle. as thanos' forces close in on barton. he passes the gauntlet onto black panther. as thanos prepares to charge at t'challa, he suddenly finds his path blocked by a vengeful wanda maximoff, seeking revenge for his 2018 self's murder of vision. as wanda engages thanos, t'challa runs, only to become entrapped by ebony maw. seeing t'challa's predicament, spider-man swoops in and snatches the gauntlet. meanwhile, wanda's attacks leave thanos at her mercy, as she effortlessly breaks his sword and lifts him into the air while ripping chunks of armor from his body. in order to escape her grasp, thanos orders another missile barrage from sanctuary ii (against corvus glaive's protests) that deals great damage to both sides. one of the missiles takes out a dam, forcing doctor strange out of the fight to prevent the battlefield from flooding. suddenly, sanctuary ii redirects its fire to a target arriving from outer space. it is carol danvers, who comes to single-handedly destroy the warship. retrieving the gauntlet from parker, she enlists the aid of her fellow female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated van. however, thanos uses his sword to destroy the vehicle and the quantum portal. with the gauntlet in thanos' reach, stark, rogers, thor and danvers make their last stand to keep it out of his hands. however, he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and equip the gauntlet. strange signals stark with one shaking finger that this is the one future that ends in their victory. determined, stark dashes at thanos one last time, grappling with the gauntlet on the titan's hand, but he is knocked aside as the titan snaps his fingers. nothing happens, as the stones have been stolen by stark and transferred onto his hand with the suit's nanotech. with the very being that has haunted him for the past eleven years now at his mercy and declaring \"i am ironman!\", stark snaps his own fingers in a large flash of white light. thanos, realizing he's been beaten, watches in horror as his own forces crumble to dust in front of him, only to meet that same fate soon after. stark is mortally wounded from his usage of the stones, and is greeted by rhodes, parker and potts as he lays dying. potts assures her husband that they are going to be alright, and allows him to rest. stark's arc reactor then permanently shuts off, potts giving him one last kiss. rogers and thor mournfully watch at a distance. the mad titan's final defeat and the return of the vanished calls for celebrations all around the world, including in wakanda and san francisco. parker reunites at school with his best friend ned. lang watches the celebration with hope and cassie. at stark's funeral, he leaves a final holographic message for his family and closest friends, including a heartfelt goodbye for morgan. stark's mark i arc reactor is set adrift in the lake outside their cabin, with the avengers and their allies in attendance, including those who had past grievances with stark, such as the pym family, wanda, and bucky barnes. outside new asgard, thor, following his mother's advice, names valkyrie as the new ruler while he abdicates to join the guardians of the galaxy. meanwhile, rogers prepares to go back in time to return the stones and mjølnir, bidding goodbye to barnes. as banner is unable to bring him back when prompted, barnes alerts sam wilson to the presence of an elderly man nearby. it is an aged rogers, who had chosen to remain in the past and live out a full life with peggy carter, a fact he gently refuses to reveal to wilson. he presents wilson with a new shield, passing the mantle of captain america on to him. in the past, peggy and steve dance together in the living room of a suburban house to their song \"it's

      "plot_summary": "In 2018, Clint Barton (Hawkeye) loses his daughter Lila to Thanos's snap and becomes a vengeance-driven assassin. Tony Stark and Nebula are adrift in space on the Benatar after the snap; Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) rescues them and returns them to Earth. The remaining Avengers — Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, James Rhodes, Rocket, Nebula and others — travel to Thanos's garden to take the Infinity Stones. They find Thanos badly scarred; he reveals he destroyed the stones and is beheaded by Thor after cutting off the gauntlet arm. Five years later, society struggles. Scott Lang (Ant-Man) escapes the quantum realm and reunites with his daughter Cassie; he proposes using the quantum realm’s time-dilation to retrieve the stones from past timelines. After initial reluctance, Stark, with Rocket and Banner's help, develops time-travel technology using Pym particles and a GPS. The team recruits Thor (now depressed and living in New Asgard), and Clint is returned from his murderous spree. They plan a \"time heist\": teams will travel to specific past points to collect each Infinity Stone — 2012 New York (Space, Mind, Time), 2013 Asgard (Reality/aether), 2014 Morag (Power) and Vormir (Soul), and 1970 Camp Lehigh (to retrieve more Pym particles and the Tesseract). Rogers, Stark, Banner and Lang go to 2012 New York. Banner meets the Ancient One and secures the Time Stone after convincing her of Strange's choice; Stark and Lang attempt to steal the Tesseract but Loki escapes with it; Rogers fights his 2012 self and takes the Scepter. Stark and Rogers then go to 1970 to obtain the Tesseract and Pym particles; Stark meets his father Howard and gains emotional closure. Thor, Rocket and Rhodey go to 2013 Asgard to extract the Aether from Jane Foster; Thor has a final conversation with his mother Frigga, retrieves Mjolnir and regains worthiness. Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton travel to Vormir where Red Skull reveals that retrieving the Soul Stone requires the sacrifice of a loved one; after a struggle about who should die, Natasha sacrifices herself so Clint can obtain the Soul Stone. Nebula and Rhodes (with Quill briefly) go to Morag to take the Power Stone; due to a cybernetic link, past Thanos learns of the Avengers' plan through Nebula and uses that information to infiltrate the present. The teams return to 2023 with the stones (except Loki’s 2012 escape creates an alternate timeline). Banner performs a gamma-protected snap using a rebuilt gauntlet and the stones, restoring everyone wiped by Thanos. A past-2014 Thanos, having used Nebula's link to the future, locates the Avengers' base in the present and brings his army through a time portal, attacking the compound. Thanos's forces bombard the compound; Sanctuary II fires missiles but is destroyed by Carol Danvers. A massive battle ensues on the ruined compound and surrounding battlefield. The gauntlet exchanges hands amid chaotic fighting — T'Challa, Spider-Man, Wanda Maximoff, Shuri and others intervene. Wanda nearly kills Thanos while avenging Vision. Past-Thanos ultimately obtains the gauntlet; Doctor Strange signals Tony Stark that only one path leads to victory. Stark's armor nanotech transfers the stones to his suit; he declares \"I am Iron Man\" and snaps, disintegrating Thanos and his army but fatally injuring himself. Stark dies surrounded by Pepper Potts, Peter Parker and Rhodes; the world celebrates the return of the vanished. At Stark’s funeral, heroes and allies attend. Thor names Valkyrie ruler of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers uses the quantum method to return the stones to their original timelines and also returns Mjolnir; instead of immediately returning, he remains in the past, lives a full life with Peggy Carter, and returns as an elderly man to pass his shield to Sam Wilson, effectively retiring as Captain America.",

      "in 2018 clint barton, who is under house arrest following his actions during the avengers civil war, guides his daughter lila in archery at his homestead while his wife laura and his two sons prepare a picnic. suddenly, lila vanishes into ash, leaving a panicked clint alive and alone. in the three weeks since thanos decimated half the universe's population with a snap of his fingers, tony stark and nebula are adrift in space on the benatar, their fuel and supplies dwindling. as stark, still injured from his fight with thanos and close to starving to death, records a message for his fiancée pepper potts in preparation for his demise, carol danvers locates the disabled spaceship and brings them back to earth. stark reunites with potts, steve rogers, natasha romanoff, bruce banner and james rhodes; rocket raccoon joins nebula as they mourn the fall of their fellow guardians of the galaxy. stark furiously confronts rogers accusing him of being the one who disbanded the avengers and as a result they were unable to stand united during their conflict with the mad titan. he questions why the avengers only do their best after the worst has already come to pass. tony passes out due to exhaustion. with a tip from nebula about her father's location, along with a snap-like energy signature that was detected two days prior, the team head into space for the garden, intending to take the infinity stones back and reverse the destruction. they discover thanos, now horribly scarred, alone and undefended, cooking a meal. they launch an ambush, quickly pinning him down and cutting off the arm wearing the infinity gauntlet. it has been emptied of its stones. thanos reveals that he had destroyed them using their own powers, which nearly killed him, as he considered his work done and wanted to remove the temptation of using them again. although suspected of lying by rhodes, nebula vouches for her father, as he is never a liar. surprised by the affirmation, thanos reconsiders his torturous treatment of his daughter, but he is then immediately beheaded by thor. although the mad titan is dead, they have failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his victims and have no choice but to accept defeat. five years pass, and the surviving population have yet to cope with their losses. rogers now runs a support group for people to try help them come to terms with what happened. stark and pepper potts are now married and are living in a remote cabin with their daughter morgan. in san francisco, scott lang escapes from the quantum realm when a rat activates controls left behind by the van dyne family before they vanished. lang wanders through the disheveled city and realizes something terrible has happened. he approaches the wall of the vanished, a massive memorial containing the names of everyone in the city who vanished in the snap. he frantically searches it hoping to not find cassie's name, only to find his own (as no-one remaining knew what happened to him). scott rushes to cassie's house and finds that she is now five years older and a teenager. father and daughter tearfully reunite. at the avengers compound, romanoff now commands the the team as they perform various assignments. rhodes informs her of a recent mexican cartel massacre carried out by the still grief-stricken barton, expressing his concern over how far their former comrade had fallen. barton has been on an assassination rampage that's taken him around the world. lang arrives at the compound and reveals to romanoff and rogers that although five years had passed, he only spent five hours in the realm. he proposes that they could find a way to exploit the realm's time-bending nature to travel into the past and retrieve the stones from different times. but since the three have no knowledge of quantum physics, they seek out stark. initially declining to help them, as he believes it would mean putting his daughter morgan in danger of being erased from existence, stark later decides to spring into action after coming across an old photo of him and his late protégé peter parker. he successfully develops a time-space gps device based on an inverted möbius strip. stark consults with potts on his new discovery, who encourages him to do what's right for everyone else. meanwhile, the other avengers recruit banner, who merged his intellect with hulk's physique, to run time travel tests on lang using the quantum tunnel housed in his van. the experiment does not turn out as expected, as lang constantly shifts between different ages. afterward, stark arrives at the facility with the gps and returns rogers' shield to him, signifying their reconciliation, but makes it clear he won't sacrifice his daughter to undo what thanos did. rogers agrees. the remaining avengers begin to regroup. as nebula returns to new york, banner and rocket travel to new asgard and recruit thor, who has become an overweight, depressed and lazy drunkard, traumatized with his perceived failure to stop thanos. romanoff goes to tokyo and finds barton, who has massacred a group of yakuza as part of his vengeful crusade against criminals who survived the snap. rocket and stark build a time machine, while barton volunteers to submit himself for a test run into the past. grabbing a baseball mitt from his homestead, he successfully carries it back to the present as evidence that their plan works. in the past, he hears the voice of his daughter lila but returns to the future before he can interact with his family. the avengers plan out their time heist, using points from their past to pinpoint locations for the infinity stones: romanoff realizes that the space, mind, and time stones can be found in 2012 new york. the reality stone is in 2013 on asgard, and the power and soul stones on morag and vormir respectively can be found in 2014. they split into three teams and travel back in time to begin their missions, mindful that they only have a finite amount of pym particles since hank pym also perished in the snap. rogers, stark, banner and lang arrive in an alternate 2012 in the midst of the battle of new york. banner approaches the new york sanctum and finds the ancient one, who refuses to lend the time stone to him. however, she relents after learning that doctor strange had surrendered it to thanos in the future, knowing strange wouldn't have done so if there wasn't a grave reason. at stark tower, lang and stark attempt to steal the tesseract, but loses it to loki, who uses it to teleport away. rogers obtains the scepter from strike possession by feigning hydra affiliation, but is forced to fight his 2012 self who confuses him for loki. after defeating his past self, rogers rendezvous with stark and lang. with only enough pym particles for one more trip each, stark and rogers decide to go back further to camp lehigh to an alternate 1970, where they have another shot at obtaining the tesseract and more pym particles. lang is left with the scepter to return to the present day. at the s.h.i.e.l.d. base, rogers stealthily obtains the particles from hank pym, but runs into peggy carter's office while evading security. he tearfully watches her as she works in her office. meanwhile, stark encounters his father howard after obtaining the tesseract. with the latter's wife maria expecting a baby, tony (under the guise of \"howard potts\") offers parenting advice, saying that the good times he had with his father are all that mattered. before they part ways, tony hugs his alternate father, having finally obtained his closure. arriving on asgard in an alternate 2013, thor experiences a panic attack after seeing his mother frigga, recalling this is the day of her demise. rocket encourages him to settle his grief and help him extract the aether from jane foster's body, but thor runs away, leaving the raccoon to do it himself. thor unsuccessfully attempts to hide from frigga and runs into her, who knows that her alternate son is from the future. sharing a talk, frigga lectures her son on the importance of failure, advising him to follow his own path rather than try and live up to what he was supposed to be. thor attempts to warn his mother about her impending death, but she silences him. as rocket returns with the aether in hand, thor shares one last hug with frigga before reaching out to retrieve mjølnir, finding that he remains worthy of wielding the hammer. in an alternate 2014, barton and romanoff board the benatar for vormir, while nebula and rhodes remain on morag and wait for peter quill to arrive and lead them to the orb's chamber. they knock quill out and collect the stone, but when the two attempt to travel back, nebula is left behind when her memories are entangled with those of her past self. the thanos of that time uses the link to see into the future, learning that the same humans who had foiled his 2012 invasion are returning to reverse his ultimate victory. determined to know more, thanos captures nebula as she attempts to warn barton and romanoff of his newfound involvement. past nebula confronts her future self and collects her gps device and pym particles, handing it over to her father. meanwhile, barton and romanoff arrive on vormir. they meet red skull, who informs them that the sacrifice of a loved one must be carried out in order for one to retrieve the stone. barton laughs at the concept, but romanoff deduces that it is indeed the truth, as thanos had murdered his daughter gamora there in their time. understanding the severity of the situation, the two struggle to decide who should give their life for the cause; while barton insists he should do it due to the carnage he left behind in the wake of his grief, romanoff declares that her life's work has led her to this moment. as they dash to the cliff, they wrestle to keep each other away from sacrificing themselves. ultimately, romanoff makes the jump and dies, leaving the soul stone with the grief-stricken barton. the avengers return to the present day. reeling from the loss of one of their own, they realize that her death cannot be undone, and that their efforts to save the universe must not leave her death in vain. they construct a new gauntlet using tony's mark suit technology and load the six stones onto it. thor volunteers to perform the snap, but banner steps in, saying he's the only one strong enough to withstand the stones' radiation, which is gamma in nature, similar to his own. while severely scarring his arm, he successfully snaps his fingers and brings the victims of the snap back to life. elsewhere, past nebula - who traveled to the present in place of her future self - opens the avengers' time portal, allowing thanos to bring his ship, the sanctuary ii, forward from 2014. the avengers barely have time to celebrate their success when the ship abruptly opens fire on the compound with a barrage of missiles, reducing the facility to rubble. as thanos sends past nebula to retrieve the stones, her future self reveals to gamora that their relationship in the future became one of friendship and more. gamora decides to join nebula to stop her father. meanwhile, rhodes, rocket and banner are trapped in a flooding area under the rubble, prompting lang to come to their rescue. barton lands next to the gauntlet in the sewer, which is infested with outriders. after escaping them, he unknowingly passes the apparatus to past nebula, who is then confronted by gamora and nebula; the latter kills her past self once she threatens her sister. stark, rogers and thor confront thanos on the ground, who intends to rebuild the entire universe using the stones, a universe where the new living beings will live in peace without knowledge of the past. after stark and thor are overpowered in the ensuing fight, rogers wields mjølnir against the time-displaced titan. however, thanos eventually defeats rogers, severely injuring him and nearly destroys his shield, hacking viciously away at it with his sword. thanos summons the rest of his army, which include the chitauri and the black order, to lay siege on earth. just as rogers prepares to face them alone, he hears sam wilson contacting him through his earpiece. a series of sling ring portals appear behind him. the masters of the mystic arts have arrived with reinforcements from kamar-taj, wakanda, contraxia and new asgard, along with the avengers' resurrected allies from wakanda, titan and san francisco. lang, growing to giant size, retrieves banner, rhodes and rocket from the flooded depths of the destroyed compound. with the scales now balanced, rogers calls for the avengers to assemble and leads his allies into the battle for the fate of the universe. banner tells barton that they must get the stones back to their respective times and away from thanos. with their main time machine destroyed in the initial attack, their only other option is the van; ant-man and wasp jump to hot-wire the dead vehicle. as thanos' forces close in on barton. he passes the gauntlet onto black panther. as thanos prepares to charge at t'challa, he suddenly finds his path blocked by a vengeful wanda maximoff, seeking revenge for his 2018 self's murder of vision. as wanda engages thanos, t'challa runs, only to become entrapped by ebony maw. seeing t'challa's predicament, spider-man swoops in and snatches the gauntlet. meanwhile, wanda's attacks leave thanos at her mercy, as she effortlessly breaks his sword and lifts him into the air while ripping chunks of armor from his body. in order to escape her grasp, thanos orders another missile barrage from sanctuary ii (against corvus glaive's protests) that deals great damage to both sides. one of the missiles takes out a dam, forcing doctor strange out of the fight to prevent the battlefield from flooding. suddenly, sanctuary ii redirects its fire to a target arriving from outer space. it is carol danvers, who comes to single-handedly destroy the warship. retrieving the gauntlet from parker, she enlists the aid of her fellow female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated van. however, thanos uses his sword to destroy the vehicle and the quantum portal. with the gauntlet in thanos' reach, stark, rogers, thor and danvers make their last stand to keep it out of his hands. however, he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and equip the gauntlet. strange signals stark with one shaking finger that this is the one future that ends in their victory. determined, stark dashes at thanos one last time, grappling with the gauntlet on the titan's hand, but he is knocked aside as the titan snaps his fingers. nothing happens, as the stones have been stolen by stark and transferred onto his hand with the suit's nanotech. with the very being that has haunted him for the past eleven years now at his mercy and declaring \"i am ironman!\", stark snaps his own fingers in a large flash of white light. thanos, realizing he's been beaten, watches in horror as his own forces crumble to dust in front of him, only to meet that same fate soon after. stark is mortally wounded from his usage of the stones, and is greeted by rhodes, parker and potts as he lays dying. potts assures her husband that they are going to be alright, and allows him to rest. stark's arc reactor then permanently shuts off, potts giving him one last kiss. rogers and thor mournfully watch at a distance. the mad titan's final defeat and the return of the vanished calls for celebrations all around the world, including in wakanda and san francisco. parker reunites at school with his best friend ned. lang watches the celebration with hope and cassie. at stark's funeral, he leaves a final holographic message for his family and closest friends, including a heartfelt goodbye for morgan. stark's mark i arc reactor is set adrift in the lake outside their cabin, with the avengers and their allies in attendance, including those who had past grievances with stark, such as the pym family, wanda, and bucky barnes. outside new asgard, thor, following his mother's advice, names valkyrie as the new ruler while he abdicates to join the guardians of the galaxy. meanwhile, rogers prepares to go back in time to return the stones and mjølnir, bidding goodbye to barnes. as banner is unable to bring him back when prompted, barnes alerts sam wilson to the presence of an elderly man nearby. it is an aged rogers, who had chosen to remain in the past and live out a full life with peggy carter, a fact he gently refuses to reveal to wilson. he presents wilson with a new shield, passing the mantle of captain america on to him. in the past, peggy and steve dance together in the living room of a suburban house to their song \"it's been a long, long time.\""

    "synopsis": [
      "amid a galactic civil war, rebel alliance is operating from a hidden base and have been securing victories against the evil galactic empire.\nrebel alliance spies have stolen plans to the death star, a colossal, armored space station built by the tyrannical galactic empire that is capable of destroying entire planets.\nimperial senator leia organa (carrie fisher) of alderaan, secretly a rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, and is rushing home to the rebel's secret base. the plans can save the people and restore freedom to the galaxy. leia's ship is intercepted and boarded by an imperial star destroyer under the command of the ruthless darth vader (james earl jones). darth vader can access \"the force\" and inflict intolerable pain on his enemies, without engaging them in battle. due to the mask that he wears, darth vader emits a wheezing noise when he breathes.\nthe empire ships carry the heavily armed stormtroopers, which make up the bulk of the empire army.\nleia is taken prisoner, but before the capture, leia inserts the plans in her droid r2-d2, along with a message. the droids r2-d2 (kenny baker) and c-3po (anthony daniels) escape with the plans on an escape pod, crashing on the nearby planet of tatooine.\ndarth vader sends his stormtroopers after them to retrieve the plans. the droids are captured by jawa traders who electrocute r2-d2, and sell them to moisture farmers owen (phil brown) and beru lars (shelagh fraser) and their nephew, luke skywalker (mark hamill). owen needed droids who understand the binary language of moisture vaporators. while c3po is a protocol droid, he is trained in the language of load filters, similar to vaporators. he can also speak bocce. c3po convinces luke to take r2-d2 as well. owen asks luke to clean up both droids before dinner.\nwhile luke is cleaning r2-d2, he discovers a recording of leia requesting help from a former ally named obi-wan kenobi (alec guinness). luke is interested in the rebellion and wants to learn more about it. r2-d2 says that the message is a private one for obi-wan and that r2-d2 is his property. obi-wan lives on tatooine. luke knows of a ben kenobi, an old hermit, who lives beyond the dune sea.\nluke - who hopes to leave home for training at a nearby imperial military academy to become a space pilot - leaves the room angrily to return to cleaning the droids. luke's aunt beru tells owen that luke is too much like his father to remain with them, but owen holds out hope that luke's desire for adventure will subside - and expresses a fear that luke is too much like his father... suggesting that owen may know something of anakin's terrible past.\nmeanwhile, the stormtroopers land on tatooine and follow the tracks made by the jawa trader's ship. r2-d2 goes missing. luke tells 3po that it's too late to look for r2 because of the dangerous sand people (also called tusken raiders) in the area, and that they will set out first thing in the morning to go look for him.\nluke and c3po go on luke's landspeeder to look for r2-d2 and catch up with it. r2-d2 is adamant that it needs to get to obi-wan. luke is attacked by sand people. he is rescued by obi-wan, an elderly hermit. luke addresses him as ben, and says that the droid has been looking for obi-wan. ben says that he is obi-wan but hasn't been addressed as that in a long time. obi-wan tells luke about his past as one of the jedi knights, former peacekeepers of the galactic republic (for over a thousand generations), who drew mystical abilities from \"the force\" but were hunted to near-extinction by the empire. obi-wan explains that a jedi receives his power from the force, an energy field that is created by all living beings that \"surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together.\" but there is also a dark side to the force, which draws power from negative emotions and baser impulses.\nluke learns that his father, also a jedi, fought alongside obi-wan during the clone wars until vader, obi-wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the force and murdered him. then he became the dark lord of the sith, the most feared enforcer of the emperor. in this capacity, he proceeded to hunt down his former comrades, and the jedi order is now all but extinct. luke had been told by his uncle that his father anakin was a navigator on a spice freighter.\nobi-wan offers luke his father's old light-saber (an energy sword), the signature weapon of the jedi. r2-d2 plays leia's full message, in which she begs obi-wan to take the death star plans to alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. luke initially declines obi-wan's offer to accompany him to alderaan and learn the ways of the force, but he is left with no choice after imperial stormtroopers murder his family while searching for the droids. seeking a way off the planet, luke and obi-wan travel to the spaceport of mos eisley. obi-wan uses the force to hypnotize the imperial stormtroopers and provide safe passage through the city. they reach a tavern which is frequented by several space freighter pilots, who would be willing to transport anything for the right fee. obi-wan makes contact with a wookie named chewbacca. they hire han solo (harrison ford) (for 10,000 credits), a smuggler indebted to local mobster jabba the hutt, for a passage to alderaan. luke knows that for that kind of money, they can buy their own ship. han claims that his ship the millenium falcon made the kessel run in 12 parsecs and can outrun imperial star-ships. obi-wan offers to pay 2000 credits upfront and 15,000 credits upon arrival. they agree to meet in bay 94.\nhan hangs back to take care of their bar tab and is stopped by greedo (paul blake), a bounty hunter working for feared crime lord jabba desilijic tiure, aka: jabba the hutt. apparently, jabba had hired han to transport a shipment of glitterstim spice (an illegal narcotic), but han had to dump the shipment due to an unexpected imperial boarding. as greedo points a blaster pistol at solo, han insists that he has the 8,000 credits he needs to cover the loss. greedo suggests that solo give it to him as a bribe not to turn him over to jabba, forcing han to admit that he doesn't actually have the money yet. solo quietly removes his heavy pistol under the table, and pre-emptively fires and kills him. on his way out, han throws the bartender a few coins, apologizing for \"the mess\" he left. at the docking bay, han is confronted by jabba the hutt. jabba expresses frustration over greedo's death and reminds han that he cannot spare who fail or cross him, lest he appear weak. han insists that he will soon have enough money to pay off his debt, with interest of 15%, he just needs more time. jabba reluctantly agrees but warns han that this is his last chance. luke sells his landspeeder to raise money for their initial payment to captain solo. they head to the docking bay. luke is worried to discover that the falcon is a 60-year-old, run-down yt-1300 freighter, but han assures him that he has made extensive modifications to ensure that she can run rings around any modern capital ship.\npursued by stormtroopers (who were informed by local spies about the location of the droids), luke, obi-wan, r2-d2, and c-3po flee tatooine with han and his wookiee copilot, chewbacca (peter mayhew), on their ship, the millennium falcon. they are pursued by an imperial cruiser, but han manages to jump to light speed before they can be caught. a jump through hyper-space is dangerous as with the wrong calculations one could travel through a star or a supernova and end up dead. meanwhile, aboard the death star, commander grand moff tarkin tells his commanders that the emperor has dissolved the imperial senate permanently, and with that all remnants of the old republic. regional governors now have direct control over their territories. the empire plans to use the death star to breed fear in the galaxy but are afraid that the rebels might find a weakness in its defenses and exploit it. darth vader is given the task to locate the rebel fortress before the death star is operational.\ndarth vader starts to interrogate leia regarding the location of the rebel base. leia resists the mind probe and gives nothing to darth vader. as the death star becomes operational, moff turns it towards alderaan, where leia was headed in her diplomatic ship in the first place. before the falcon reaches alderaan, the death star commander grand moff tarkin (peter cushing) has the planet obliterated by the station's gigantic laser. moff wants to demonstrate the power of the death star on leia's home planet, even though she begs that alderaan is peaceful and has no weapons. moff would have spared the planet, if leia reveals the name of the rebel base. leia names dantooine, but moff destroys alderaan regardless as dantoonie is too far away to make an effective demonstration. obi-wan senses a disturbance in the force, the moment alderaan is destroyed. on their way, obi-wan starts training luke on the use of the lightsaber. han does not believe in the force. obi-wan demonstrates the existence of the force when luke is able to defeat a training bot with all his senses blocked, but by plugging into the force. upon arrival, the falcon is captured by the death star's (which is the size of a small moon) tractor beam. the ship is identified as the same as the one that escaped the mos eisley and darth vader believes that they were bringing the plans of the death star to alderaan. the group escapes inside the death star (by hiding under the floorboards of the ship and making it look like they jettisoned from the ship using the escape pods) and infiltrates the station. r2-d2 hacks into the computer systems and figures out the schematics of the death star.\nas obi-wan leaves to disable the tractor beam, r2-d2 locates leia on the ship. luke persuades han and chewbacca to help him rescue leia, who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the rebel base. luke says that leia is the one in the message and so must be someone important. han is only convinced when luke says that leia is a princess and is likely to be rich and will rewards han handsomely.\nhan and luke disguise as stormtroopers with chewie as their prisoner, as they get to leia's location. vader can sense a presence on the death star, that he has not felt since the presence of his previous master. he reports to moff that obi-wan is on the death star, which moff cannot believe as the jedi are extinct. darth vader follows the force and finds obi-wan on the death star.\nafter disabling the tractor beam, obi-wan sacrifices himself in a light-saber duel against vader. obi-wan vanishes into thin air, before darth vader's light-saber hits him. luke and han reach leia's floor and rescue her from her cell, after dispatching the security. leia comes along when she hears obi-wan is with the group. as reinforcements arrive, the group is forced to take a different route back through the garbage chute. but they drop into a garbage masher which starts to close in. c3po manages to pick up a communications unit when stormtroopers come into the control room, but do not recognize them as the escapee droids.\nusing the communications unit, c3po gets in contact with luke and with r2-d2 in the control room, they disable the garbage masher. eventually, the 2 groups reach the hangar where the falcon is being kept, after fighting more stormtroopers.\nobi-wan's sacrifice allows the rest of the group to escape the death star (when a voice from the sky instructs luke to escape). the falcon fights off the tie fighters sent after them.\nusing a tracking device on the falcon, the empire locates the rebel base on the 4th moon around planet yavin. leia informs han that r2-d2 is carrying the technical specifications of death star. for a moment it looks like both luke and han are interested in leia. analysis of the captured death star schematics reveals a hidden weakness in a small exhaust port (2 meters wide) leading directly to the station's reactor. a precise hit will start a chain reaction that will destroy the station. after collecting his reward for rescuing leia, han leaves the rebels to pay off jabba. the rebels plan their attack on the death star, as they detect its approach towards their moon. luke joins the rebels' x-wing squadron of 30 ships (with r2-d2 installed on his own x-wing fighter) in a desperate attack against the approaching death star which will be within range in 15 minutes. in the ensuing battle, vader leads a squadron of tie fighters against the rebels, and they suffer heavy losses. vader personally thwarts several rebel attempts to hit the exhaust port with photon torpedoes. luke is on the last run, before the death star will be in range of the rebel base. han and chewbacca unexpectedly return to aid them in the falcon, knocking vader's ship off course before he can shoot luke down. guided by the voice of obi-wan's spirit, luke uses the force (and switches off his on-board computer) to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, causing the death star to explode moments before it can fire on the rebel base. obi-wan's spirit reminds luke that the force will always be with him.\nin a triumphant ceremony, leia awards luke and han medals for their heroism."

      "plot_summary": "During a galactic civil war, Rebel spies steal schematics for the Empire's Death Star, a planet-destroying battle station. Princess Leia Organa (Alderaan native and Rebel leader) hides the plans inside astromech droid R2-D2 and sends him with protocol droid C-3PO in an escape pod. Their ship is captured by an Imperial Star Destroyer commanded by Darth Vader; Leia is taken prisoner. The droids escape and crash on Tatooine, where Jawas capture them and sell them to moisture farmer Owen Lars and his wife Beru. Their nephew Luke Skywalker finds R2-D2, discovers Leia's recorded plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and seeks out Ben Kenobi—who reveals he is Obi-Wan Kenobi, a former Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan tells Luke about the Force and Luke's father, gives Luke his father's lightsaber, and urges him to take Leia's message to the Rebel base.\n\nImperial stormtroopers track the droids to the Lars homestead; the troopers kill Owen and Beru while searching for the droids. With his family dead, Luke abandons plans to join the Imperial academy and joins Obi-Wan. They travel to Mos Eisley spaceport to hire transport to Alderaan. They hire smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca aboard the Millennium Falcon for 10,000 credits (2,000 up front). Han kills bounty hunter Greedo in the cantina when confronted over a debt to Jabba the Hutt. Luke sells his landspeeder to raise the down payment.\n\nPursued by Imperial ships, the Falcon jumps to hyperspace but is pulled out by the Death Star's tractor beam. Grand Moff Tarkin demonstrates the Death Star's power by destroying Leia's homeworld Alderaan when Leia refuses to reveal the Rebel base. The Falcon is captured and brought aboard the Death Star; Obi-Wan disables the tractor beam to let them escape. Luke, Han, and Chewbacca rescue Leia from her detention cell after disguising Han and Luke as stormtroopers and posing Chewbacca as a prisoner. Obi-Wan goes off alone to disable the tractor beam's systems. Darth Vader confronts Obi-Wan; they duel. Obi-Wan sacrifices himself—allowing Vader's lightsaber to strike and Obi-Wan to vanish—distracting Vader so the rest can escape.\n\nThe group flees the Death Star in the Falcon with R2-D2 having transmitted the stolen schematics to the Rebels. Imperial forces use a homing beacon planted on the Falcon to locate the Rebel base at Yavin 4. Tactical analysis reveals a two-meter thermal exhaust port leading to the Death Star's reactor; a precise proton torpedo shot will trigger a chain reaction to destroy the station. The Rebels mount a desperate space assault with X-wings and other fighters. Darth Vader leads a fighter squadron and shoots down many attackers. Luke flies an X-wing with R2-D2 aboard; Han, who had left to pay Jabba, returns in the Falcon with Chewbacca and shoots down Vader's wingman, saving Luke. Guided by Obi-Wan's voice and trusting the Force, Luke switches off his targeting computer and fires torpedoes into the exhaust port; the Death Star explodes before it can fire on the Rebel base. In the aftermath, the Rebels hold a medal ceremony on Yavin 4 where Princess Leia awards Luke Skywalker and Han Solo medals for their roles in the victory.",

      "amid a galactic civil war, rebel alliance is operating from a hidden base and have been securing victories against the evil galactic empire.\nrebel alliance spies have stolen plans to the death star, a colossal, armored space station built by the tyrannical galactic empire that is capable of destroying entire planets.\nimperial senator leia organa (carrie fisher) of alderaan, secretly a rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, and is rushing home to the rebel's secret base. the plans can save the people and restore freedom to the galaxy. leia's ship is intercepted and boarded by an imperial star destroyer under the command of the ruthless darth vader (james earl jones). darth vader can access \"the force\" and inflict intolerable pain on his enemies, without engaging them in battle. due to the mask that he wears, darth vader emits a wheezing noise when he breathes.\nthe empire ships carry the heavily armed stormtroopers, which make up the bulk of the empire army.\nleia is taken prisoner, but before the capture, leia inserts the plans in her droid r2-d2, along with a message. the droids r2-d2 (kenny baker) and c-3po (anthony daniels) escape with the plans on an escape pod, crashing on the nearby planet of tatooine.\ndarth vader sends his stormtroopers after them to retrieve the plans. the droids are captured by jawa traders who electrocute r2-d2, and sell them to moisture farmers owen (phil brown) and beru lars (shelagh fraser) and their nephew, luke skywalker (mark hamill). owen needed droids who understand the binary language of moisture vaporators. while c3po is a protocol droid, he is trained in the language of load filters, similar to vaporators. he can also speak bocce. c3po convinces luke to take r2-d2 as well. owen asks luke to clean up both droids before dinner.\nwhile luke is cleaning r2-d2, he discovers a recording of leia requesting help from a former ally named obi-wan kenobi (alec guinness). luke is interested in the rebellion and wants to learn more about it. r2-d2 says that the message is a private one for obi-wan and that r2-d2 is his property. obi-wan lives on tatooine. luke knows of a ben kenobi, an old hermit, who lives beyond the dune sea.\nluke - who hopes to leave home for training at a nearby imperial military academy to become a space pilot - leaves the room angrily to return to cleaning the droids. luke's aunt beru tells owen that luke is too much like his father to remain with them, but owen holds out hope that luke's desire for adventure will subside - and expresses a fear that luke is too much like his father... suggesting that owen may know something of anakin's terrible past.\nmeanwhile, the stormtroopers land on tatooine and follow the tracks made by the jawa trader's ship. r2-d2 goes missing. luke tells 3po that it's too late to look for r2 because of the dangerous sand people (also called tusken raiders) in the area, and that they will set out first thing in the morning to go look for him.\nluke and c3po go on luke's landspeeder to look for r2-d2 and catch up with it. r2-d2 is adamant that it needs to get to obi-wan. luke is attacked by sand people. he is rescued by obi-wan, an elderly hermit. luke addresses him as ben, and says that the droid has been looking for obi-wan. ben says that he is obi-wan but hasn't been addressed as that in a long time. obi-wan tells luke about his past as one of the jedi knights, former peacekeepers of the galactic republic (for over a thousand generations), who drew mystical abilities from \"the force\" but were hunted to near-extinction by the empire. obi-wan explains that a jedi receives his power from the force, an energy field that is created by all living beings that \"surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together.\" but there is also a dark side to the force, which draws power from negative emotions and baser impulses.\nluke learns that his father, also a jedi, fought alongside obi-wan during the clone wars until vader, obi-wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the force and murdered him. then he became the dark lord of the sith, the most feared enforcer of the emperor. in this capacity, he proceeded to hunt down his former comrades, and the jedi order is now all but extinct. luke had been told by his uncle that his father anakin was a navigator on a spice freighter.\nobi-wan offers luke his father's old light-saber (an energy sword), the signature weapon of the jedi. r2-d2 plays leia's full message, in which she begs obi-wan to take the death star plans to alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. luke initially declines obi-wan's offer to accompany him to alderaan and learn the ways of the force, but he is left with no choice after imperial stormtroopers murder his family while searching for the droids. seeking a way off the planet, luke and obi-wan travel to the spaceport of mos eisley. obi-wan uses the force to hypnotize the imperial stormtroopers and provide safe passage through the city. they reach a tavern which is frequented by several space freighter pilots, who would be willing to transport anything for the right fee. obi-wan makes contact with a wookie named chewbacca. they hire han solo (harrison ford) (for 10,000 credits), a smuggler indebted to local mobster jabba the hutt, for a passage to alderaan. luke knows that for that kind of money, they can buy their own ship. han claims that his ship the millenium falcon made the kessel run in 12 parsecs and can outrun imperial star-ships. obi-wan offers to pay 2000 credits upfront and 15,000 credits upon arrival. they agree to meet in bay 94.\nhan hangs back to take care of their bar tab and is stopped by greedo (paul blake), a bounty hunter working for feared crime lord jabba desilijic tiure, aka: jabba the hutt. apparently, jabba had hired han to transport a shipment of glitterstim spice (an illegal narcotic), but han had to dump the shipment due to an unexpected imperial boarding. as greedo points a blaster pistol at solo, han insists that he has the 8,000 credits he needs to cover the loss. greedo suggests that solo give it to him as a bribe not to turn him over to jabba, forcing han to admit that he doesn't actually have the money yet. solo quietly removes his heavy pistol under the table, and pre-emptively fires and kills him. on his way out, han throws the bartender a few coins, apologizing for \"the mess\" he left. at the docking bay, han is confronted by jabba the hutt. jabba expresses frustration over greedo's death and reminds han that he cannot spare who fail or cross him, lest he appear weak. han insists that he will soon have enough money to pay off his debt, with interest of 15%, he just needs more time. jabba reluctantly agrees but warns han that this is his last chance. luke sells his landspeeder to raise money for their initial payment to captain solo. they head to the docking bay. luke is worried to discover that the falcon is a 60-year-old, run-down yt-1300 freighter, but han assures him that he has made extensive modifications to ensure that she can run rings around any modern capital ship.\npursued by stormtroopers (who were informed by local spies about the location of the droids), luke, obi-wan, r2-d2, and c-3po flee tatooine with han and his wookiee copilot, chewbacca (peter mayhew), on their ship, the millennium falcon. they are pursued by an imperial cruiser, but han manages to jump to light speed before they can be caught. a jump through hyper-space is dangerous as with the wrong calculations one could travel through a star or a supernova and end up dead. meanwhile, aboard the death star, commander grand moff tarkin tells his commanders that the emperor has dissolved the imperial senate permanently, and with that all remnants of the old republic. regional governors now have direct control over their territories. the empire plans to use the death star to breed fear in the galaxy but are afraid that the rebels might find a weakness in its defenses and exploit it. darth vader is given the task to locate the rebel fortress before the death star is operational.\ndarth vader starts to interrogate leia regarding the location of the rebel base. leia resists the mind probe and gives nothing to darth vader. as the death star becomes operational, moff turns it towards alderaan, where leia was headed in her diplomatic ship in the first place. before the falcon reaches alderaan, the death star commander grand moff tarkin (peter cushing) has the planet obliterated by the station's gigantic laser. moff wants to demonstrate the power of the death star on leia's home planet, even though she begs that alderaan is peaceful and has no weapons. moff would have spared the planet, if leia reveals the name of the rebel base. leia names dantooine, but moff destroys alderaan regardless as dantoonie is too far away to make an effective demonstration. obi-wan senses a disturbance in the force, the moment alderaan is destroyed. on their way, obi-wan starts training luke on the use of the lightsaber. han does not believe in the force. obi-wan demonstrates the existence of the force when luke is able to defeat a training bot with all his senses blocked, but by plugging into the force. upon arrival, the falcon is captured by the death star's (which is the size of a small moon) tractor beam. the ship is identified as the same as the one that escaped the mos eisley and darth vader believes that they were bringing the plans of the death star to alderaan. the group escapes inside the death star (by hiding under the floorboards of the ship and making it look like they jettisoned from the ship using the escape pods) and infiltrates the station. r2-d2 hacks into the computer systems and figures out the schematics of the death star.\nas obi-wan leaves to disable the tractor beam, r2-d2 locates leia on the ship. luke persuades han and chewbacca to help him rescue leia, who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the rebel base. luke says that leia is the one in the message and so must be someone important. han is only convinced when luke says that leia is a princess and is likely to be rich and will rewards han handsomely.\nhan and luke disguise as stormtroopers with chewie as their prisoner, as they get to leia's location. vader can sense a presence on the death star, that he has not felt since the presence of his previous master. he reports to moff that obi-wan is on the death star, which moff cannot believe as the jedi are extinct. darth vader follows the force and finds obi-wan on the death star.\nafter disabling the tractor beam, obi-wan sacrifices himself in a light-saber duel against vader. obi-wan vanishes into thin air, before darth vader's light-saber hits him. luke and han reach leia's floor and rescue her from her cell, after dispatching the security. leia comes along when she hears obi-wan is with the group. as reinforcements arrive, the group is forced to take a different route back through the garbage chute. but they drop into a garbage masher which starts to close in. c3po manages to pick up a communications unit when stormtroopers come into the control room, but do not recognize them as the escapee droids.\nusing the communications unit, c3po gets in contact with luke and with r2-d2 in the control room, they disable the garbage masher. eventually, the 2 groups reach the hangar where the falcon is being kept, after fighting more stormtroopers.\nobi-wan's sacrifice allows the rest of the group to escape the death star (when a voice from the sky instructs luke to escape). the falcon fights off the tie fighters sent after them.\nusing a tracking device on the falcon, the empire locates the rebel base on the 4th moon around planet yavin. leia informs han that r2-d2 is carrying the technical specifications of death star. for a moment it looks like both luke and han are interested in leia. analysis of the captured death star schematics reveals a hidden weakness in a small exhaust port (2 meters wide) leading directly to the station's reactor. a precise hit will start a chain reaction that will destroy the station. after collecting his reward for rescuing leia, han leaves the rebels to pay off jabba. the rebels plan their attack on the death star, as they detect its approach towards their moon. luke joins the rebels' x-wing squadron of 30 ships (with r2-d2 installed on his own x-wing fighter) in a desperate attack against the approaching death star which will be within range in 15 minutes. in the ensuing battle, vader leads a squadron of tie fighters against the rebels, and they suffer heavy losses. vader personally thwarts several rebel attempts to hit the exhaust port with photon torpedoes. luke is on the last run, before the death star will be in range of the rebel base. han and chewbacca unexpectedly return to aid them in the falcon, knocking vader's ship off course before he can shoot luke down. guided by the voice of obi-wan's spirit, luke uses the force (and switches off his on-board computer) to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, causing the death star to explode moments before it can fire on the rebel base. obi-wan's spirit reminds luke that the force will always be with him.\nin a triumphant ceremony, leia awards luke and han medals for their heroism."

    "synopsis": [
      "lord voldemort, an evil and powerful dark wizard, has just been defeated. when he tried to kill a 1 year-old boy, harry potter (daniel radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, voldemort having killed his parents, lily and james potter. professors dumbledore (richard harris) and mcgonagall (dame maggie smith) and gamekeeper hagrid (robbie coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent muggle (non-magical) relatives, the dursley family, who take him in. harry's relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years. shortly before harry's 11th birthday, he receives a letter. his outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it. the sender does not give up, and the dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. soon, his uncle vernon (richard griffiths), with harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. that night (which happens to be before harry's birthday), he is visited by hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. with hagrid holding the dursleys at bay, harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. the next day harry and hagrid head to diagon alley in london (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous wizarding pub the leaky cauldron). harry enters the wizarding world for the first time, learns to his surprise that he is famous, and meets the new hogwarts defense against the dark arts teacher, professor quirrell (ian hart). he takes the train to hogwarts from platform nine and three-quarters, befriending ron weasley (rupert grint), and meeting hermione granger (emma watson), a muggle-born witch. upon arrival, the sorting hat places harry, ron and hermione in gryffindor house. draco malfoy (tom felton), an arrogant and elitist student, gets placed in slytherin. at the end of their first week at hogwarts, harry and ron discover that gringotts, the wizarding bank, was broken into and a vault that harry and hagrid visited had been the subject of the robbery. later, harry discovers he has a talent for riding broomsticks, and is recruited to join gryffindor's quidditch team as a seeker, much to malfoy's displeasure. harry, ron, hermione explore hogwarts late at night and accidentally stumble across the door to a corridor. a three-headed dog, christened fluffy by hagrid, guards a trapdoor. on halloween, quirrell informs everyone that a troll has entered the castle; harry and ron fight the troll to save hermione, who is trapped in the girls' bathroom, and the three become best friends.\nat harry's first quidditch match, harry's broom becomes possessed, nearly knocking him off. hermione sees professor severus snape (alan rickman), the sinister potions master and head of slytherin house, staring at harry and mouthing words, making her believe that snape has caused the broom to misbehave with a dark curse. hoping to save harry, hermione sets snape's robes on fire, distracting him and others and allowing harry to survive. at christmas, harry receives an invisibility cloak, once belonging to his father, which renders its wearer invisible. harry uses it to explore the restricted section in the library to research information on nicolas flamel, a name hagrid lets slip when confronted about his knowledge of fluffy. eventually, harry learns that \"nicolas flamel is the only known maker of the sorcerer's stone, which produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal.\" harry sees snape trying to get information from quirrell about getting past fluffy; quirrell says he does not know what he's talking about. harry, ron, and hermione are sure that snape is trying to steal the philosopher's stone in order to restore lord voldemort to power. while at hagrid's hut, the trio discover a dragon egg hagrid was nursing in a fire. later the egg hatches a norwegian ridgeback dragon, and hagrid decides to call him \"norbert\". the friends are nervous for hagrid, since dragon breeding had long been outlawed in the wizarding world, and hagrid had something of a reckless nature, who has long since nursed a strong desire for a dragon. finally, harry, ron, and hermione are able to convince hagrid to let norbert go live with other dragons of his kind in romania. harry, hermione, ron and draco are caught out late at night, and are forced to serve detention with hagrid in the forbidden forest. harry sees a hooded figure drink the blood of an injured unicorn, which makes harry's forehead scar start burning. firenze, a centaur, tells harry that it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn, let alone drink its blood. he also tells harry that unicorn blood will keep one alive, and that the hooded figure is in fact voldemort. harry, hermione and ron find out that hagrid has told a hooded stranger how to get past fluffy, and they believe the theft of the stone is imminent. rushing to finally confide in professor dumbledore their news, they meet professor mcgonagall, who is shocked to find out how much they knew about the stone but reassures them all the same that it is safe in the castle. she also tells them that dumbledore has been sent away on an important mission by the ministry of magic. positive that dumbledore's summons was a red herring to take professor dumbledore away from hogwarts, the trio make plans to thwart snape's theft of the stone. they set out to reach the stone first, navigating the security system set up by the school's staff, which is a series of complex magical challenges. the three make it through together until finally, harry must enter the inner chamber alone. there he finds that professor quirrell, not snape, is attempting to steal the stone. realizing that snape was trying to protect him from harm all along, harry confronts quirrell and survives a second encounter with lord voldemort, who has possessed quirrell and appears as a ghastly face on the back of quirrell's head. quirrell crumbles when he touches harry's skin, and harry passes out because of his close proximity to lord voldemort. voldemort then pitilessly abandons quirrell, who dies in the aftermath of his possession. harry wakes up in the hospital wing. dumbledore reveals to harry that harry's mother died to protect harry as an infant. her pure, loving sacrifice provides harry with an ancient magical protection from voldemort's lethal spells and also prevents voldemort from touching harry without suffering terribly. dumbledore also says that the sorcerer's stone has been destroyed to prevent future attempts by voldemort to steal it. finally, at the end-of-year feast, the house points totals are given: gryffindor is in last place. however, dumbledore gives a few \"last-minute additions\", granting points to harry, ron, and hermione, so that gryffindor wins the house cup."

      "plot_summary": "As the film opens, Lord Voldemort has been driven from physical form after attempting to kill infant Harry Potter; Lily and James Potter are dead and baby Harry, with a lightning-bolt scar, is left on the Dursley doorstep by Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid. Harry spends ten years living neglected with his aunt Petunia, uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley, hidden in a cupboard under the stairs. In the weeks before his eleventh birthday Harry begins receiving letters; Vernon tries to stop delivery by moving the family to a remote island hut. Rubeus Hagrid bursts in on that night, delivers Harry's Hogwarts acceptance letter, and takes him the next day to Diagon Alley where Harry learns he is famous in the wizarding world, buys school supplies and meets Professor Quirrell. At King's Cross station Harry boards the Hogwarts Express from Platform 9 3/4 and befriends Ron Weasley; he also meets Hermione Granger and the arrogant Draco Malfoy. At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry the Sorting Hat places Harry, Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor. Harry is recruited as Gryffindor's Seeker after demonstrating flying skill on a broom. Hagrid reveals he keeps a three-headed dog, Fluffy, guarding a trapdoor; later Dumbledore's absenting on Ministry business and Hagrid's slip of the name \"Nicolas Flamel\" lead the trio to suspect a hidden treasure — the Philosopher's (Sorcerer's) Stone — is concealed at Hogwarts. Harry endures a Quidditch match where his broom is jinxed and Hermione briefly thinks Severus Snape cursed it after seeing Snape stare; she distracts Snape by setting his robes alight. At Halloween the friends fight a mountain troll in the girl's bathroom and cement their friendship. Over the term, the trio use Harry's invisibility cloak (a Christmas gift that once belonged to Harry's father) to investigate restricted areas and the library; they discover Flamel is the maker of the Stone, which grants immortality via the Elixir of Life. They learn a vault at Gringotts was broken into earlier and suspect someone at Hogwarts — initially Snape — is trying to steal the Stone to restore Voldemort. On a detention in the Forbidden Forest Harry witnesses a hooded figure (later revealed as Voldemort) drinking unicorn blood; his scar burns. The trio deduce Hagrid once told a stranger how to get past Fluffy and fear an imminent theft. With Dumbledore away, Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to reach the Stone first. They bypass a sequence of magical protections — Devil's Snare, a room of flying keys, a life-sized wizard's chess game (Ron sacrifices himself to win), a logic puzzle with potions (Hermione solves it) — and reach the final chamber. Harry enters alone and finds Professor Quirrell there, not Snape. Quirrell reveals he is hosting Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head; Voldemort has been manipulating events to reclaim the Stone. Voldemort/Quirrell attempts to seize the Stone, but Harry's mother's sacrificial protection makes Quirrell unable to touch him; Quirrell's skin blisters and he dies after being abandoned by Voldemort. Harry faints and awakens in the hospital wing where Dumbledore explains that Lily Potter's sacrificial love protected Harry and that Nicholas Flamel's Stone has been destroyed to prevent misuse. Dumbledore also reveals Snape's apparent hostility masked efforts to protect Harry. At the end-of-year feast Dumbledore awards last-minute points to Harry, Ron and Hermione so Gryffindor wins the House Cup.",

      "harry potter (daniel radcliffe) thinks he is an ordinary boy celebrating his eleventh birthday, but he is far from right. a giant named hagrid (robbie coltrane) appears, and gives harry the all-important news. he is a wizard. now his journey in life gets more intense as he travels to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn the trade of being a wizard. here, he meets his friends who would be by his side for many years to come. ron weasley (rupert grint) is not a very brave friend and hermione (emma watson) is the smart friend. but not everything is quiet at hogwarts as harry suspects someone is planning to steal the philosopher's/sorcerer's stone.",
      "on his eleventh birthday, harry potter (daniel radcliffe) discovers that he is no ordinary boy. hagrid (robbie coltrane), a beetle-eyed giant, tells harry that he is a wizard and has a place at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. in his first year of magical education, harry tackles a fully grown mountain troll, learns to play quidditch, and participates in a thrilling \"live\" game of chess."

    "synopsis": [
      "galadriel (cate blanchett) (the elven co-ruler of lothlorien alongside her husband celeborn (marton csokas)), shows the dark lord sauron forging the one ring which he can use to conquer the lands of middle-earth through his enslavement of the bearers of the rings of power: powerful magical rings given to individuals from the races of elves, dwarves and men.\na last alliance of elves and men is formed to counter sauron and his forces at the foot of mount doom, but sauron himself appears to kill elendil (peter mckenzie), the high king of arnor and gondor, and gil-galad (mark ferguson), high king of the noldor. just afterward, elendil's son isildur (harry sinclair) grabs his father's broken sword narsil, and slashes at sauron's hand. the stroke cuts off sauron's fingers, separating him from the ring and vanquishing his army. however, because sauron's life is bound in the ring, he is not completely defeated until the ring itself is destroyed. isildur takes the ring and succumbs to its temptation, refusing to destroy it, but he is later ambushed and killed by orcs and the ring is lost in the river into which isildur fell. the ring is found 2500 years later, and eventually it comes to the creature gollum (andy serkis) (a wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the ring after bearing it for 500 years), who takes it underground for five centuries, giving gollum \"unnaturally long life.\"\nthe ring leaves him however, and is found by the hobbit bilbo baggins (ian holm), much to the grief of gollum. bilbo returns to his home in the shire with the ring, and the story jumps forward in time sixty years.\nat his 111th birthday, bilbo leaves the ring to his nephew and adopted heir frodo baggins (elijah wood). the wizard gandalf (ian mckellen) investigates the ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that gollum was captured and brutally tortured by sauron's orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"shire\" and \"baggins.\"\ngandalf returns and warns frodo to leave the shire. frodo departs with his friend, gardener sam (sean astin) to bree, with plans to meet him there after gandalf goes to isengard to meet the head of his order, saruman (christopher lee). saruman reveals that the nazgul, or ringwraiths, have left mordor to capture the ring and kill whoever carries it; having already turned to sauron's cause, he then imprisons gandalf atop orthanc. frodo and sam are soon joined by fellow hobbits merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd). after encountering a ringwraith on the road, they manage to reach bree, and there they meet a man called strider (viggo mortensen), who agrees to lead them to rivendell. they agree only because gandalf isn't there to guide them. after some travelling, they spend the night on the hill of weathertop, where they are attacked by the nazgul at night. strider fights off the ringwraiths, but frodo is grievously wounded with a morgul blade, and they must quickly get him to rivendell for healing. while chased by the nazgul, frodo is taken by the elf arwen (liv tyler) (also strider's beloved) to the elvish haven of rivendell, and healed by her father, elrond (hugo weaving). in rivendell frodo meets gandalf, who explains why he didn't meet them at bree as planned. in the meantime, there are many meetings between various peoples, and elrond calls a council to decide what should be done with the ring. the ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires (that is, lava) of mount doom, where it was forged. mount doom is located in mordor, near sauron's fortress of barad-dur, and will be an incredibly dangerous journey. frodo volunteers to take the ring to mount doom as all the others argue about who should or shouldn't take it. he is accompanied by his hobbit friends and gandalf, as well as strider, who is revealed to be aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of gondor. bilbo, now living in rivendell, gives frodo his sword sting, and a chain-mail shirt made of mithril. also travelling with them are the elf legolas (orlando bloom), the dwarf gimli (john rhys-davies) and boromir (sean bean), the son of the steward of gondor. together they comprise the fellowship of the ring. the fellowship set out and try to pass the mountain caradhras, but they are stopped by saruman's wizardry. they are forced to travel under the mountain through the mines of moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end.\nafter journeying partway through the mines, pippin accidentally gives away their presence to a band of orcs. the fellowship then encounter a balrog (durin's bane is a balrog residing within the mines), an ancient demon of fire and shadow, at the bridge of khazad-dum. while the others escape, gandalf fends off the balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the balrog drags gandalf down into the darkness with him. the group flees to the elvish realm of lothlorien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, galadriel and her husband celeborn. galadriel privately informs frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the fellowship will try to take the ring. she also shows him a vision of the future in which sauron succeeds in enslaving middle-earth, including the shire.\nmeanwhile, saruman creates an army of uruk-hai in isengard to find and kill the fellowship.\nafter resting, they decide to travel on the river anduin towards parth galen. before they leave, galadriel gives frodo the phial of galadriel. after landing at parth galen, boromir tries to take the ring from frodo, who manages to escape by putting the ring on his finger and vanishing. knowing that the ring's temptation will be too strong for the fellowship, frodo decides to leave them and go to mordor alone. meanwhile, the rest of the fellowship are attacked by uruk-hai. merry and pippin, realizing that frodo is leaving, distract the orcs, allowing frodo to escape. boromir rushes to the aid of the two hobbits but is mortally wounded by the orc commander lurtz, and merry and pippin are captured.\naragorn, legolas, and gimli find boromir, who regrets attempting to steal the ring and dies. fearing the ring will corrupt his friends, frodo decides to travel to mordor alone, but allows sam to come along, recalling his promise to gandalf to look after him. as aragorn, legolas, and gimli set out to rescue merry and pippin, frodo and sam make their way down the pass of emyn muil, journeying on to mordor."

      "galadriel (cate blanchett) (the elven co-ruler of lothlorien alongside her husband celeborn (marton csokas)), shows the dark lord sauron forging the one ring which he can use to conquer the lands of middle-earth through his enslavement of the bearers of the rings of power: powerful magical rings given to individuals from the races of elves, dwarves and men.\na last alliance of elves and men is formed to counter sauron and his forces at the foot of mount doom, but sauron himself appears to kill elendil (peter mckenzie), the high king of arnor and gondor, and gil-galad (mark ferguson), high king of the noldor. just afterward, elendil's son isildur (harry sinclair) grabs his father's broken sword narsil, and slashes at sauron's hand. the stroke cuts off sauron's fingers, separating him from the ring and vanquishing his army. however, because sauron's life is bound in the ring, he is not completely defeated until the ring itself is destroyed. isildur takes the ring and succumbs to its temptation, refusing to destroy it, but he is later ambushed and killed by orcs and the ring is lost in the river into which isildur fell. the ring is found 2500 years later, and eventually it comes to the creature gollum (andy serkis) (a wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the ring after bearing it for 500 years), who takes it underground for five centuries, giving gollum \"unnaturally long life.\"\nthe ring leaves him however, and is found by the hobbit bilbo baggins (ian holm), much to the grief of gollum. bilbo returns to his home in the shire with the ring, and the story jumps forward in time sixty years.\nat his 111th birthday, bilbo leaves the ring to his nephew and adopted heir frodo baggins (elijah wood). the wizard gandalf (ian mckellen) investigates the ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that gollum was captured and brutally tortured by sauron's orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"shire\" and \"baggins.\"\ngandalf returns and warns frodo to leave the shire. frodo departs with his friend, gardener sam (sean astin) to bree, with plans to meet him there after gandalf goes to isengard to meet the head of his order, saruman (christopher lee). saruman reveals that the nazgul, or ringwraiths, have left mordor to capture the ring and kill whoever carries it; having already turned to sauron's cause, he then imprisons gandalf atop orthanc. frodo and sam are soon joined by fellow hobbits merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd). after encountering a ringwraith on the road, they manage to reach bree, and there they meet a man called strider (viggo mortensen), who agrees to lead them to rivendell. they agree only because gandalf isn't there to guide them. after some travelling, they spend the night on the hill of weathertop, where they are attacked by the nazgul at night. strider fights off the ringwraiths, but frodo is grievously wounded with a morgul blade, and they must quickly get him to rivendell for healing. while chased by the nazgul, frodo is taken by the elf arwen (liv tyler) (also strider's beloved) to the elvish haven of rivendell, and healed by her father, elrond (hugo weaving). in rivendell frodo meets gandalf, who explains why he didn't meet them at bree as planned. in the meantime, there are many meetings between various peoples, and elrond calls a council to decide what should be done with the ring. the ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires (that is, lava) of mount doom, where it was forged. mount doom is located in mordor, near sauron's fortress of barad-dur, and will be an incredibly dangerous journey. frodo volunteers to take the ring to mount doom as all the others argue about who should or shouldn't take it. he is accompanied by his hobbit friends and gandalf, as well as strider, who is revealed to be aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of gondor. bilbo, now living in rivendell, gives frodo his sword sting, and a chain-mail shirt made of mithril. also travelling with them are the elf legolas (orlando bloom), the dwarf gimli (john rhys-davies) and boromir (sean bean), the son of the steward of gondor. together they comprise the fellowship of the ring. the fellowship set out and try to pass the mountain caradhras, but they are stopped by saruman's wizardry. they are forced to travel under the mountain through the mines of moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end.\nafter journeying partway through the mines, pippin accidentally gives away their presence to a band of orcs. the fellowship then encounter a balrog (durin's bane is a balrog residing within the mines), an ancient demon of fire and shadow, at the bridge of khazad-dum. while the others escape, gandalf fends off the balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the balrog drags gandalf down into the darkness with him. the group flees to the elvish realm of lothlorien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, galadriel and her husband celeborn. galadriel privately informs frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the fellowship will try to take the ring. she also shows him a vision of the future in which sauron succeeds in enslaving middle-earth, including the shire.\nmeanwhile, saruman creates an army of uruk-hai in isengard to find and kill the fellowship.\nafter resting, they decide to travel on the river anduin towards parth galen. before they leave, galadriel gives frodo the phial of galadriel. after landing at parth galen, boromir tries to take the ring from frodo, who manages to escape by putting the ring on his finger and vanishing. knowing that the ring's temptation will be too strong for the fellowship, frodo decides to leave them and go to mordor alone. meanwhile, the rest of the fellowship are attacked by uruk-hai. merry and pippin, realizing that frodo is leaving, distract the orcs, allowing frodo to escape. boromir rushes to the aid of the two hobbits but is mortally wounded by the orc commander lurtz, and merry and pippin are captured.\naragorn, legolas, and gimli find boromir, who regrets attempting to steal the ring and dies. fearing the ring will corrupt his friends, frodo decides to travel to mordor alone, but allows sam to come along, recalling his promise to gandalf to look after him. as aragorn, legolas, and gimli set out to rescue merry and pippin, frodo and sam make their way down the pass of emyn muil, journeying on to mordor."

    "synopsis": [
      "shouting \"roma invicta!\" as his forces attack, general maximus decimus meridius (russell crowe) leads the roman army to victory against germanic barbarians in the year 180 a.d., ending a prolonged war and earning the esteem of elderly emperor marcus aurelius. although the dying aurelius has a son, commodus (joaquin phoenix), he decides to appoint temporary leadership to the morally-upstanding maximus, with a desire to eventually return power to the roman senate. aurelius informs maximus and offers him time to consider before informing commodus, who, in a bout of jealousy, murders his father. declaring himself the emperor, commodus asks maximus for his loyalty, which maximus, realizing commodus' involvement in the emperor's death, refuses. commodus orders maximus' execution and dispatches praetorian guards to murder maximus' wife and son. maximus narrowly escapes his execution and races home only to discover his family's charred and crucified bodies in the smoldering ruins of his villa. after burying his wife and son, a grieving maximus succumbs to exhaustion and collapses on their graves. slave traders find maximus and take him to zucchabar, a rugged province in north africa, where he is purchased by proximo, the head of a local gladiator school. distraught and nihilistic over the death of his family and betrayal by his empire, maximus initially refuses to fight, but as he defends himself in the arena his formidable combat skills lead to a rise in popularity with the audience. as he trains and fights further, maximus befriends hagen, a germanic barbarian, and juba, a numidian hunter, the latter becoming a close friend and confidant to the grieving maximus, the two speaking frequently of the afterlife and maximus' eventual reunification with his family. in rome, commodus reopens the gladiatorial games to commemorate his father's death, and proximo's company of gladiators are hired to participate. in a recreation of the battle of zama (incorrectly named the battle of carthage) at the colosseum, maximus leads proximo's gladiators to decisive victory against a more powerful force, much to the amazement of the crowd. commodus descends into the arena to meet the victors and is stunned to discover maximus as the leader of proximo's gladiators. the emperor, unable to kill maximus because of the crowd's roaring approval for him, sulks out of the arena. as the games continue, commodus pits maximus against tigris of gaul, rome's only undefeated gladiator, in an arena surrounded by chained tigers with handlers instructed to target maximus. following an intense battle, maximus narrowly defeats tigris and awaits commodus' decision to kill or spare tigris. as commodus votes for death, maximus spares tigris, deliberately insulting the emperor and garnering the audience's approval. his bitter enemy now known as \"maximus the merciful,\" commodus becomes more frustrated at his inability to kill maximus or stop his ascending popularity while commodus' own popularity shrinks. following the fight, maximus meets his former servant cicero, who reveals that maximus's army remains loyal to him. they are camped at the port ostia. maximus forms a plot with lucilla, commodus' sister, and senator gracchus to reunite maximus with his army and overthrow commodus. commodus however, suspecting his sister's betrayal, threatens her young son and forces her to reveal the plot. praetorian guards immediately storm proximo's gladiator barracks, battling the gladiators while maximus escapes. hagen and proximo are killed in the siege while juba and the survivors are imprisoned. maximus escapes to the city walls only to witness cicero's death and be ambushed by a legion of praetorian guards. concluding that legends born in the colosseum must die there, commodus personally challenges maximus to a duel in front of a roaring audience. acknowledging that maximus' skill exceeds his own, commodus deliberately stabs maximus with a stiletto, puncturing his lung, and has the wound concealed beneath the gladiator's armor. in the arena, the two exchange blows before maximus rips the sword from commodus's hands. commodus requests a sword from his guards, but they betray him and refuse to lend him their weapons. maximus drops his own sword, but commodus pulls a hidden stiletto and renews his attack. maximus then beats commodus into submission and kills him with his own stiletto. as commodus collapses in the now-silent colosseum, a dying maximus begins seeing his wife and son in the afterlife. he reaches for them but is pulled back to reality by the praetorian prefect quintus, who asks for instructions. maximus orders the release of proximo's gladiators and senator gracchus, whom he reinstates and instructs to return rome to a senate-based government. maximus collapses, and lucilla rushes to his aid. after being reassured that her son is safe and commodus is dead, maximus dies and wanders into the afterlife to his family in the distance. senator gracchus and proximo's gladiators carry his body out of the colosseum. that night, a newly freed juba buries maximus' two small statues of his wife and son in the colosseum, and says that he too will eventually join them, but not yet."

He rises in the ranks, befriends the Germanic gladiator Hagen and the Numidian Juba, and gains popularity with crowds. Commodus reopens the games in Rome; Proximo's troupe is hired and brought to the Colosseum. During a staged re-creation of a battle, Maximus leads Proximo’s men to victory, revealing himself to Commodus. Commodus, angered but unable to act because of Maximus's public support, later pits Maximus against Tigris of Gaul. Maximus defeats Tigris and spares him, further winning the crowd and earning the moniker “Maximus the Merciful.”\nCicero, Maximus's former servant, informs him that loyal legions under his command wait at the port of Ostia. Maximus, Senator Gracchus, and Lucilla (Commodus's sister) plot to use those forces to overthrow Commodus and restore the Senate. Commodus suspects Lucilla and coerces her to betray the conspiracy by threatening her son. Praetorian guards storm Proximo’s ludus; Proximo and Hagen are killed, survivors including Juba are imprisoned, and Maximus narrowly escapes. Cicero is killed in the ensuing pursuit. Commodus stages a public trial of the conspiracy and forces Maximus to face him in the arena. Behind the scenes, Commodus stabs Maximus with a concealed dagger, puncturing his lung, and disguises the wound under armor so the fight will look fair to the crowd.\nIn the final duel in the Colosseum, Maximus fights Commodus despite his mortal wound. Maximus disarms and incapacitates Commodus; Commodus draws a hidden stiletto and attacks but Maximus overpowers him and kills Commodus with the emperor's own blade. Mortally wounded, Maximus instructs Quintus to free Proximo's surviving gladiators and to reinstate Senator Gracchus to return Rome to senatorial rule. He reassures Lucilla that her son is safe, then dies. His body is carried from the arena; later Juba buries two small wooden figurines Maximus kept of his wife and son in the Colosseum.",

      "shouting \"roma invicta!\" as his forces attack, general maximus decimus meridius (russell crowe) leads the roman army to victory against germanic barbarians in the year 180 a.d., ending a prolonged war and earning the esteem of elderly emperor marcus aurelius. although the dying aurelius has a son, commodus (joaquin phoenix), he decides to appoint temporary leadership to the morally-upstanding maximus, with a desire to eventually return power to the roman senate. aurelius informs maximus and offers him time to consider before informing commodus, who, in a bout of jealousy, murders his father. declaring himself the emperor, commodus asks maximus for his loyalty, which maximus, realizing commodus' involvement in the emperor's death, refuses. commodus orders maximus' execution and dispatches praetorian guards to murder maximus' wife and son. maximus narrowly escapes his execution and races home only to discover his family's charred and crucified bodies in the smoldering ruins of his villa. after burying his wife and son, a grieving maximus succumbs to exhaustion and collapses on their graves. slave traders find maximus and take him to zucchabar, a rugged province in north africa, where he is purchased by proximo, the head of a local gladiator school. distraught and nihilistic over the death of his family and betrayal by his empire, maximus initially refuses to fight, but as he defends himself in the arena his formidable combat skills lead to a rise in popularity with the audience. as he trains and fights further, maximus befriends hagen, a germanic barbarian, and juba, a numidian hunter, the latter becoming a close friend and confidant to the grieving maximus, the two speaking frequently of the afterlife and maximus' eventual reunification with his family. in rome, commodus reopens the gladiatorial games to commemorate his father's death, and proximo's company of gladiators are hired to participate. in a recreation of the battle of zama (incorrectly named the battle of carthage) at the colosseum, maximus leads proximo's gladiators to decisive victory against a more powerful force, much to the amazement of the crowd. commodus descends into the arena to meet the victors and is stunned to discover maximus as the leader of proximo's gladiators. the emperor, unable to kill maximus because of the crowd's roaring approval for him, sulks out of the arena. as the games continue, commodus pits maximus against tigris of gaul, rome's only undefeated gladiator, in an arena surrounded by chained tigers with handlers instructed to target maximus. following an intense battle, maximus narrowly defeats tigris and awaits commodus' decision to kill or spare tigris. as commodus votes for death, maximus spares tigris, deliberately insulting the emperor and garnering the audience's approval. his bitter enemy now known as \"maximus the merciful,\" commodus becomes more frustrated at his inability to kill maximus or stop his ascending popularity while commodus' own popularity shrinks. following the fight, maximus meets his former servant cicero, who reveals that maximus's army remains loyal to him. they are camped at the port ostia. maximus forms a plot with lucilla, commodus' sister, and senator gracchus to reunite maximus with his army and overthrow commodus. commodus however, suspecting his sister's betrayal, threatens her young son and forces her to reveal the plot. praetorian guards immediately storm proximo's gladiator barracks, battling the gladiators while maximus escapes. hagen and proximo are killed in the siege while juba and the survivors are imprisoned. maximus escapes to the city walls only to witness cicero's death and be ambushed by a legion of praetorian guards. concluding that legends born in the colosseum must die there, commodus personally challenges maximus to a duel in front of a roaring audience. acknowledging that maximus' skill exceeds his own, commodus deliberately stabs maximus with a stiletto, puncturing his lung, and has the wound concealed beneath the gladiator's armor. in the arena, the two exchange blows before maximus rips the sword from commodus's hands. commodus requests a sword from his guards, but they betray him and refuse to lend him their weapons. maximus drops his own sword, but commodus pulls a hidden stiletto and renews his attack. maximus then beats commodus into submission and kills him with his own stiletto. as commodus collapses in the now-silent colosseum, a dying maximus begins seeing his wife and son in the afterlife. he reaches for them but is pulled back to reality by the praetorian prefect quintus, who asks for instructions. maximus orders the release of proximo's gladiators and senator gracchus, whom he reinstates and instructs to return rome to a senate-based government. maximus collapses, and lucilla rushes to his aid. after being reassured that her son is safe and commodus is dead, maximus dies and wanders into the afterlife to his family in the distance. senator gracchus and proximo's gladiators carry his body out of the colosseum. that night, a newly freed juba buries maximus' two small statues of his wife and son in the colosseum, and says that he too will eventually join them, but not yet."

      "dominick \"dom\" cobb (leonardo dicaprio) and business partner arthur (joseph gordon-levitt) are \"extractors\", people who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while experiencing shared dreaming. their latest target is japanese businessman saito (ken watanabe). the extraction from saito fails when sabotaged by a memory of cobb's deceased wife mal (marion cotillard). after cobb's and arthur's associate sells them out, saito reveals that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of \"inception\": planting an idea in a person's subconscious. in order to break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor maurice fischer (pete postlethwaite), saito wants cobb to plant the idea of dissolving the company into the mind of fischer's heir, son robert fischer (cillian murphy). should cobb succeed, saito tells cobb he will use his influence to clear cobb of a murder charge, which will allow cobb to return home and to his children. cobb accepts saito's offer. cobb sets about assembling his team: eames (tom hardy), a conman and identity forger; yusuf (dileep rao), a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable \"dream within a dream\" strategy; ariadne (elliot page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and arthur. saito insists on accompanying the team to verify the team's success. when the elder fischer dies in sydney, robert fischer accompanies the body on a flight back to los angeles, which the team uses as an opportunity to isolate fischer. cobb sedates him, bringing him into a shared dream with the extractors. using a \"dream within a dream\" strategy, at each level in the layered dreaming, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members who have entered another dream layer deeper. due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during the mission will result in entering limbo, an expanse of infinite raw subconscious. limbo is a space not dreamed by any one individual but is shared space where one mind can make drastic alterations of any kind. in the first level, yusuf's rainy downtown dream, the team abducts fischer; however, fischer's trained subconscious projections attack, wounding saito severely. eames temporarily takes the appearance of fischer's godfather, peter browning (tom berenger), to suggest fischer reconsider his father's will. yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by arthur. here, the extractors recruit fischer, convincing him that his kidnapping was orchestrated by browning and that they are fischer's subconscious dependency. in the third level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by eames, fischer is told they are in browning's subconscious, but they are really going deeper into fischer's. yusuf, under assault in the first level, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, removing the gravity of arthur's dream world and causing an avalanche in eames' dream, a kick which all missed. arthur improvises a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in eames' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks. saito succumbs to his wounds, and cobb's projection of mal sabotages the entire plan by killing fischer, sending them both into limbo. cobb and ariadne enter limbo to find fischer and saito, while eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. cobb reveals to ariadne that he spent \"50 years\" with mal in limbo constructing a world from their shared memories while seemingly growing old together. returning to the waking world, cobb and mal found less than three hours had passed. convinced she was still dreaming, mal committed suicide and tried to persuade cobb to do so too, by incriminating him in her death. facing a murder charge cobb fled the u.s., leaving his children behind, ostensibly in the shared care of his mother- and father-in-law, prof. stephen miles (michael caine). through his confession, cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in limbo to search for saito. ariadne pushes fischer off a balcony, resuscitating him at the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his \"own man\", and that splitting up the conglomerate might not be a radical notion. all team members other than cobb and saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: ariadne jumps off a balcony in limbo, eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in yusuf's dream hits the water. cobb eventually finds an aged saito in limbo and the two remember their arrangement, presumably shooting themselves and waking to outer-world reality back on the airplane, where the entire team and robert fischer have awakened. upon arriving in los angeles, cobb successfully passes through u.s. customs to his waiting father-in-law, who reunites him with his children. cobb attempts to determine if he is dreaming or awake by spinning a top but ignores its outcome to instead happily greet his family."

      "plot_summary": "Dominick \"Dom\" Cobb, an extractor who uses military dream-sharing technology to steal secrets from targets' subconscious, and his partner Arthur attempt an extraction on Japanese businessman Saito aboard a flight. The job is sabotaged by intrusions from Cobb's deceased wife Mal, who appears as a violent projection. The extraction fails and their associate Nash betrays them; Saito then reveals he was testing Cobb. Saito offers Cobb a deal: perform inception on Robert Michael Fischer Jr., heir to a corporate empire, by planting the idea that Fischer should dissolve his father's company; in return Saito will use his influence to clear Cobb's criminal charges so Cobb can return to his children in the U.S. Cobb accepts and assembles a team: Arthur (planner), Eames (forger/conman), Yusuf (chemistry/sedative), and Ariadne (architecture student to design dream levels). Saito insists on joining to verify success.\n\nWhen Fischer's father dies in Sydney, Fischer boards a flight to Los Angeles; the team abducts and sedates him to start a multi-level, layered dream (a dream within a dream) so the planted idea can be seeded deeper than Fischer's critical resistance. Yusuf engineers a powerful sedative to stabilize three nested dream levels, with synchronized \"kicks\" planned to wake each layer. On the first level (Yusuf's rainy downtown), the team stages Fischer's kidnapping and Eames impersonates Fischer's godfather Peter Browning to suggest Browning influenced Fischer's decisions. Fischer's subconscious projections aggressively defend him; Saito is shot and gravely wounded by those projections. The team moves into the second level (Arthur's hotel) where they pose as Browning's agents and coax Fischer toward accepting a manufactured narrative. In the third level (Eames's snowy mountain fortress), they push the idea that Fischer must be his own man. Yusuf, under attack in level one, initiates a premature kick by driving the van off a bridge, which causes timing problems and gravity disruptions cascading through the layers; the planned kicks misfire.\n\nAs the mission unravels, Cobb's projection of Mal increasingly intrudes, sabotaging the operation by convincing Fischer to die in the third level; Fischer and the mortally wounded Saito fall into limbo, a raw, unconstructed subconscious where time stretches and death results in being trapped rather than waking. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal had been trapped in limbo years earlier and spent decades building an elaborate shared world; when they escaped, Mal became convinced they were still dreaming and committed suicide, framing Cobb to make him join her; Cobb fled the U.S. and became a fugitive, and Mal's projection is now a defense mechanism that tries to keep Cobb from returning home.\n\nTo finish inception, Ariadne pushes Fischer off a balcony in the fortress to force him into limbo, then resuscitates him so the team can complete the planting. Eames rigs explosives to create a synchronized kick in the fortress; Arthur improvises a kick in the hotel elevator; Yusuf times the van's plunge into water; and Ariadne times her jump. Cobb and Ariadne descend into limbo to locate Fischer and the wounded Saito. Ariadne forces Cobb to confront Mal; she pulls Fischer out of limbo and the planted idea crystallizes: Fischer, in a safe room, finds Browning's forged will and accepts that he should dissolve his father's company to become his own man. Most team members return through the layered kicks to reality and wake on the airplane; Yusuf, Eames, Arthur, Ariadne, Fischer and Saito all awaken. Cobb stays in limbo to find the aged Saito; they recall their bargain and shoot themselves to return to the airplane. Back in Los Angeles, Cobb passes through U.S. immigration cleared by Saito's influence and meets Professor Stephen Miles, who reunites him with his children. Before greeting them, Cobb spins his totem (a top) to test reality but, seeing his children, sets it aside and goes to them, leaving the top's final state ambiguous.",

    "synopsis": [
      "in 1999, in an unnamed city, computer programmer thomas anderson (keanu reeves) is secretly a hacker known as \"neo\". he is restless, eager and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to the \"matrix\" appearing on his computer.\na woman named trinity is observing neo, and she does so knowing that morpheus believes that neo is \"the one\". during one of her forays, trinity is tracked down by the local police to her hotel room. outside the hotel a car drives up and three agents appear in neatly pressed black suits. they are agent smith (hugo weaving), agent brown (paul goddard), and agent jones (robert taylor). trinity calls morpheus and says that her line was tracked and morpheus orders her to find another exit.\ntrinity easily defeats the six policemen sent to apprehend her, using fighting and evasion techniques that seem to defy gravity. a fierce rooftop chase ensues with trinity and an agent leaping impossibly from one building to the next, astonishing the policemen left behind. trinity makes a daring leap across an alley and through a small window. trinity makes it to a public phone booth on the street level. the phone begins to ring. as she approaches it a garbage truck, driven by agent smith, careens towards the phone booth. trinity makes a desperate dash to the phone, picking it up just moments before the truck smashes the booth into a brick wall. the three agents find no body in the wreckage. \"she got out,\" one says. the other says, \"the informant is real.\" \"we have the name of their next target,\" says the other, \"his name is neo.\" notices about a manhunt for a man named morpheus scroll across neo's screen as he sleeps. suddenly neo's screen goes blank, and a series of text messages appear: \"wake up, neo.\" \"the matrix has you.\" \"follow the white rabbit.\" a group of ravers comes to neo and neo gives them a contraband disc he has secreted in a copy of \"simulacra and simulation.\" the lead raver asks him to join them and neo demurs until he sees the tattoo of a small white rabbit on the shoulder of a seductive girl in the group. trinity approaches neo at the rave bar. neo recognizes her name as she was a famous hacker and had cracked the irs database.\na female hacker named trinity (carrie-anne moss) confirms that a man named morpheus (laurence fishburne) can help him. neo works at metacortex, a leading software company housed in an ominous high rise. at his desk, neo finds a package with a phone, which rings. on the other end is morpheus, who informs neo that they've both run out of time and that \"they\" are coming for him. morpheus tells him to slowly look up, toward the elevator. agents smith, jones, and brown are there, obviously looking for him, as a woman points towards neo's cube. three sinister agents, led by agent smith (hugo weaving), come to arrest neo and attempt to prevent him from collaborating with morpheus. morpheus guides neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements. morpheus tries to guide neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof neo rejects morpheus' advice, allowing himself to be taken by the agents. the agents interrogate neo about morpheus, but he refuses to cooperate. agent smith asks him to help them capture morpheus, considered a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty. neo gives them the finger and asks for his phone call. in response, neo's mouth suddenly seals shut, and the agents implant a robotic device in his abdomen. neo awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare. neo awakens with a start in his own bed. morpheus is on the other line. morpheus tells neo he is the one and to meet him at the adams st. bridge. there he is picked up by trinity and two others in a car. a woman in the front seat, switch (belinda mcclory) uses a device to remove the probe that neo believed had been part of a nightmare. trinity drops the bug out into the road where it slowly goes dark in the rain.\ntrinity and her allies bring neo to morpheus, their leader. undeterred, neo meets with morpheus. morpheus offers neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life. neo agrees to follow him by swallowing an offered red pill. as the rest of morpheus's crew straps him into a chair, neo is told that pill he took is part of a trace program, to \"disrupt his input/output carrier signal\" so that they can pinpoint him.\nopting for the red pill, neo's reality distorts, and he awakens submerged in a liquid-filled, mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body. he is hairless and naked, with thick black tubes snaking down his throat, plugged into the back of his skull, his spine, and invading most of the rest of his body. neo is connected along with thousands of other people to an elaborate electrical structure. suddenly a menacing, hovering nurse robot grabs him by the throat. the cable inserted into the base of his skull suddenly detaches. the rest of the tubes pop off his limbs and neo is flushed down a tube into an underground pool of filthy water. just as he's about to drown in the muck a hovercraft appears above him, snags him and hauls him into its cargo bay. he is rescued by morpheus and brought aboard a levitating ship called the nebuchadnezzar. morpheus's crew includes trinity, apoc (julian arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair, switch, cypher (bald with a goatee), two brawny brothers, tank (marcus chong) and dozer (anthony ray parker), and a young, thin man named mouse (matt doran). morpheus gets to the point. \"you wanted to know about the matrix,\" he says, ushering him to a chair. neo sits down in it and trinity straps him in. a long probe is inserted into the socket at the back of neo's skull. neo wakes in a world of all white. he is in the construct, a \"loading platform\" that morpheus and his team use to prepare newly freed humans to deal with the matrix world. gone are the sockets in neo's arms and neck and his hair is grown in. morpheus tells him that what he is experiencing of himself is the \"residual self image, the mental projection of your digital self\" and bids him to sit while he explains the truth. \"this,\" he says, showing an image of a modern city, \"is the world that you know.\" a thing that really exists \"only as part of a neural, interactive simulation that we call the matrix.\"\nmorpheus then shows neo the world as it truly exists today, a scarred, desolate emptiness with charred, abandoned buildings, black earth, and a shrouded sky. morpheus tells neo that the year is approximately 2199, and humans are fighting against intelligent machines that were created early in the 21st century and have since taken control of the earth's surface. humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations, leaving the earth a devastated ruin. as a last resort, humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines' access to solar power and, in response, the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bio-electric energy. a human's body provides \"more electricity than a 120 volt battery and over 25k btus in body heat.\" morpheus shows neo fields where machines grow human beings, connecting them to their outlets, ensconcing them in their pods, and feeding them with the liquefied remains of other human beings. \"the matrix,\" says morpheus, \"is a computer-generated dreamworld created to keep us under control, to turn us\" into a mere power source, into copper-top batteries. the remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as zion, living a harsh existence on scarce resources.\nthe humans are kept docile within the matrix, a simulated reality of the world as it was in 1999. the matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak, designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified. that simulation is the world neo has been living in since birth. morpheus and his crew belong to a group of free humans who \"unplug\" others from the matrix and recruit them to their rebellion against the machines, and who are able to gain superhuman abilities within the matrix by using their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its physical laws. even so, they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful agents-sentient programs protecting the matrix-and dying in the matrix causes death in the real world. when the matrix was created there was a man born inside it who could create his own reality inside it. it was this man who set morpheus and the others free. when he died, the oracle (gloria foster) prophesied that he would return in another form. and that the return of the one would mean the destruction of the matrix.\nmorpheus liberated neo because he believes him to be \"the one\", a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the matrix and liberate humanity by ending the war with the machines. the next day neo starts his training. tank is his operator. tank and his brother dozer are \"100% pure old-fashioned, homegrown human. born in the real world; a genuine child of zion.\" zion, tank explains, is the last human city, buried deep in the earth, near the core, for warmth. tank straps neo back into the jack-in chair, by-passes some preliminary programs and loads him up with combat training, starting with jiu jitsu. neo is fed a series of martial arts techniques including kempo, tae kwon do, drunken boxing and kung fu. morpheus and tank are amazed at neo's ability to ingest information, but morpheus wants to test neo. morpheus and neo stand in a sparring program. the program has rules, like gravity. but as in many computer programs, some rules can be bent while others can be broken. morpheus bids neo to hit him, if he can. they fight with neo impressively attacking but morpheus easily parrying and subduing him. morpheus ends up kicking neo into a beam, explaining to him that the reason he has beaten him has nothing to do with muscles or reality. neo finally brings a punch near his teacher's face. a \"jump\" program is loaded. both men now stand on one of several tall buildings in a normal city skyline. morpheus tells neo he must free his mind and leaps easily but impossibly from one building to the next. neo nervously tries to follow him and doesn't make the jump, falling to the pavement below.\nmorpheus and neo are walking down a standard city street in what appears to be the matrix. morpheus explains that the matrix is a system and that the system is their enemy. all the people that inhabit it, the people they are trying to free, are part of that system. some are so inert, so dependent upon the matrix that they can never be free. neo asks what the agents are. \"sentient programs,\" says morpheus, that \"can move in and out of any software hard-wired into their system, meaning that they can take over anyone in the matrix program. \"inside the matrix,\" morpheus says, \"they are everyone and they are no one.\" thus morpheus and his crew survive the agents by running from them and hiding from the agents even though they \"are guarding all the doors. they are holding all the keys and sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.\" but no one who has ever stood up to an agent has survived; all have died. still, morpheus is certain that because the agents live in a world of rules that they can never be as strong, never be as fast as he can be. \"what are you trying to tell me,\" asks neo, \"that i can dodge bullets?\" \"when you're ready,\" morpheus says, \"you won't have to.\" the nebuchadnezzar is on alert. they see the holographic image of a squiddy, a search and destroy sentinel, which is on their trail. they set the ship down in a huge sewer system and turn off the power. tank stands at the ready switch of an emp, electro-magnetic pulse, the only weapon man has against the machines in the real world. two squiddies search for the ship -- the crew can see them -- but they move on. cypher meets with agent smith inside the matrix. smith says he wants access codes to the mainframe in zion. cypher says he can't do that, but that he can get him the man who does, meaning morpheus. the deal is that the machines to reinsert his body into a power plant, reinsert him into the matrix, and he'll help the agents. the group enters the matrix to visit the oracle, who predicted the emergence of the one. as they walk out of a warehouse cypher secretly throws his cell phone into the garbage. the oracle, morpheus explains, has been with them since the beginning of the resistance. she is the one who made the prophecy of the one and that morpheus would be the one to find him.\nthe oracle implies that neo is not the one but warns that neo must soon choose between his life and that of morpheus. the group is ambushed by agents and tactical police, leading to the death of the crew member mouse (matt doran). morpheus allows himself to be captured to let neo and the crew escape. their ally cypher (joe pantoliano) had betrayed them.\nmeanwhile, cypher exits the matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others, killing them. before cypher can kill neo and trinity, tank (marcus chong), a subdued crew member, regains consciousness, kills cypher, and safely extracts the survivors. the agents drug and interrogate morpheus in an attempt to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in zion, the humans' subterranean refuge in the real world. he informs morpheus, who is tied to a chair, that the first matrix was designed as a utopia, engineered to make everyone happy. \"it was a disaster,\" says agent smith, people wouldn't accept the program and \"entire crops were lost.\" \"some believed,\" continues smith, \"that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. but i believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was redesigned.\" tank is performing what amounts to last rites for morpheus, laying one hand on his head as his other moves to the back of his skull to remove the jack. just as he's about to pull it out neo stops him. he realizes that the oracle was right. he now has to make the choice to save himself or to save morpheus; his choice is to head back into the matrix. trinity rejects the idea. morpheus gave himself up so that neo could be saved since he is the one. \"i'm not the one, trinity,\" neo says, relaying his understanding of the discussion with the oracle: she did not enlighten him as to whether he was the promised messiah. and, since morpheus was willing to sacrifice himself, neo knows that he must do that same. neo and trinity return to the matrix and rescue their leader; in the process, neo becomes more confident in his ability to manipulate the matrix and is ultimately able to dodge bullets fired at him. morpheus and trinity use a telephone to exit the matrix, but neo is ambushed by agent smith. he stands his ground and defeats smith but flees when the agent possesses another body. meanwhile, in the real world \"sentinel\" machines converge on the nebuchadnezzar. just before reaching another exit, neo is shot and killed by agent smith. trinity, who is standing over neo in the real world, whispers that the oracle told her she would fall in love with the one. she kisses neo and restores his life. neo revives with new power to perceive and control the matrix, and effortlessly destroys agent smith, before returning to the real world in time for the ship's emp weapon to destroy the attacking sentinels. the film ends with neo back in the matrix, making a telephone call promising that he will demonstrate to the people imprisoned in the matrix that \"anything is possible.\" he hangs up the phone and flies into the sky."

      "plot_summary": "In 1999, Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a London-based computer programmer who moonlights as hacker \"Neo,\" notices cryptic references to the \"Matrix\" on his computer. Neo is observed by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who believes Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is searching for Neo as the prophesied \"One.\" Trinity narrowly evades arrest by three agents—Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), Agent Brown, and Agent Jones—and the agents learn Neo's name. Neo receives messages on his computer: \"wake up, Neo,\" \"the Matrix has you,\" \"follow the white rabbit.\" He meets Trinity at a rave after seeing a white rabbit tattoo and is later contacted by Morpheus by phone as agents close in at Neo's workplace, MetaCortex. Guided by Morpheus over the phone, Neo panics and is captured; agents implant a bug in him. Neo wakes at home; Morpheus arranges a physical extraction. Trinity and the Nebuchadnezzar crew (Apoc, Switch, Cypher, Tank, Dozer, Mouse) remove the bug and bring Neo aboard Morpheus's ship. Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a blue pill to forget or a red pill to learn the truth. Neo swallows the red pill: his perceived world collapses and he awakens naked in a pod in a vast factory where humans are grown and harvested by machines. The Nebuchadnezzar rescues him and brings him into the real-world refuge of the ship.\n\nMorpheus explains that the visible 1999 world is the Matrix, a neural-interactive simulation created by sentient machines that harvest human bioelectricity. The real Earth is a scorched wasteland; survivors live underground in the human city Zion. Morpheus believes Neo is the reincarnation of \"the One,\" who can rewrite the Matrix's rules and end the machine domination. Neo undergoes training: virtual combat, kung fu programs loaded into his mind, and simulated exercises to learn to bend Matrix physics. During a rooftop \"jump\" exercise Neo fails to emulate Morpheus. Morpheus teaches Neo that the Matrix is a system and the agents are sentient programs that can possess any connected human in the simulation.\n\nWhile the Nebuchadnezzar is trailed by machine squiddies in the real world, crew member Cypher secretly meets Agent Smith and conspires to betray Morpheus in exchange for being reinserted into the Matrix with his memories erased. Morpheus takes Neo and the crew to visit the Oracle (Gloria Foster). The Oracle suggests Neo may not be the One but warns he will soon face a choice between his life and Morpheus's. On returning from the Oracle, the team is ambushed by agents and tactical police inside the Matrix. Mouse is killed; Morpheus is captured after allowing himself to be taken so Neo and Trinity can escape. Back on the Nebuchadnezzar, Cypher unplugs and begins killing crew members in the real world to aid the agents; Tank kills Cypher and extracts Neo, Trinity, and the wounded survivors.\n\nAgents interrogate Morpheus in the Matrix to extract Zion's mainframe access codes. Neo decides to re-enter the Matrix to rescue Morpheus despite Trinity's doubts and the Oracle's ambiguous counsel. Neo and Trinity re-enter, locate Morpheus in a skyscraper building used as an extraction point, and free him while fighting SWAT teams and agents. Neo's ability to manipulate the Matrix grows: he begins to dodge bullets. As they flee to a pay phone to exit, Agent Smith ambushes Neo. Neo fights Smith and defeats him momentarily, but Smith overwrites his body and escapes. In the real world, sentinels converge on the Nebuchadnezzar; the ship's EMP destroys them just after Neo is shot by Smith and collapses in the Matrix. Trinity, at Neo's side in the real world, whispers that the Oracle said she would fall in love with the One and kisses Neo. Her kiss and her declaration revive him. Neo awakens with fully realized power in the Matrix, perceives and alters its code at will, and destroys Agent Smith. He rejoins the Nebuchadnezzar and, back in the Matrix, places a call to the agents and to the people trapped in the simulation, declaring he will show them \"anything is possible,\" then flies upward and away into the sky.",

      "in 1999, in an unnamed city, computer programmer thomas anderson (keanu reeves) is secretly a hacker known as \"neo\". he is restless, eager and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to the \"matrix\" appearing on his computer.\na woman named trinity is observing neo, and she does so knowing that morpheus believes that neo is \"the one\". during one of her forays, trinity is tracked down by the local police to her hotel room. outside the hotel a car drives up and three agents appear in neatly pressed black suits. they are agent smith (hugo weaving), agent brown (paul goddard), and agent jones (robert taylor). trinity calls morpheus and says that her line was tracked and morpheus orders her to find another exit.\ntrinity easily defeats the six policemen sent to apprehend her, using fighting and evasion techniques that seem to defy gravity. a fierce rooftop chase ensues with trinity and an agent leaping impossibly from one building to the next, astonishing the policemen left behind. trinity makes a daring leap across an alley and through a small window. trinity makes it to a public phone booth on the street level. the phone begins to ring. as she approaches it a garbage truck, driven by agent smith, careens towards the phone booth. trinity makes a desperate dash to the phone, picking it up just moments before the truck smashes the booth into a brick wall. the three agents find no body in the wreckage. \"she got out,\" one says. the other says, \"the informant is real.\" \"we have the name of their next target,\" says the other, \"his name is neo.\" notices about a manhunt for a man named morpheus scroll across neo's screen as he sleeps. suddenly neo's screen goes blank, and a series of text messages appear: \"wake up, neo.\" \"the matrix has you.\" \"follow the white rabbit.\" a group of ravers comes to neo and neo gives them a contraband disc he has secreted in a copy of \"simulacra and simulation.\" the lead raver asks him to join them and neo demurs until he sees the tattoo of a small white rabbit on the shoulder of a seductive girl in the group. trinity approaches neo at the rave bar. neo recognizes her name as she was a famous hacker and had cracked the irs database.\na female hacker named trinity (carrie-anne moss) confirms that a man named morpheus (laurence fishburne) can help him. neo works at metacortex, a leading software company housed in an ominous high rise. at his desk, neo finds a package with a phone, which rings. on the other end is morpheus, who informs neo that they've both run out of time and that \"they\" are coming for him. morpheus tells him to slowly look up, toward the elevator. agents smith, jones, and brown are there, obviously looking for him, as a woman points towards neo's cube. three sinister agents, led by agent smith (hugo weaving), come to arrest neo and attempt to prevent him from collaborating with morpheus. morpheus guides neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements. morpheus tries to guide neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof neo rejects morpheus' advice, allowing himself to be taken by the agents. the agents interrogate neo about morpheus, but he refuses to cooperate. agent smith asks him to help them capture morpheus, considered a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty. neo gives them the finger and asks for his phone call. in response, neo's mouth suddenly seals shut, and the agents implant a robotic device in his abdomen. neo awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare. neo awakens with a start in his own bed. morpheus is on the other line. morpheus tells neo he is the one and to meet him at the adams st. bridge. there he is picked up by trinity and two others in a car. a woman in the front seat, switch (belinda mcclory) uses a device to remove the probe that neo believed had been part of a nightmare. trinity drops the bug out into the road where it slowly goes dark in the rain.\ntrinity and her allies bring neo to morpheus, their leader. undeterred, neo meets with morpheus. morpheus offers neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life. neo agrees to follow him by swallowing an offered red pill. as the rest of morpheus's crew straps him into a chair, neo is told that pill he took is part of a trace program, to \"disrupt his input/output carrier signal\" so that they can pinpoint him.\nopting for the red pill, neo's reality distorts, and he awakens submerged in a liquid-filled, mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body. he is hairless and naked, with thick black tubes snaking down his throat, plugged into the back of his skull, his spine, and invading most of the rest of his body. neo is connected along with thousands of other people to an elaborate electrical structure. suddenly a menacing, hovering nurse robot grabs him by the throat. the cable inserted into the base of his skull suddenly detaches. the rest of the tubes pop off his limbs and neo is flushed down a tube into an underground pool of filthy water. just as he's about to drown in the muck a hovercraft appears above him, snags him and hauls him into its cargo bay. he is rescued by morpheus and brought aboard a levitating ship called the nebuchadnezzar. morpheus's crew includes trinity, apoc (julian arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair, switch, cypher (bald with a goatee), two brawny brothers, tank (marcus chong) and dozer (anthony ray parker), and a young, thin man named mouse (matt doran). morpheus gets to the point. \"you wanted to know about the matrix,\" he says, ushering him to a chair. neo sits down in it and trinity straps him in. a long probe is inserted into the socket at the back of neo's skull. neo wakes in a world of all white. he is in the construct, a \"loading platform\" that morpheus and his team use to prepare newly freed humans to deal with the matrix world. gone are the sockets in neo's arms and neck and his hair is grown in. morpheus tells him that what he is experiencing of himself is the \"residual self image, the mental projection of your digital self\" and bids him to sit while he explains the truth. \"this,\" he says, showing an image of a modern city, \"is the world that you know.\" a thing that really exists \"only as part of a neural, interactive simulation that we call the matrix.\"\nmorpheus then shows neo the world as it truly exists today, a scarred, desolate emptiness with charred, abandoned buildings, black earth, and a shrouded sky. morpheus tells neo that the year is approximately 2199, and humans are fighting against intelligent machines that were created early in the 21st century and have since taken control of the earth's surface. humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations, leaving the earth a devastated ruin. as a last resort, humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines' access to solar power and, in response, the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bio-electric energy. a human's body provides \"more electricity than a 120 volt battery and over 25k btus in body heat.\" morpheus shows neo fields where machines grow human beings, connecting them to their outlets, ensconcing them in their pods, and feeding them with the liquefied remains of other human beings. \"the matrix,\" says morpheus, \"is a computer-generated dreamworld created to keep us under control, to turn us\" into a mere power source, into copper-top batteries. the remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as zion, living a harsh existence on scarce resources.\nthe humans are kept docile within the matrix, a simulated reality of the world as it was in 1999. the matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak, designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified. that simulation is the world neo has been living in since birth. morpheus and his crew belong to a group of free humans who \"unplug\" others from the matrix and recruit them to their rebellion against the machines, and who are able to gain superhuman abilities within the matrix by using their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its physical laws. even so, they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful agents-sentient programs protecting the matrix-and dying in the matrix causes death in the real world. when the matrix was created there was a man born inside it who could create his own reality inside it. it was this man who set morpheus and the others free. when he died, the oracle (gloria foster) prophesied that he would return in another form. and that the return of the one would mean the destruction of the matrix.\nmorpheus liberated neo because he believes him to be \"the one\", a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the matrix and liberate humanity by ending the war with the machines. the next day neo starts his training. tank is his operator. tank and his brother dozer are \"100% pure old-fashioned, homegrown human. born in the real world; a genuine child of zion.\" zion, tank explains, is the last human city, buried deep in the earth, near the core, for warmth. tank straps neo back into the jack-in chair, by-passes some preliminary programs and loads him up with combat training, starting with jiu jitsu. neo is fed a series of martial arts techniques including kempo, tae kwon do, drunken boxing and kung fu. morpheus and tank are amazed at neo's ability to ingest information, but morpheus wants to test neo. morpheus and neo stand in a sparring program. the program has rules, like gravity. but as in many computer programs, some rules can be bent while others can be broken. morpheus bids neo to hit him, if he can. they fight with neo impressively attacking but morpheus easily parrying and subduing him. morpheus ends up kicking neo into a beam, explaining to him that the reason he has beaten him has nothing to do with muscles or reality. neo finally brings a punch near his teacher's face. a \"jump\" program is loaded. both men now stand on one of several tall buildings in a normal city skyline. morpheus tells neo he must free his mind and leaps easily but impossibly from one building to the next. neo nervously tries to follow him and doesn't make the jump, falling to the pavement below.\nmorpheus and neo are walking down a standard city street in what appears to be the matrix. morpheus explains that the matrix is a system and that the system is their enemy. all the people that inhabit it, the people they are trying to free, are part of that system. some are so inert, so dependent upon the matrix that they can never be free. neo asks what the agents are. \"sentient programs,\" says morpheus, that \"can move in and out of any software hard-wired into their system, meaning that they can take over anyone in the matrix program. \"inside the matrix,\" morpheus says, \"they are everyone and they are no one.\" thus morpheus and his crew survive the agents by running from them and hiding from the agents even though they \"are guarding all the doors. they are holding all the keys and sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.\" but no one who has ever stood up to an agent has survived; all have died. still, morpheus is certain that because the agents live in a world of rules that they can never be as strong, never be as fast as he can be. \"what are you trying to tell me,\" asks neo, \"that i can dodge bullets?\" \"when you're ready,\" morpheus says, \"you won't have to.\" the nebuchadnezzar is on alert. they see the holographic image of a squiddy, a search and destroy sentinel, which is on their trail. they set the ship down in a huge sewer system and turn off the power. tank stands at the ready switch of an emp, electro-magnetic pulse, the only weapon man has against the machines in the real world. two squiddies search for the ship -- the crew can see them -- but they move on. cypher meets with agent smith inside the matrix. smith says he wants access codes to the mainframe in zion. cypher says he can't do that, but that he can get him the man who does, meaning morpheus. the deal is that the machines to reinsert his body into a power plant, reinsert him into the matrix, and he'll help the agents. the group enters the matrix to visit the oracle, who predicted the emergence of the one. as they walk out of a warehouse cypher secretly throws his cell phone into the garbage. the oracle, morpheus explains, has been with them since the beginning of the resistance. she is the one who made the prophecy of the one and that morpheus would be the one to find him.\nthe oracle implies that neo is not the one but warns that neo must soon choose between his life and that of morpheus. the group is ambushed by agents and tactical police, leading to the death of the crew member mouse (matt doran). morpheus allows himself to be captured to let neo and the crew escape. their ally cypher (joe pantoliano) had betrayed them.\nmeanwhile, cypher exits the matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others, killing them. before cypher can kill neo and trinity, tank (marcus chong), a subdued crew member, regains consciousness, kills cypher, and safely extracts the survivors. the agents drug and interrogate morpheus in an attempt to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in zion, the humans' subterranean refuge in the real world. he informs morpheus, who is tied to a chair, that the first matrix was designed as a utopia, engineered to make everyone happy. \"it was a disaster,\" says agent smith, people wouldn't accept the program and \"entire crops were lost.\" \"some believed,\" continues smith, \"that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. but i believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was redesigned.\" tank is performing what amounts to last rites for morpheus, laying one hand on his head as his other moves to the back of his skull to remove the jack. just as he's about to pull it out neo stops him. he realizes that the oracle was right. he now has to make the choice to save himself or to save morpheus; his choice is to head back into the matrix. trinity rejects the idea. morpheus gave himself up so that neo could be saved since he is the one. \"i'm not the one, trinity,\" neo says, relaying his understanding of the discussion with the oracle: she did not enlighten him as to whether he was the promised messiah. and, since morpheus was willing to sacrifice himself, neo knows that he must do that same. neo and trinity return to the matrix and rescue their leader; in the process, neo becomes more confident in his ability to manipulate the matrix and is ultimately able to dodge bullets fired at him. morpheus and trinity use a telephone to exit the matrix, but neo is ambushed by agent smith. he stands his ground and defeats smith but flees when the agent possesses another body. meanwhile, in the real world \"sentinel\" machines converge on the nebuchadnezzar. just before reaching another exit, neo is shot and killed by agent smith. trinity, who is standing over neo in the real world, whispers that the oracle told her she would fall in love with the one. she kisses neo and restores his life. neo revives with new power to perceive and control the matrix, and effortlessly destroys agent smith, before returning to the real world in time for the ship's emp weapon to destroy the attacking sentinels. the film ends with neo back in the matrix, making a telephone call promising that he will demonstrate to the people imprisoned in the matrix that \"anything is possible.\" he hangs up the phone and flies into the sky."

      "in the future, crop blight has caused civilization to regress into a failing agrarian society. former nasa pilot cooper (matthew mcconaughey) runs a farm with his family. humanity needs more farmers to feed the world & the current scientific thinking believes that nasa apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the soviets (a belief that pisses cooper off like nothing else). murphy (mackenzie foy), cooper's 10-year-old daughter, believes her room is haunted by a ghost trying to communicate with her. cooper also has a son (timothée chalamet) they discover the \"ghost\" is an unknown intelligence sending coded messages using gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in the dust that direct them to a secret nasa installation led by professor john brand (michael caine). dr brand tells cooper that every year one crop dies & gets eliminated from the planet forever due to change in climatic conditions & severity of the dust storms. soon, no crop will ever grow on earth & the species will starve to death. brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence (& first discovered 48 yrs ago), leads to new planets that may offer hope for survival. nasa's \"lazarus missions\" have identified three potentially habitable worlds orbiting the black hole gargantua: miller, edmunds, and mann, named after the astronauts who surveyed them. originally 12 astronauts were sent to 12 different worlds. their craft had hibernation capabilities through which the astronauts could live on for decades & wait to be rescued after transmitting habitat data back to earth. but if the planet was assessed to be uninhabitable, there was no plan for rescue as earth did not have the resources to again visit all 12 planets. brand recruits cooper to pilot the spacecraft endurance to recover the astronauts' data from the 3 planets; if one of the planets is habitable, humanity will follow on space stations. but brand has still not solved the problem of lifting enough of humanity into space & to the identified planet. so plan b is to population bomb the identified planet with human embryos. the endurance will carry 5000 human embryos, of which 10 will be incubated & once they grow up, they will be artificially inseminated so as to create a colony of 100s of humans in a few decades.\ncooper's departure devastates murphy, and they part on bad terms. add something about the video he watches of his son on endurance, cooper joins brand's daughter, bio-technologist amelia (anne hathaway) (& brand's daughter); scientists romilly (david gyasi) and doyle (wes bentley); and robots tars and case. amelia tells cooper that mann was the leader of the expedition that took 12 brave people to uncharted territory. amelia has great respect for mann. they enter the wormhole and head to miller (as the meager data provided by the respective explorers puts miller's planet as the best option), but discover the planet is so close to gargantua that it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: each hour on the surface is seven years on earth. a team descends to the planet, which proves inhospitable as it is covered by a shallow ocean roiled by enormous tidal waves. as amelia attempts to recover miller's data, a wave hits, killing doyle and delaying the shuttle's departure. when the others return to endurance, 23 years have passed. murphy is now grown up & is working with dr brand (who is now very old) in solving the gravity equation that is the key to lifting the humanity off earth in an attempt to recolonize another planet, as per plan a. on earth, the adult murphy (jessica chastain) is now a nasa scientist assisting brand with an equation that will enable nasa to launch the space stations via gravity. on his deathbed, brand admits he already solved the gravity problem and determined that project is impossible as he needed more data from a black hole singularity to completely solve the equation. he concealed his findings to keep hope alive and put his faith in \"plan b\": using frozen embryos aboard the endurance to start humanity anew. he also knew that there was no way back to earth via the wormhole. however, murphy concludes that brand's equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity. low on fuel, endurance can only visit one more planet before returning to earth. after a tense vote, the team selects mann's planet, as mann is still transmitting. amelia wanted to take endurance to edmund's planet as the data showed organic life, but mann's data was more recent (but showed no organic life). amelia's theory was that the 3 planets were orbiting a giant black hole & hence all accidents that happened in the universe to create life, simply did not happen in this system, so no asteroids, comets nothing. her point was that planet showing organic life hence had more promise. however, they discover mann's planet is icy and inhospitable; mann (matt damon) always knew plan b was the mission's true goal (he even tells cooper that brand knew that he needed a black hole's singularity data before mann left earth. and singularity data is impossible as it hides behind a black hole, through which light itself cannot escape). romily suggests that the robot tars can enter the black hole horizon of gargantuan fast enough & just might survive long enough to transmit data on the singularity. mann faked data about his planet's viability so endurance would rescue him. mann breaks cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, and flees to endurance on a shuttle; romilly is killed by a bomb mann set to protect his secret. amelia rescues cooper on the other shuttle, and they arrive at endurance in time to witness mann docking improperly. the airlock explodes, killing mann and causing serious damage, but cooper uses the shuttle to get endurance under control. nearly out of fuel, cooper and amelia plan to slingshot endurance around gargantua on a course toward edmunds. due to being directly in the heavy gravity of gargantua, several more decades actually pass back on earth while tars and cooper detach into the black hole, sacrificing themselves to collect data on the singularity and to propel amelia by dropping the ship's mass. they emerge in an extra-dimensional \"tesseract\", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of murphy's childhood bedroom at various times. cooper realizes the alien beings are future humans who have constructed this space so he can communicate with murphy and save humanity. using gravitational waves, cooper encodes tars's data on the singularity into the adult murphy's watch, allowing her to solve brand's equation and evacuate earth. cooper somehow is ejected from the singularity & awakens aboard a nasa space station near saturn and reunites with the now elderly murphy (ellen burstyn), who has led humanity's exodus. murphy convinces cooper to search for amelia and case, who have completed their one-way trip to edmunds' planet, and are setting plan b into motion."

      "plot_summary": "In a near-future agrarian United States, former NASA pilot Joseph “Cooper” Cooper runs a farm in the Midwest with his daughter Murphy (“Murph”) and son Tom as global blight and massive dust storms collapse food production. Murph discovers apparent paranormal gravitational anomalies in her bedroom that send binary coordinates in the dust; Cooper and Murph follow them to a secret NASA facility led by Professor John Brand. Brand explains a wormhole near Saturn — placed there 48 years earlier by an unknown intelligence — leads to a different galaxy with twelve candidate worlds surveyed by the Lazarus missions. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the exploration craft Endurance with Brand’s daughter Dr. Amelia Brand, physicist Romilly, pilot Doyle, and two robot units, TARS and CASE, to retrieve data from the three most promising worlds (Miller, Edmunds, Mann) orbiting the black hole Gargantua so humanity can relocate via large space stations. Cooper leaves against Murph’s wishes; they separate bitterly.\n\nEndurance travels through the wormhole. The crew first visits Miller’s ocean world, which orbits close to Gargantua and suffers extreme time dilation (one hour equals seven Earth years). A landing party tries to retrieve Dr. Miller’s data but is hit by enormous tidal waves; Doyle dies and the team loses decades relative to Earth. Returning to Endurance they discover 23 years have passed on Earth; Murph is now an adult scientist working with Professor Brand on a gravity equation intended to allow massive stations to lift Earth’s population (Plan A). Brand reveals a contingency Plan B: Endurance carries 5,000 frozen human embryos that would be used to repopulate a chosen world if Plan A fails.\n\nLow on fuel, the crew must pick a final world. Against Amelia’s preference for Edmunds, they choose Mann because Dr. Mann is still transmitting recent data. On Mann’s icy planet they find his transmissions falsified; Mann (who engineered his rescue by faking habitability) attempts to escape when exposed. After Mann sabotages Cooper’s suit and leaves him to die, Cooper survives, Amelia rescues him, and Mann dies during a flawed docking that destroys Endurance’s airlock and much fuel. With insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds conventionally, Cooper and Amelia decide to use Gargantua’s gravity to slingshot Endurance toward Edmunds. TARS and Cooper detach in a sacrifice to reduce mass and attempt to gather data from the black hole’s vicinity.\n\nTARS and Cooper fall into Gargantua and Cooper is ejected into a four-dimensional construct — a tesseract — created by the same future intelligence. Inside, time is represented spatially and Cooper can access multiple moments in Murph’s bedroom. He realizes the “ghost” communications were himself using gravity to send information over time. Cooper uses gravitational manipulation and morse/binary (and TARS’s quantum data on the singularity) to encode the quantum-gravity data onto Murph’s old wristwatch during her childhood, enabling Adult Murph (now Dr. Murphy Cooper) to solve Brand’s equation. With the equation solved, Murph leads Earth’s evacuation on massive habitats; Professor Brand dies without revealing he knew Plan A was impossible without singularity data. After transmitting the data, the tesseract collapses and Cooper is flung back into normal space, where he is recovered near Saturn and awakened aboard Cooper Station, one of the human habitats. He reunites with an elderly Murph on her deathbed. Murph urges Cooper to find Amelia Brand, who traveled alone to Edmunds. The film ends with Cooper stealing a ship and departing to locate Amelia and Case on Edmunds’ planet.",

      "30 years after the events of blade runner, in 2049, replicates-bio engineered humans-remain employed as slave labor. the los angeles police department employs a nexus-9 replicate named k (short for serial number, kd6-3.7) as a \"blade runner,\" an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicate models. after sapper morton retires, k discovers a box at morton's farm, buried beneath a tree. a female replicate who passed away during a cesarean section was buried there. this proves what was previously believed to be impossible-that replicates could reproduce biologically. lt. joshi, k's superior, orders k to retire the replicate child because she believes this information could spark a conflict between humans and replicates. k goes to the wallace corporation, which made replicates and was the tyrell corporation's successor. rachael, an experimental nexus 7 replicate, is identified as the deceased female by dna archives. rachael's romantic relationships with former blade runner rick deckard are revealed to k. in order to increase interstellar colonization, ceo niander wallace is seeking the replication secret. to keep an eye on k, he dispatches luv, his replicate enforcer. k recognizes the date 6.10.21 carved into the tree trunk at morton's farm because it reminds him of a wooden toy horse from his early years. joi, k's holographic a.i. girlfriend, thinks this proves that k was born, not made, because replicate memories are fake. k finds that only the boy is listed as alive in the lapd records, despite the fact that two children born on that date have identical dna except for the sex chromosome. although the records from that year are missing, k finds the child and takes him to an orphanage. k remembers hiding the toy horse in the furnace, and he finds it there after recognizing the orphanage from his memories. k comes to the conclusion that he is rachael's son after replica memory designer dr. ana stelline verifies that his recollection of the orphanage is real. k is then classified as a rogue after failing a baseline test. joshi gives him 48 hours to pass the test or he will be \"retired\" after he suggests to her that he killed the replicate child. in order to have sex with k, joi uses replicate prostitute mariette as a surrogate. the next morning, mariette attaches a tracker to k's jacket before a resentful joi sends her away. k discovers the remains of a radioactive las vegas after analyzing the toy horse. he discovers deckard there, who tells him that he is rachael's child's father and that he jumbled the birth certificates to conceal the identity of their child. the child was left in the care of the replicant freedom movement by deckard. after killing joshi, luv follows k to las vegas. she destroys joi, kidnaps deckard, and abandons a weak k. k is rescued by the replicate freedom movement using mariette's tracker. k concludes that stelline is rachael's daughter and that the toy horse memory belongs to her after their leader, freysa, tells him that rachael had a girl child. freysa begs k to murder deckard because she fears he might hand over stelline or the freedom movement to wallace. luv brings deckard to meet wallace, who offers deckard a replica rachael in return for details regarding the location of his child. when he declines, luv murders the duplicate. k steps in as luv takes deckard to be tortured off-world. he battles luv until he drowns him, but he suffers serious injuries in the process. k takes deckard to stelline's office and gives him her toy horse after staging deckard's death to shield him from wallace and the replicate freedom movement. deckard enters the building and first sees his daughter with tears in his eyes as k passes away on the steps while gazing up at the snow falling."

      "plot_summary": "In 2049 Los Angeles, LAPD blade runner KD6-3.7, called K (a Nexus-9 replicant), locates and 'retires' Nexus-8 Sapper Morton at his farm. While searching Morton's property, K finds a buried box containing the burned remains of a female replicant who died during a cesarean section. Lieutenant Joshi orders K to quietly find and destroy any surviving evidence — specifically the child — because proof that replicants can reproduce would destabilize human society. K submits the corpse's DNA to Wallace Corporation archives; the dead replicant is identified as Rachael, an experimental Nexus-7 who had a relationship with former blade runner Rick Deckard in 2019. Niander Wallace, CEO of Wallace Corporation, wants the reproduction secret to scale off-world colonization and dispatches his enforcer Luv to monitor the case. K notices a carved date (6.10.21) on Morton's tree and recognizes a wooden toy horse from implanted childhood memories; his holographic companion Joi interprets this as possible proof K is human rather than manufactured. K searches LAPD birth and death records for children born that date and discovers a missing record; two children with identical DNA were born that day but one record is missing. K tracks the living child to an orphanage and, confronted with memories and a confirmation test from memory designer Dr. Ana Stelline (who verifies the authenticity of his recalled orphanage memory), initially concludes he is Rachael's child. After failing his baseline test and being declared a rogue, Joshi gives him 48 hours to comply or be retired. K pursues the trail to Las Vegas, using a lead from the toy horse's material and analysis; there he finds Deckard living in isolation. Deckard reveals he was with Rachael and that they had a child in 2021, but he says he swapped or obscured records and left the child with the Replicant Freedom Movement to keep it safe. Meanwhile Wallace, through Luv, kills Joshi to remove LAPD interference and pressures Deckard; Luv later tortures Deckard to force him to reveal the child's location. K is ambushed when Joi, via surrogate Mariette, is used by the Replicant Freedom Movement and by Wallace's forces: Mariette places a tracker on K. K is captured by Wallace's men but rescued by the Freedom Movement led by Freysa, who reveals Rachael's child was a girl and is Dr. Ana Stelline — the child was raised hidden because her memories (implanted and manufactured) were actually real memories from Stelline's life. K realizes he was not the child; his implanted memories were taken from Stelline's childhood. Freysa asks K to kill Deckard to prevent Wallace from using him to find Stelline. Luv captures Deckard and brings him to Wallace, who offers a replica Rachael in exchange for Deckard's cooperation; Deckard refuses and the replica is killed by Luv. K follows and intercepts; he fights Luv on a ship and through to Wallace's facility, eventually killing Luv but sustaining mortal injuries. K stages Deckard's death to hide him and drives Deckard to Dr. Ana Stelline's city-lab in Los Angeles. K gives Deckard the wooden horse that identifies Stelline, then signals the building's elevator so Deckard can meet his daughter. K collapses and dies on the steps outside as Deckard enters Stelline's sterile room and sees her alive for the first time. The film ends with snow falling as Deckard and his daughter reunite and K dies alone, his actions protecting Stelline and keeping the secret from Wallace.",

      "plot_summary": "Industrialist John Hammond opens Jurassic Park, a dinosaur theme park of cloned animals on Isla Nublar. After a Velociraptor handler is killed, Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler, plus chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm and lawyer Donald Gennaro, to certify safety for investors. At the visitor center they see living dinosaurs, learn DNA was recovered from amber and filled with frog DNA, and witness a baby Velociraptor hatch; Dr. Henry Wu admits unauthorized breeding. Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim Murphy join the escorted tour while Hammond monitors from the control room. Dennis Nedry, the park programmer, sabotages the park to steal embryos for a buyer: he disables security and blackouts the park to access the embryo storage, locking the control systems and causing the electric tour cars and paddock fences to fail. During a tropical storm the power outage allows the Tyrannosaurus rex to break out; it overturns a tour vehicle, kills and eats Gennaro, and injures Malcolm. Grant escapes with Lex and Tim into the park interior. Nedry gets lost delivering embryos, crashes, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus. Sattler, Hammond, and the operations team learn Nedry locked the system; chief engineer Ray Arnold and game warden Robert Muldoon try to restore power. Hammond orders a manual reboot; Arnold goes to restore the system but disappears. When Sattler and Muldoon investigate a maintenance shed they encounter Velociraptors freed by the shutdown; Muldoon distracts them and is killed, and Sattler finds Arnold's severed arm. Grant, Lex and Tim discover broken eggs and conclude dinosaurs are breeding because frog DNA allowed sex changes. Grant leads the children to the visitor center while Sattler fights to restart the park. Tim receives a severe jolt from a live fence and Grant resuscitates him with CPR. In the visitor center Lex uses a computer to get the power and security back online; Hammond calls for help. As the group tries to exit they are cornered by Velociraptors in the parking lot kitchen area, but the Tyrannosaurus returns, attacks and kills the raptors, allowing the survivors—Grant, Sattler, Lex, Tim, Hammond and Malcolm—to board Hammond's jeep and then a departing helicopter arranged by Hammond to leave Isla Nublar.",

    "synopsis": [
      "linguist louise banks (amy adams) is caring for her adolescent daughter, who dies of cancer at the age of twelve. louise laments that human beings are bound by time and its linear order, as she relives the memories of her daughter as she was born, grew up and eventually passed away. while she is lecturing at a university, twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear, each landing in a different country. in the ensuing widespread panic, affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them.\nlouise is puzzled about why the aliens sent 12 spacecraft if the objective was to make an initial contact. the craft in us has landed in montana. the president declares a state of emergency, and all air traffic is grounded. panic buying all utilities and groceries ensues. u.s. army colonel weber (forest whitaker) asks louise to join physicist ian donnelly (jeremy renner) (an experimental physicist from los alamos) to decipher their language and find out why they have come to earth. 2 years ago, louise did some farsi interpretation for army intelligence and already has top secret clearance. weber shares an audio file of an interaction with the aliens, but louise says that to interpret their language, she needs to be there and interact directly. the team is brought to a u.s. military camp in montana near one of the spacecrafts and makes contact with two seven-limb aliens on board. the spacecraft itself is oval in shape and stands on its vertical axis. there is an open door at the bottom of the ship, which is accessible via a tall crane. once inside the door, the gravity changes from vertical to horizontal and louise and team are able to walk normally on the \"vertical\" walls inside the chamber. at the end is a glass-like structure beyond which the aliens \"arrive\" to interact with the humans. weber is nervous about louise's approach and wants to know why the aliens came to earth and what are their intentions. louise says that when cook reached australia, he saw a strange animal and asked an aboriginal native what the animal was called. the native said \"kangaroo\" and the name stuck. only kangaroo means \"i don't understand\". she says that it is important to take time and understand the language so that more complex communications are not misinterpreted, later on. louise removes her protective gear in subsequent sessions and interacts more closely with the heptapods.\nthey call the extraterrestrials \"heptapods\", and ian nicknames them abbott and costello. at first the team focuses on the audio cues from the heptapods to try and figure out their language. louise believes that the aliens might have a form of written language.\nlouise shows them a placard with the word \"human\" written on it, and the aliens respond with a written phrase of their own. the writing happens with an ink secreted from their limbs. banks and donnelly research the complex written language of the heptapods, consisting of\npalindromic phrases written with circular symbols, and share the results with other nations. as banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter. when louise asks what the aliens want, they answer: \"offer weapon\". a similar translation \"use weapon\" is made by one of the other sites in china. fear of a potential threat from the aliens leads other nations to close down communications on the project, and some prepare their military for attack. however, louise thinks that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" might have an alternative translation, such as \"tool\" or \"technology\".\nchina's translation likely results from interacting with the heptapods using mahjong, a highly competitive game. rogue u.s. soldiers plant explosives in the spacecraft. unaware, louise and ian re-enter. the aliens give them a much larger and more complex message. abbott ejects ian and louise from the craft as the explosion occurs, which leaves them unconscious. louise and ian come round in the camp as the military prepares to evacuate, and the spacecraft moves higher above the ground. general shang issues an ultimatum to the alien craft in china, demanding that it leave within 24 hours. russia, pakistan, and sudan follow suit; communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in. donnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3d space into which it is projected. banks suggests that the full message is split between the twelve craft and that the heptapods want all the nations to collaborate in order to decipher it. meanwhile, china notifies the world that its military is planning to attack the spacecraft off its coast. louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. she meets costello, who communicates that abbott is dying. louise asks about her visions of a daughter (whom she doesn't recognize), and costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing that her \"visions\" were not flashbacks but flash-forwards.\nlearning the language alters humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience memories of future events. banks's visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future. costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the \"weapon\" or \"tool\" because it changes the mind's perception of time. the aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. they ask her to use her \"weapon\"-her ability to see into the future. banks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells donnelly that the aliens' language is the \"tool\" that was meant by the word \"weapon\".\nshe has a vision of herself at a future united nations reception, being thanked by the chinese general shang (tzi ma) for convincing him to suspend the military attack. he explains that she had called his private mobile telephone. he shows her its number, which he says he knows he must do without understanding why. in the present, louise steals a satellite phone and calls shang but realizes she does not know what to say. her vision continues with shang explaining that she had convinced him by repeating his wife's last words in mandarin, which he tells louise. this convinces shang in present time, and the chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from earth. from what she has learned, banks writes and publishes a book called the universal language, a guide to the heptapod language, which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the heptapods. during the evacuation, donnelly expresses his love for banks. they talk about their life choices and whether he would change them if he could see his life from beginning to end. banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that hannah will die from an incurable disease and that donnelly will leave them both as a result of her revealing that she knew this."

      "plot_summary": "Twelve oval alien spacecraft appear simultaneously at sites around the world; one of them hovers on U.S. military ground in Montana. Linguistics professor Dr. Louise Banks is recruited by Colonel G.T. Weber and brought to the Montana site along with physicist Ian Donnelly to decode the aliens' language and determine their intentions. Inside the craft Louise and Ian meet two seven-limbed heptapods the team nicknames Abbott and Costello. The heptapods communicate by producing large, circular, ink-based logograms. Louise insists on direct, patient interaction rather than relying on recordings, and gradually builds a logographic lexicon linking human concepts to heptapod symbols. As she studies the writing she experiences vivid apparent memories of a daughter named Hannah dying of cancer at age twelve. \n\nThe international project shares early translations; one phrase repeatedly rendered as \"offer weapon\" (later translated elsewhere as \"use weapon\") sparks global fear. China and other nations begin military preparations and cut cooperation between research teams. Louise hypothesizes the heptapod message is split across the twelve ships and that the ambiguous translation of \"weapon\" may mean \"tool\" or \"technology.\" Rogue soldiers plant explosives on the Montana ship; Louise and Ian are inside and are ejected when the device detonates, leaving both briefly unconscious. In the aftermath, General Shang in China issues a 24-hour ultimatum to the craft near his coast. International contacts deteriorate as nations plan attacks. \n\nLouise returns to the ship alone after receiving a shuttle invitation; Costello tells her Abbott is dying. During this session Costello demonstrates that learning the heptapod language restructures human cognition: the script encodes a non-linear perception of time. Louise realizes her visions are not memories but flash-forwards—she will have a daughter, Hannah, who will die young. The heptapods explain they came to give humanity their language (the mistranslated \"weapon\"), a tool that lets humans perceive time nonlinearly; in 3,000 years humans will help the heptapods in return. \n\nArmed with a future memory of convincing General Shang to stand down by reciting his wife's last words in Mandarin, Louise steals a satellite phone, calls Shang, and uses the exact words to persuade him to halt the attack. China calls off the strike, international cooperation resumes, and the twelve ships depart. Ian confesses love for Louise; she chooses to enter the relationship, knowing from her future visions that Hannah will be born and die and that Ian will eventually leave. Louise later publishes a book on the heptapod language, titled The Universal Language, which becomes the basis for humans learning the heptapods' non-linear cognition.",

communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in. donnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3d space into which it is projected. banks suggests that the full message is split between the twelve craft and that the heptapods want all the nations to collaborate in order to decipher it. meanwhile, china notifies the world that its military is planning to attack the spacecraft off its coast. louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. she meets costello, who communicates that abbott is dying. louise asks about her visions of a daughter (whom she doesn't recognize), and costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing that her \"visions\" were not flashbacks but flash-forwards.\nlearning the language alters humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience memories of future events. banks's visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future. costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the \"weapon\" or \"tool\" because it changes the mind's perception of time. the aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. they ask her to use her \"weapon\"-her ability to see into the future. banks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells donnelly that the aliens' language is the \"tool\" that was meant by the word \"weapon\".\nshe has a vision of herself at a future united nations reception, being thanked by the chinese general shang (tzi ma) for convincing him to suspend the military attack. he explains that she had called his private mobile telephone. he shows her its number, which he says he knows he must do without understanding why. in the present, louise steals a satellite phone and calls shang but realizes she does not know what to say. her vision continues with shang explaining that she had convinced him by repeating his wife's last words in mandarin, which he tells louise. this convinces shang in present time, and the chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from earth. from what she has learned, banks writes and publishes a book called the universal language, a guide to the heptapod language, which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the heptapods. during the evacuation, donnelly expresses his love for banks. they talk about their life choices and whether he would change them if he could see his life from beginning to end. banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that hannah will die from an incurable disease and that donnelly will leave them both as a result of her revealing that she knew this."

    "synopsis": [
      "the story begins with the viewer looking out from a window in a workshop to a tree house, then turning and zooming in to a bedroom in a dollhouse that is in the workshop. steve graham wakes his teenage son peter and 13-year-old daughter charlie for their 78-year-old grandmother ellen taper leigh's funeral. steve finds charlie sleeping in the tree house. steve's wife annie, an artist who sculpts miniature dioramas, delivers the eulogy at her mother's service. charlie makes a clucking noise while drawing a strange sketch during the speech. annie talks to charlie about ellen at bedtime that night. charlie claims that her grandmother always wished charlie were a boy. to annie's confusion, charlie also wonders aloud who will care for her now that ellen is dead. annie later sees a haunting vision of ellen after looking through a memory book while in annie's workshop. a bird dies by flying into one of charlie's classroom windows at school. charlie goes outside and cuts off the bird's head. a woman across the street waves at charlie. annie begins researching apparitions. steve receives word from the cemetery that ellen's grave was desecrated, but he decides to not tell his wife. annie tells steve she is going to a movie, but actually attends a grief counseling support group. when she arrives at the meeting it is dark outside. annie openly discloses her mother's mental health issues including the dissociative identity disorder and dementia. charlie sees a strange light in her bedroom. gallery owner silvia archer contacts annie about progress on her new works, which include a piece featuring ellen. peter asks his mother if he can go to a party where he hopes to see bridget, a classmate he is interested in. annie asks peter if he invited his sister to go with him, since he claimed it was a party related to their school. charlie experiences a vision of her grandmother surrounded by fire. charlie makes her clucking noise when she is shaken out of her trance. charlie tells annie that she wants ellen. annie forces peter to take charlie with him to the party. flustered at having to monitor his sister, peter blows off charlie so he can smoke marijuana with bridget and their friends. many of women at the party are wearing long flannel-style shirts. left unsupervised, charlie unknowingly eats chocolate cake containing a substance to which she is allergic. charlie begins choking as she experiences an anaphylactic reaction. peter carries his sister to his car and rushes her toward the hospital along a dark country road. charlie sticks her head out the window in an effort to breathe better. peter swerves to avoid an animal in the road. charlie is decapitated when her head violently hits a utility pole. after sitting and staring in entranced shock, peter drives home in a calm daze. annie comes outside when it is light outside and is horrified to find her daughter's headless body in the car's backseat. the family holds a funeral for charlie. steve looks through charlie's sketchbook of drawings. peter experiences a panic attack while smoking marijuana, before biking home from school. peter arrives at home in the dark. annie grieves alone while sitting in the car in the driveway. annie drives to her grief support group meeting, but decides to turn around while still in the parking lot. it is dark when she arrives. however, before annie can leave, fellow group member joan spots annie and stops her to talk. after hearing about charlie's death, joan confides in annie about the loss of her own child and grandson. when annie returns home, steve makes a pass at her, but annie rebuffs him. annie sleeps in the tree house. peter hears charlie's clucking noise and sees what he thinks is a vision of his dead sister in his room, but it appears to be his own hoodie in the corner. annie visits joan at joan's apartment. annie tells joan about a sleepwalking incident in which she doused peter and charlie and herself from head to toe in paint thinner before waking up to find herself preparing to light a match. from her body language, annie implies that the matches were in her left hand and can of paint thinner in her right. annie explains that her relationships with her children were never the same afterward. steve finds annie constructing a disturbing diorama of the scene where charlie died. steve, annie, and peter have an awkward dinner during which annie blames her son for charlie's death. peter responds by reminding annie that she was the one who forced charlie to go to the party. annie runs into joan at an art supply store. joan excitedly explains to annie that she attended an open séance that changed her skepticism about psychics. joan tells annie that a medium was able to conjure her dead grandson louis and taught joan how to conduct a séance as well.\njoan has a chalkboard in the trunk of her car. joan invites annie over to witness a séance firsthand. joan seemingly makes contact with louis, who uses a glass and a chalkboard to communicate. joan assures annie that she can conduct a similar conjuring herself by using a personal item from the deceased, reciting a cryptic incantation, and making sure that her entire family is in the house during the summoning. annie hears a clucking sound while driving home afterward. annie wakes that night to find a swarm of ants leading to peter's dead body. annie wakes from a sleepwalking trance over her son's bed, prompting a conversation with peter. peter asks why annie is seemingly scared of him. annie involuntarily confesses that she never wanted to be peter's mother and tried to have a miscarriage. annie suddenly wakes to discover she was experiencing a vision within a vision. annie recites joan's incantation with charlie's sketchbook while steve and peter sleep. claiming she summoned charlie, annie excitedly wakes her husband and son for another séance. charlie seemingly possesses annie. steve snaps annie out of her trance by dousing her with water as peter cries from confused fright. during school, peter sees the same strange light that charlie previously saw in her bedroom. peter notices that his reflection looks back at him with a different expression. steve admonishes annie for peter becoming convinced that a vengeful spirit is threatening him. annie trashes her studio in frustration when she accidentally breaks a tiny model chair, after another voicemail from her gallery pressures her about providing new pieces. charlie's spirit supernaturally draws in her old sketchbook. peter sees a vision of his dead sister in the corner, and her head falls off turning into a recreation ball on the floor, before being choked in his bed. peter accuses his mother of sleepwalking and attacking him again. annie advises peter not to tell steve what happened. annie goes on to explain that something supernatural is happening in the house and she is the only one who can stop it. the window above peter's bed has a mark that looks similar to the one in charlie's classroom when struck by the bird. realizing that the spirit she summoned is malevolent, annie throws charlie's sketchbook into the fireplace. annie's arm mirrors the burning book by also catching fire, forcing annie to rescue the book. annie returns to joan for help, but no one's there and she does not go inside joan's residence. the camera shows us joan's place is decked out in witchcraft paraphernalia, including a photo of peter inside a ceremonial triangle and a symbol annie recognizes from family photos. annie learns that the symbol is associated with the demon paimon, one of the kings of hell. annie also finds photos of joan with ellen, revealing that joan and annie's mother were in the same coven devoted to gaining riches by conjuring paimon into a male body. annie discovers ellen's headless corpse in her house's attic. peter hears joan shouting, \"i expel you\" at him from a distance at school behind a fence. during class, peter hears charlie's cluck. peter acts possessed and suddenly bashes his head into his desk, snapping out of his trance with cries of terror and pain. annie stands in the pouring rain below the tree house with ellen's scrapbook, and we see that peter's room behind her in the real house does not exist. steve brings peter home. annie approaches the car, and is dry with no sign of the downpour. annie tells steve that ellen's corpse is in their attic, but it is now decapitated. annie also shows steve the photographs where joan and ellen are wearing the seal of paimon. annie explains that their family became cursed when she tried contacting charlie. annie also explains the connection to charlie's sketchbook, adding that steve needs to destroy it in order to save peter. peter sleeps in his room in the background and is not awakened by the conversation. disbelieving her wild claims, steve accuses annie of digging up ellen's grave. when steve refuses to burn the sketchbook, annie throws it back into the fire, even though she presumes doing so will kill her. instead, steve spontaneously combusts. with his possessed mother hovering in the corner above his bed, peter gets up to search the house. when peter leaves his room the ladder to the attic is withdrawn missing. peter finds his father's charred corpse. possessed, annie chases peter to the attic. the ladder to the attic is now down. annie jumps up and furiously pounds her head on the attic door after peter climbs the ladder and retracts it into the upstairs ceiling. in the attic, peter finds flies, candles, and a photo of his face with the eyes punched out. ellen's body is gone. annie suddenly hovers above peter before severing her own head. confronted by this horror and three undressed devil worshipers, peter jumps out the window. peter's head hits the ground below, which seemingly knocks him out. peter rises after the oddly glowing light seen previously hovers around his body. peter follows his mother's headless corpse as it floats into the tree house. an assembly of mostly devil worshipers in various states of undress greets peter inside the tree house. there is one woman with long hair in a bathrobe. charlie's decapitated head sits atop a statue of paimon. peter looks around with a dazed, flat expression and we're shown annie and ellen's headless bodies lie bowing on the floor, in front of the statue. joan's voice calls peter 'charlie' as a woman crowns him, but welcomes peter as paimon while the coven hails the demon's arrival. the story ends with a shot of a model tree house filled with dolls that look like peter, the coven, and the headless annie and ellen."

      "plot_summary": "At the funeral of 78-year-old Ellen Taper Leigh, Annie Graham (a miniature-diorama artist), her husband Steve, teenage son Peter, and 13-year-old daughter Charlie begin to unravel Ellen's secret life. Charlie, who made strange clucking noises and drew disturbing sketches, tells Annie Ellen always wanted Charlie to be a boy. After Ellen's burial, Annie experiences visions of her mother. At school, a bird flies into Charlie's classroom window and she decapitates it. Joan, a member of Annie's grief support group, later introduces Annie to a séance technique that uses a personal item, an incantation, and the whole family present. Left alone at a party, Charlie unknowingly eats cake containing an allergen, suffers anaphylaxis, and is decapitated when Peter swerves his car to avoid an animal and her head hits a utility pole. The family buries Charlie. Annie begins sleepwalking and exhibiting strange behavior (dousing her family with paint thinner; building a diorama of Charlie's death). Peter experiences panic attacks and visions of Charlie; Annie blames Peter for Charlie's death and then tries Joan's séance method with Charlie's sketchbook to summon her.\nDuring the séance Annie appears possessed; water snaps her out. Supernatural events escalate: Charlie's drawings animate, lights appear in bedrooms, and Peter experiences possession-like episodes at school. Annie discovers Joan's apartment full of witchcraft paraphernalia and photos linking Joan and Ellen in a coven devoted to summoning the demon Paimon into a male host for wealth and power. Annie finds Ellen's corpse—decapitated—in the attic. She confronts Steve and urges him to burn Charlie's sketchbook to save Peter. When Annie throws the book in the fire, Steve spontaneously combusts. Annie becomes fully possessed, pursues Peter through the house, and severs her own head; Peter escapes the attic by jumping out a window, is knocked unconscious, then revived as a glowing light surrounds him.\nPeter follows headless Annie into the tree house where an assembled coven — including Joan and other cultists — crowns him as their new host. They place Charlie's decapitated head atop a statue of Paimon; the coven hails Paimon's arrival and calls Peter 'Charlie' while anointing him as the male vessel. The film ends on a miniature diorama-model tree house containing dolls that represent Peter, the coven, and the headless corpses of Annie and Ellen.",

and taught joan how to conduct a séance as well.\njoan has a chalkboard in the trunk of her car. joan invites annie over to witness a séance firsthand. joan seemingly makes contact with louis, who

him with a different expression. steve admonishes annie for peter becoming convinced that a vengeful spirit is threatening him. annie trashes her studio in frustration when she accidentally breaks a tiny model chair, after another voicemail from her gallery pressures her about providing new pieces. charlie's spirit supernaturally draws in her old sketchbook. peter sees a vision of his dead sister in the corner, and her head falls off turning into a recreation ball on the floor, before being choked in his bed. peter accuses his mother of sleepwalking and attacking him again. annie advises peter not to tell steve what happened. annie goes on to explain that something supernatural is happening in the house and she is the only one who can stop it. the window above peter's bed has a mark that looks similar to the one in charlie's classroom when struck by the bird. realizing that the spirit she summoned is malevolent, annie throws charlie's sketchbook into the fireplace. annie's arm mirrors the burning book by also catching fire, forcing annie to rescue the book. annie returns to joan for help, but no one's there and she does not go inside joan's residence. the camera shows us joan's place is decked out in witchcraft paraphernalia, including a photo of peter inside a ceremonial triangle and a symbol annie recognizes from family photos. annie learns that the symbol is associated with the demon paimon, one of the kings of hell. annie also finds photos of joan with ellen, revealing that joan and annie's mother were in the same coven devoted to gaining riches by conjuring paimon into a male body. annie discovers ellen's headless corpse in her house's attic. peter hears joan shouting, \"i expel you\" at him from a distance at school behind a fence. during class, peter hears charlie's cluck. peter acts possessed and suddenly bashes his head into his desk, snapping out of his trance with cries of terror and pain. annie stands in the pouring rain below the tree house with ellen's scrapbook, and we see that peter's room behind her in the real house does not exist. steve brings peter home. annie approaches the car, and is dry with no sign of the downpour. annie tells steve that ellen's corpse is in their attic, but it is now decapitated. annie also shows steve the photographs where joan and ellen are wearing the seal of paimon. annie explains that their family became cursed when she tried contacting charlie. annie also explains the connection to charlie's sketchbook, adding that steve needs to destroy it in order to save peter. peter sleeps in his room in the background and is not awakened by the conversation. disbelieving her wild claims, steve accuses annie of digging up ellen's grave. when steve refuses to burn the sketchbook, annie throws it back into the fire, even though she presumes doing so will kill her. instead, steve spontaneously combusts. with his possessed mother hovering in the corner above his bed, peter gets up to search the house. when peter leaves his room the ladder to the attic is withdrawn missing. peter finds his father's charred corpse. possessed, annie chases peter to the attic. the ladder to the attic is now down. annie jumps up and furiously pounds her head on the attic door after peter climbs the ladder and retracts it into the upstairs ceiling. in the attic, peter finds flies, candles, and a photo of his face with the eyes punched out. ellen's body is gone. annie suddenly hovers above peter before severing her own head. confronted by this horror and three undressed devil worshipers, peter jumps out the window. peter's head hits the ground below, which seemingly knocks him out. peter rises after the oddly glowing light seen previously hovers around his body. peter follows his mother's headless corpse as it floats into the tree house. an assembly of mostly devil worshipers in various states of undress greets peter inside the tree house. there is one woman with long hair in a bathrobe. charlie's decapitated head sits atop a statue of paimon. peter looks around with a dazed, flat expression and we're shown annie and ellen's headless bodies lie bowing on the floor, in front of the statue. joan's voice calls peter 'charlie' as a woman crowns him, but welcomes peter as paimon while the coven hails the demon's arrival. the story ends with a shot of a model tree house filled with dolls that look like peter, the coven, and the headless annie and ellen."

      "built in 1907, the posh, grand and secluded overlook hotel, located in the mountains of colorado, closes for the winter months as it was never designed as a ski resort, that seclusion and isolation which has always been its attraction for its upscale guests and which makes it largely inaccessible in the snowy winter. having recently moved from vermont to boulder with his wife wendy and their adolescent son danny, former schoolteacher jack torrance has just accepted the five month job as the overlook's winter caretaker in wanting uninterrupted solitude to start his new career as a writer. in accepting the job, jack was not deterred in knowing of the incident ten years ago when the then hotel gm charles grady, acting as that season's winter caretaker, developed a severe case of cabin fever and ended up gruesomely killing his wife and two daughters before killing himself. beyond a recent undiagnosed collapse experienced by danny which may be an issue if it happens again at the hotel, wendy is looking forward to this five month getaway. while danny indirectly states he doesn't want to go, wendy is not concerned about his emotional well being in this new situation as he, out of circumstance, has often been on his own without other children around, which has long ago led to him creating an imaginary friend named tony who lives in danny's mouth. when the torrances arrive at the overlook on october 30th, its last day of operation before they take over for the winter, danny learns that there is someone at the hotel who knows his secret abilities in association to tony's true nature. after the regular staff leaves for the winter and as winter truly sets in, the isolation of the resort begins to show itself. the question becomes which of the often battling powers in this isolation will ultimately come out on top: wendy's mortal fortitude, danny's secret ability which he learns is called the shining, or the hotel's associated secrets which are slowly overtaking jack.",

    "synopsis": [
      "former teacher and recovering alcoholic jack torrance ( jack nicholson ) interviews for a caretaker job at the overlook hotel in an effort to rebuild his life after his volatile temper lost him his teaching position. the hotel manager, mr. stuart ullman ( barry nelson ), warns jack that he and his family will be snowbound through most of the winter and of the potential risk for cabin fever. he drives the point home by recounting a season when the caretaker, charles grady, went crazy and brutaly killed his wife, his two girls ( lisa burns and louise burns ), and finally himself. given his own desperation and the opportunity to pursue his true passion, writing, jack acknowledges the warning, but accepts the job. meanwhile, jack's son danny ( danny lloyd ) has a seizure while talking to his imaginary friend tony about the overlook hotel. he has a vision of blood splashing out of an elevator in the hotel, an image which is revisited several times throughout the film. upon danny's arrival at the hotel, head chef dick hallorann ( scatman crothers ) recognizes that danny is telepathic, and speaks to him mentally to offer him some ice cream. he explains that he and his grandmother both had the gift; she referred to this communication as \"shining.\" he also counsels danny about the hotel, hinting that something terrible had happened there and left a trace, \"as if someone burned toast,\" which only people who can \"shine\" will perceive. danny questions dick about what went on in the hotel, and about room 237 in particular as danny can sense that dick is especially afraid of that room. though he strives to assure danny that the images he sees in the hotel are just 'like pictures in a book' and can't hurt him, dick sternly warns danny to stay out of that room. jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly once the family is alone in the hotel. he has writer's block, sleeps too little, and is irritable. danny has visions of the two murdered grady girls, but tells no one. he continues to wonder about room 237. while the weather is still relatively warm, jack's wife wendy ( shelley duvall ) and danny walk through a maze of tall hedges, making a game out of it, stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes. jack looks through a maze model sculpture inside the room of the maze hedge and can see wendy and danny inside the maze. one day, a ball rolls toward danny as he plays with his toys. it appears to have come from the open door of room 237, which danny enters. at that moment, wendy comes running from the basement at the sound of jack's screams in the lounge. he tells her that he had a nightmare in which he used an axe to chop danny and her to pieces. as a disconcerted wendy promises that 'everything's gonna be okay,' danny appears at the other end of the room, looking disoriented and sucking his thumb. his sweater is ripped and there are bruises on his neck. he does not answer when wendy asks what happened. she angrily accuses jack of hurting danny and takes the child back to their suite. jack is furious about the accusation. he storms around the hotel, making his way to the gold ballroom. sinking defeatedly onto a stool at an empty bar, his head in his hands, jack declares that he would sell his soul for one drink. when he looks up he discovers a bartender ( joe turkel ), who serves him a drink. jack is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of the bartender and even addresses him by his name, lloyd. in the course of telling his troubles to lloyd, jack reveals that he unintentionally dislocated danny's shoulder, the same accident wendy mentioned to danny's pediatrician earlier. notably, jack states that the injury happened three years ago, while in explaining the same story to the pediatrician, wendy said that jack, who vowed to quit drinking immediately following the accident, has currently been sober for only five months. a frantic wendy enters, finding jack seemingly alone at the bar; she pleads with him to investigate danny's claim that \"a crazy woman\" attacked him in the bathtub of room 237. jack, who acts a bit tipsy, grudgingly agrees to go have a look. as jack approaches the door to room 237, danny appears to be having a seizure in his own room. dick, back at his home in florida, stares wide-eyed as he picks up on a signal danny is sending. jack cautiously enters room 237. the bedroom is empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. he watches lustfully as a young, beautiful, naked woman ( lia beldam ) pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly out of the bathtub. the two approach each other and embrace in a passionate kiss. jack catches a glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse. he recoils in horror-- the young lady standing before him has transformed into an elderly woman ( billie gibson ); a walking corpse with rotten, sagging skin. she cackles madly while reaching for him with outstretched arms. stunned, jack staggers out of the room, locking the door after him. when he reports back to wendy, jack denies anything amiss in room 237. wendy suggests they take danny to a doctor. jack becomes irate, lecturing wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming her for everything that's gone wrong in his life. insisting that they can't leave the hotel because of his obligation to his employers, he storms out, returning to the gold room, which is now the scene of an extravagant party with guests dressed in 1920's fashion. lloyd serves him a drink and jack strolls through the crowd. he doesn't get far when a butler carrying a tray runs into him, spilling advocaat on his jacket. the butler convinces jack to come into the bathroom to clean up. the butler introduces himself as delbert grady ( philip stone ). jack remembers the story mr. ullman told him about a former caretaker named grady murdering his family and confronts grady with the information. grady denies that anything of the sort took place and furthermore insists that jack has 'always been the caretaker.' jack is confused, but seems to accept grady's story. grady goes on to tell jack that danny has 'a great talent' and is using it to bring an 'outside party' into the situation, referring to dick halloran with a racial slur. grady advises jack on how to \"correct\" danny, and how to deal with wendy if she interferes. back in florida, dick has had no luck contacting the people at the overlook hotel. worried about danny, he books the next flight to colorado. at the overlook, wendy arms herself with a baseball bat and looks for jack, intent on leaving the hotel with danny whether or not jack agrees to come. entering the lounge, she spots jack's manuscript left unattended next to the typewriter. she reads what jack has been writing: hundreds of pages of repetitions of a single sentence: 'all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.' she realizes that jack has gone mad. jack approaches from behind and asks her sarcastically, how she likes it. wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face him. a confrontation ensues as jack demands to know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel with danny, while wendy retreats, brandishing the bat. she screams at jack not to hurt her, and he swears that he will not; instead, he intends to kill her. wendy hits jack on the head with the bat at the top of a flight of stairs, causing him to lose his balance and tumble down the staircase, injuring his ankle in the process. wendy drags jack's limp body to the pantry and locks him inside, just as he regains consciousness. jack tells her he has sabotaged the radio, as well as the snow cat, stranding them all there. she goes outside to check on the snow cat, and confirms what he told her. a few hours later, jack is roused from a nap by the sound of delbert grady's voice. grady expresses disappointment and a lack of confidence in jack, but jack assures him he can get the job done if given one more chance. the pantry door then suddenly unlocks. wendy has fallen asleep in her room. danny is in a trance, carrying a knife and muttering 'redrum' repeatedly. he takes wendy's lipstick and writes 'redrum' on the bathroom door. he begins shouting 'redrum,' which wakes wendy. she clutches him to her, then sees the reflection of the bathroom door in the mirror. reversed, it reads: 'murder.' at that instant, banging sounds start coming from the door to the hallway. the sound is jack swinging an axe at the locked door. wendy grabs danny and locks them in the bathroom. she opens a tiny, snow banked window and pushes danny out; he slides safely to the ground. she tries to get out the same window, but cannot fit. she tells danny to run and hide. meanwhile, jack has chopped his way through the front door and calls out that he is home. jack then knocks politely on the bathroom door. wendy holds the knife and tries to steady herself as jack begins chopping into the door. after chopping away one of the panels, he sticks his head through. jack sticks his hand through the door to turn the lock. wendy slashes at him with a knife, cutting jack's hand and sending him recoiling in pain. jack continues to hack at the door with the axe until they both hear the low rumble of an approaching snow cat engine. he stalks out. the snow cat driver is dick. inside the hotel, he calls out, but gets no reply. jack, hiding behind a pillar, leaps out and swings the axe into dick's chest, killing him. danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet, screams, revealing his location. he clambers out of the steel cabinet and runs outside. meanwhile, wendy has ventured from the bathroom and begun to search for danny. the hotel has sprung to life and now even wendy encounters its ghosts, sights that shock and horrify her. at the same time, axe-wielding jack turns on the outdoor lights and follows danny into the hedge maze. danny realizes he is leaving a trail of footprints in the snow for jack to follow. he carefully retraces his steps, walking backwards in the same prints he'd just created in the opposite direction, then covers the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge. when jack arrives, he sees that the trail of footprints ends abruptly, giving him no clue as to which direction danny took. he chooses a path and lurches deeper into the maze. danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows his own footprints back to the maze's entrance. wendy makes her way out of the hotel just as danny emerges from the maze. relieved, she flings down the knife and embraces him. jack bellows his frustration from within the maze. danny and wendy waste no time escaping in the snow cat that dick used to get to the hotel. jack, hopelessly lost in the maze, freezes to death. right before the end credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old photographs that chronicle the hotel's history. an old recording of 'midnight, the stars and you' echoes in the empty hallway. in the center of one picture is a young jack. the caption reads, 'overlook hotel, july 4th ball, 1921.'"

      "plot_summary": "Jack Torrance, a recovering alcoholic and former teacher, interviews with Stuart Ullman at the Overlook Hotel in Colorado and accepts the winter caretaker job to write and rebuild his life. He moves in with his wife Wendy and son Danny on October 30th. Ullman warns of the hotel's history, recounting ten years earlier when caretaker Charles Grady murdered his family and himself. Danny, who has psychic abilities called \"the shining,\" experiences a seizure and visions of bloody elevators and the hotel’s violent past. Head chef Dick Hallorann recognizes Danny's gift, telepathically comforts him, and warns Danny to avoid Room 237. After the seasonal staff leaves and snow isolates the family, Jack suffers writer's block, irritability, and sleep disturbance. Danny continues to see ghosts (including the Grady girls) and senses danger around Room 237; a ball rolls out of that room and Danny later emerges bruised and frightened, claiming a woman attacked him in the bathtub. Jack begins hearing voices and hallucinating; in the empty Gold Room he meets a spectral bartender named Lloyd and attends a lavish 1920s party whose guests include Delbert/Delbert Grady, who insists Jack has always been the caretaker and urges him to \"correct\" Danny and deal with Wendy. Jack denies the corpse-woman he sees in Room 237 when Wendy presses him, grows contemptuous of Wendy's concern, and lashes out verbally. Wendy finds Jack's manuscript pages and discovers he has typed the same sentence repeatedly—\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\"—revealing his descent into madness. Jack attacks Wendy; she incapacitates him, locks him in the pantry, and discovers he has sabotaged the radio and the snowcat, stranding them. Danny, influenced by Tony (his imaginary friend and a facet of his shining), writes \"REDRUM\" on a door and starts chanting it. Jack breaks out of the pantry, swings an axe and ultimately chops through the bathroom door where Wendy and Danny hide; Wendy pushes Danny through a small window into the snow and tells him to run and hide. Dick Hallorann, feeling Danny's distress from Florida, flies to the Overlook in the snowcat, but when he enters Jack ambushes and kills him with an axe. Danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet, screams and flees outside. Jack pursues Danny into the hotel's hedge maze, punctuated by supernatural activity attacking Wendy inside the hotel. Danny deliberately retraces his footprints backwards and hides; Jack becomes lost in the maze, freezes to death, and is found by Wendy and Danny who escape in the snowcat. The film closes on the Overlook's photo gallery: a 1921 photograph shows Jack among the hotel’s past attendees, implying the hotel has absorbed him into its history.",

      "former teacher and recovering alcoholic jack torrance ( jack nicholson ) interviews for a caretaker job at the overlook hotel in an effort to rebuild his life after his volatile temper lost him his teaching position. the hotel manager, mr. stuart ullman ( barry nelson ), warns jack that he and his family will be snowbound through most of the winter and of the potential risk for cabin fever. he drives the point home by recounting a season when the caretaker, charles grady, went crazy and brutaly killed his wife, his two girls ( lisa burns and louise burns ), and finally himself. given his own desperation and the opportunity to pursue his true passion, writing, jack acknowledges the warning, but accepts the job. meanwhile, jack's son danny ( danny lloyd ) has a seizure while talking to his imaginary friend tony about the overlook hotel. he has a vision of blood splashing out of an elevator in the hotel, an image which is revisited several times throughout the film. upon danny's arrival at the hotel, head chef dick hallorann ( scatman crothers ) recognizes that danny is telepathic, and speaks to him mentally to offer him some ice cream. he explains that he and his grandmother both had the gift; she referred to this communication as \"shining.\" he also counsels danny about the hotel, hinting that something terrible had happened there and left a trace, \"as if someone burned toast,\" which only people who can \"shine\" will perceive. danny questions dick about what went on in the hotel, and about room 237 in particular as danny can sense that dick is especially afraid of that room. though he strives to assure danny that the images he sees in the hotel are just 'like pictures in a book' and can't hurt him, dick sternly warns danny to stay out of that room. jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly once the family is alone in the hotel. he has writer's block, sleeps too little, and is irritable. danny has visions of the two murdered grady girls, but tells no one. he continues to wonder about room 237. while the weather is still relatively warm, jack's wife wendy ( shelley duvall ) and danny walk through a maze of tall hedges, making a game out of it, stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes. jack looks through a maze model sculpture inside the room of the maze hedge and can see wendy and danny inside the maze. one day, a ball rolls toward danny as he plays with his toys. it appears to have come from the open door of room 237, which danny enters. at that moment, wendy comes running from the basement at the sound of jack's screams in the lounge. he tells her that he had a nightmare in which he used an axe to chop danny and her to pieces. as a disconcerted wendy promises that 'everything's gonna be okay,' danny appears at the other end of the room, looking disoriented and sucking his thumb. his sweater is ripped and there are bruises on his neck. he does not answer when wendy asks what happened. she angrily accuses jack of hurting danny and takes the child back to their suite. jack is furious about the accusation. he storms around the hotel, making his way to the gold ballroom. sinking defeatedly onto a stool at an empty bar, his head in his hands, jack declares that he would sell his soul for one drink. when he looks up he discovers a bartender ( joe turkel ), who serves him a drink. jack is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of the bartender and even addresses him by his name, lloyd. in the course of telling his troubles to lloyd, jack reveals that he unintentionally dislocated danny's shoulder, the same accident wendy mentioned to danny's pediatrician earlier. notably, jack states that the injury happened three years ago, while in explaining the same story to the pediatrician, wendy said that jack, who vowed to quit drinking immediately following the accident, has currently been sober for only five months. a frantic wendy enters, finding jack seemingly alone at the bar; she pleads with him to investigate danny's claim that \"a crazy woman\" attacked him in the bathtub of room 237. jack, who acts a bit tipsy, grudgingly agrees to go have a look. as jack approaches the door to room 237, danny appears to be having a seizure in his own room. dick, back at his home in florida, stares wide-eyed as he picks up on a signal danny is sending. jack cautiously enters room 237. the bedroom is empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. he watches lustfully as a young, beautiful, naked woman ( lia beldam ) pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly out of the bathtub. the two approach each other and embrace in a passionate kiss. jack catches a glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse. he recoils in horror-- the young lady standing before him has transformed into an elderly woman ( billie gibson ); a walking corpse with rotten, sagging skin. she cackles madly while reaching for him with outstretched arms. stunned, jack staggers out of the room, locking the door after him. when he reports back to wendy, jack denies anything amiss in room 237. wendy suggests they take danny to a doctor. jack becomes irate, lecturing wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming her for everything that's gone wrong in his life. insisting that they can't leave the hotel because of his obligation to his employers, he storms out, returning to the gold room, which is now the scene of an extravagant party with guests dressed in 1920's fashion. lloyd serves him a drink and jack strolls through the crowd. he doesn't get far when a butler carrying a tray runs into him, spilling advocaat on his jacket. the butler convinces jack to come into the bathroom to clean up. the butler introduces himself as delbert grady ( philip stone ). jack remembers the story mr. ullman told him about a former caretaker named grady murdering his family and confronts grady with the information. grady denies that anything of the sort took place and furthermore insists that jack has 'always been the caretaker.' jack is confused, but seems to accept grady's story. grady goes on to tell jack that danny has 'a great talent' and is using it to bring an 'outside party' into the situation, referring to dick halloran with a racial slur. grady advises jack on how to \"correct\" danny, and how to deal with wendy if she interferes. back in florida, dick has had no luck contacting the people at the overlook hotel. worried about danny, he books the next flight to colorado. at the overlook, wendy arms herself with a baseball bat and looks for jack, intent on leaving the hotel with danny whether or not jack agrees to come. entering the lounge, she spots jack's manuscript left unattended next to the typewriter. she reads what jack has been writing: hundreds of pages of repetitions of a single sentence: 'all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.' she realizes that jack has gone mad. jack approaches from behind and asks her sarcastically, how she likes it. wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face him. a confrontation ensues as jack demands to know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel with danny, while wendy retreats, brandishing the bat. she screams at jack not to hurt her, and he swears that he will not;

he slides safely to the ground. she tries to get out the same window, but cannot fit. she tells danny to run and hide. meanwhile, jack has chopped his way through the front door and calls out that he is home. jack then knocks politely on the bathroom door. wendy holds the knife and tries to steady herself as jack begins chopping into the door. after chopping away one of the panels, he sticks his head through. jack sticks his hand through the door to turn the lock. wendy slashes at him with a knife, cutting jack's hand and sending him recoiling in pain. jack continues to hack at the door with the axe until they both hear the low rumble of an approaching snow cat engine. he stalks out. the snow cat driver is dick. inside the hotel, he calls out, but gets no reply. jack, hiding behind a pillar, leaps out and swings the axe into dick's chest, killing him. danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet, screams, revealing his location. he clambers out of the steel cabinet and runs outside. meanwhile, wendy has ventured from the bathroom and begun to search for danny. the hotel has sprung to life and now even wendy encounters its ghosts, sights that shock and horrify her. at the same time, axe-wielding jack turns on the outdoor lights and follows danny into the hedge maze. danny realizes he is leaving a trail of footprints in the snow for jack to follow. he carefully retraces his steps, walking backwards in the same prints he'd just created in the opposite direction, then covers the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge. when jack arrives, he sees that the trail of footprints ends abruptly, giving him no clue as to which direction danny took. he chooses a path and lurches deeper into the maze. danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows his own footprints back to the maze's entrance. wendy makes her way out of the hotel just as danny emerges from the maze. relieved, she flings down the knife and embraces him. jack bellows his frustration from within the maze. danny and wendy waste no time escaping in the snow cat that dick used to get to the hotel. jack, hopelessly lost in the maze, freezes to death. right before the end credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old photographs that chronicle the hotel's history. an old recording of 'midnight, the stars and you' echoes in the empty hallway. in the center of one picture is a young jack. the caption reads, 'overlook hotel, july 4th ball, 1921.'"

      "after landing a job as an off-season caretaker, jack torrance, an aspiring author and recovering alcoholic, drags his wife wendy and gifted son danny to snow-covered colorado's secluded overlook hotel. however, writer's block prevents jack from pursuing a new writing career. everything has its time, however. first, the manager must give jack a grand tour. then, mr hallorann, the facility's aging chef, chats with danny about rare psychic gifts. the mysterious employee also warns the boy about the cavernous hotel's abandoned rooms. room 237, especially, is off-limits. that's all very well, but jack is gradually losing his mind. after all, strange occurrences and blood-chilling visions have trapped the family in a silent gargantuan prison hammered by endless snowstorms. and now, incessant voices inside jack's head demand sacrifice. however, is jack capable of murder?",
      "built in 1907, the posh, grand and secluded overlook hotel, located in the mountains of colorado, closes for the winter months as it was never designed as a ski resort, that seclusion and isolation which has always been its attraction for its upscale guests and which makes it largely inaccessible in the snowy winter. having recently moved from vermont to boulder with his wife wendy and their adolescent son danny, former schoolteacher jack torrance has just accepted the five month job as the overlook's winter caretaker in wanting uninterrupted solitude to start his new career as a writer. in accepting the job, jack was not deterred in knowing of the incident ten years ago when the then hotel gm charles grady, acting as that season's winter caretaker, developed a severe case of cabin fever and ended up gruesomely killing his wife and two daughters before killing himself. beyond a recent undiagnosed collapse experienced by danny which may be an issue if it happens again at the hotel, wendy is looking forward to this five month getaway. while danny indirectly states he doesn't want to go, wendy is not concerned about his emotional well being in this new situation as he, out of circumstance, has often been on his own without other children around, which has long ago led to him creating an imaginary friend named tony who lives in danny's mouth. when the torrances arrive at the overlook on october 30th, its last day of operation before they take over for the winter, danny learns that there is someone at the hotel who knows his secret abilities in association to tony's true nature. after the regular staff leaves for the winter and as winter truly sets in, the isolation of the resort begins to show itself. the question becomes which of the often battling powers in this isolation will ultimately come out on top: wendy's mortal fortitude, danny's secret ability which he learns is called the shining, or the hotel's associated secrets which are slowly overtaking jack.",
      "the wannabe writer jack torrance travels to the overlook hotel to be interviewed by the manager stuart ullman about a job position. jack is a candidate to work as caretaker of the hotel over the winter, and ullman warns him about the cabin fever since his family will be isolated for five months. ten years ago, the caretaker charles grady murdered his wife, his two daughters and himself with an ax affected by the isolation. on the day the hotel is closed, jack arrives with his wife wendy torrance and son danny and while ullman shows the hotel to jack and wendy, the chief of the kitchen dick hallorann entertains danny. he explains to danny that they are shining, meaning they have premonition and telepathic abilities. during the winter, danny sees weird events at the hotel and jack works hard on his novel. until the day danny is wounded by a woman in room 237 that tries to strangle him and wendy discovers that jack is insane.",
      "jack torrance becomes caretaker of the isolated overlook hotel during winter, bringing his family. the hotel's supernatural forces exploit jack's mental instability, leading to violence and terror. son danny possesses psychic \"shining\" abilities, sensing the hotel's malevolence. the film blends horror, psychological drama, and suspense, exploring isolation, madness, family dynamics, and the destructive potential of unaddressed trauma."

    "synopsis": [
      "at the beginning of the film, a shadowy old woman is seen inside a house while the inhabitants sleep.\nrenai and josh lambert have recently moved into a new home with their three children. one morning, renai looks through a family photo album with her son, dalton, who asks why there are no pictures of josh when he was a child. renai reasons that he has always been camera shy and disliked taking photos of himself. one evening, dalton sees the attic door open and goes to investigate after hearing sounds upstairs. as he enters inside, he tries to climb a ladder to turn on the light, but falls when the ladder cracks. as he falls to the floor, he seems to stare in horror at the darkness as if looking at something terrifying. shaken, he is put to bed by renai and josh and told not to play in the attic because it is off-limits. the next day, dalton does not awaken from his sleep. renai and josh rush him to the hospital, where the doctors say he is in an inexplicable coma. three months later, dalton is moved back to his home while still in a coma. shortly after, disturbing events begin to occur. the first is when renai hears a voice on the baby monitor which shouts \"i want it now!\", a bloody hand-print on dalton's bed and a strange but frightening man in her infant daughter's bedroom. renai becomes more disturbed when their youngest son, foster, says he does not like it when dalton \"walks around\" at night. renai tells josh about the events, but when she is assaulted by the strange man that night, she begs josh and the family soon moves to another house. in the new house, the supernatural events continue to occur, such as a strange, dancing boy, and soon become increasingly sinister. lorraine, josh's mother, recalls having a strange dream of going inside dalton's room in the night and seeing something standing in the corner, and when questioned \"what do you want?\", it replies \"dalton.\" subsequently lorraine sees a red-faced figure standing behind josh that roars at her and dalton is then violently attacked in his bedroom. this prompts lorraine to contact a friend, elise reiner, who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity. the family, elise, and her team enter dalton's room and elise sees and describes a figure to one of her two assistants, who draws a black figure with a red face and dark hollow eyes on the ceiling of dalton's room; the same figure that lorraine had seen before in the house. elise explains to renai and josh that dalton has the ability to astral project while sleeping and that he has been doing it since he was very young. the reason that dalton is in a comatose state is because he has fearlessly traveled too far into different spiritual worlds (he believes the projections are dreams) and has consequently become lost in a land called \"the further\", a place for the tormented souls of the dead. while dalton's spirit is in this other world, he has left nothing but a lifeless body. the tormented souls crave another chance at life through dalton's state, while there are others (possibly the old woman and the frightening man) who are more malicious in using him, and then there is the red-faced figure, revealed to be a demon, who wants to use dalton for a more malicious intent. however, for a spirit to consume a body, a period of time and energy are required. skeptical at first, josh later relents when he discovers dalton had been drawing pictures which resemble the demonic figure elise described. they run a session to try to communicate with their son but dalton appears and the demon uses dalton's body to fight the group, along with other entities who want dalton's body. after the session, elise calls lorraine and the two reveal to the couple that josh also can astral project and was terrorized by an evil spirit during his childhood. lorraine shows them pictures from josh's childhood, revealing a shadowy old woman (the same woman from the beginning of the film) behind him. the more photographs taken of josh, the closer the shadowy woman begins to get to josh until she is inches away from him, explaining his fear of photos. elise suggests that josh should use his ability to find and help return dalton's soul, to which josh agrees. to prepare to astral-project and find his son, elise sits him in a chair and places him in a trance. josh suddenly awakes to find that he has astral-projected seeing his own self asleep in the chair as well as the others in the room. he proceeds outside in a misty emptiness in an attempt to find his way to dalton. after encountering a boy who points him back towards a house (the same home that the lamberts moved out of), he proceeds, only to encounter a family who is shot by a bizarre, smiling female member of the family in the living room. startled, josh makes his way to the attic where he discovers a red door (the same one drawn in dalton's pictures). before he can enter, the violent man seen by renai in their daughter's room appears and attacks him. once defeating him, josh enters the red door. inside is \"the further\" and the red-faced demon's lair. while entering a cavernous red room, josh discovers a sobbing dalton, chained to the floor. josh frees his son, but the demon has discovered josh's presence and attacks them. in search of their physical bodies, josh and dalton flee the demon's lair, with the demon in pursuit. just before the two awaken, josh leaves his son to confront the shadowy old woman who appears to be inside his house. as he shouts for her to get away from him, screaming that he isn't afraid of her, she retreats into the darkness. moments later, josh and dalton both awaken, just as all the spirits vanish. with the family now happily reunited, renai, dalton, and lorraine chat in the kitchen as elise and josh pack up from the long night. josh hands elise the pictures from his childhood, and as she takes them from his hands, she senses something and takes a picture of josh. he promptly goes into a rage, screaming that she knows that he doesn't like to get photographed, and leaps on her before strangling her to death. renai hears josh yelling and goes into the room to find elise dead and josh gone. she searches for josh and finds everyone is gone, the house dead silent. she looks and comes across elise's camera, seeing a picture in it of the shadowy old woman. it's revealed that what elise saw was josh's old and dirty hand and nails, similar to the old woman's, implying that she has possessed him. josh then puts his hand on renai's shoulder, saying \"renai, i'm right here,\" and horror envelops her face as she looks behind her. in a post-credits scene, the shadowy, old woman can be seen blowing out a candle and the screen fades into total darkness."

      "plot_summary": "Renai and Josh Lambert move with their three children—Dalton, Foster, and a baby daughter—into a new house. Dalton falls through an attic ladder, appears to stare into something terrifying, and the next morning is found in a mysterious coma. Doctors cannot explain it; after three months Dalton is brought home. Strange phenomena begin: a voice on the baby monitor shouting \"I want it now!\", a bloody handprint on Dalton's bed, a frightening man seen in the baby girl's room, and Foster saying Dalton \"walks around\" at night. The family moves to a different house but the disturbances follow and escalate. Lorraine (Josh's mother) dreams of a figure answering \"Dalton\" and later sees a red-faced figure behind Josh; Dalton is violently attacked in his bedroom. Lorraine contacts paranormal investigator Elise Rainier. Elise and her team visit Dalton's room; Elise recognizes a black figure with a red face and hollow eyes and explains to Renai and Josh that Dalton has been astral projecting since childhood and is lost in a spirit realm called \"the Further,\" leaving his body vulnerable to malevolent spirits that want to possess it. Elise reveals that for a spirit to take a body it needs time and energy; some entities are trying to possess Dalton while a powerful red-faced demon has a more malign purpose. During a séance Dalton briefly appears and the demon and other entities use Dalton's body to lash out, prompting Elise to tell the Lamperts that Josh can also astral project and was terrorized as a child. Lorraine produces Josh's childhood photos showing a shadowy old woman looming closer in each picture—this explains Josh's lifelong fear of photographs. Josh agrees to astral-project to find Dalton. Elise induces a trance; Josh's spirit leaves his sleeping body and travels through a misty, empty landscape that mirrors the Further. He encounters a boy who points him toward a specific house (their old home), then witnesses a bizarre family scene where a smiling female shoots family members. Josh finds the attic and a blood-red door (the one Dalton had drawn). Attacked by the violent man seen in the waking world, Josh defeats him and enters the red door into the Further. Inside Josh finds a cavernous red lair where Dalton is chained and sobbing. Josh frees Dalton, but the red-faced demon discovers them and pursues them toward their bodies. As they flee, Josh chooses to confront the shadowy old woman near his sleeping body. He screams that he's not afraid; the old woman retreats. Josh and Dalton wake in their physical bodies and the spirits vanish. The family briefly reunites; Elise prepares to leave with photographs from Josh's childhood. Elise impulsively takes a photo of Josh; he suddenly becomes violent, strangles Elise to death, and disappears. Renai finds Elise dead and Elise's camera contains a photo of the shadowy old woman. Josh, now possessed by the old woman (his hands revealed to be filthy and old), returns and places his hand on Renai's shoulder, saying \"Renai, I'm right here.\" The film ends with Renai's horror as the possessed Josh stands behind her; in a post-credits shot the shadowy old woman blows out a candle and the screen goes dark.",

      "plot_summary": "After Sienna Shaw decapitates Art the Clown, his headless body kills a responding cop and is transported to an asylum where Victoria Heyes—now possessed by the Little Pale Girl—has just given birth to Art's severed head. The newly reunited Art and Victoria kill a nurse and a guard and flee to an abandoned house. Victoria slashes her wrists in a bathroom and goes into a dormant, hibernation-like state in a bathtub while Art sits in the attic; both become dormant. Five years later Sienna is released from a mental health facility and moves in with her aunt Jess, Jess's husband Greg, and their daughter Gabbie in Miles County. Sienna suffers survivor guilt and hallucinations of her dead friend Brooke; her younger brother Jonathan is in college and trying to move on. Two demolition workers discover the abandoned house, waking Art and Victoria. They kill the workers; Victoria begins making a costume while Art goes on a new killing spree. Art kills a bar bartender and patron, steals a Santa costume, murders a family while impersonating Santa, and later poses as Santa at a shopping mall where he uses explosive “gifts” to slaughter multiple shoppers, including children. Sienna briefly thinks she sees Art at the mall but does not tell her family. At Jonathan's university, Sienna meets his roommate Cole and Cole's girlfriend Mia (a true-crime podcaster); Mia pressures them into an interview. Art attacks the university, killing Mia and Cole with a chainsaw in the showers. News of the mall massacre reaches Sienna; she demands Jonathan come home. Greg goes to fetch Jonathan. While Sienna sleeps she dreams of angels forging a warrior costume her father had drawn for her; when she wakes she finds Jess and Greg brutally assaulted. Art and Victoria—Victoria now in a clown costume—have invaded the house. Art incapacitates Sienna with a mallet. Sienna regains consciousness to find Greg decapitated and his head used as the star on their Christmas tree; Jess is tied up and later killed by Art by forcing rats down a tube into her mouth and slitting her throat. Victoria shows Sienna a skinless head being consumed by rats and claims it is Gabbie's; Victoria reveals she has taken Jonathan's head. Victoria crowns Sienna with a crown of thorns and attempts to possess her, but Sienna resists. Sienna deceives them into letting her open a wrapped “present,” uses her father's sword from the Terrifier attraction, stabs Victoria and decapitates her; Victoria's body disintegrates. As Art attacks with a chainsaw, Victoria's blood burns through the floor and opens a portal to hell. Gabbie falls toward the abyss and clings to the edge; Sienna leaves Art momentarily to save her but Gabbie falls into the portal, taking the sword with her. Art escapes through a window and flees on a bus. Sienna's wounds supernaturally heal; she vows to find and rescue Gabbie and to hunt Art down.",

    "synopsis": [
      "the film begins with photographer adam faulkner (leigh whannell) waking up in a bathtub filled with water. in his instinctive flailing, his foot catches and removes its plug; as the water drains a glowing blue object can be briefly seen to be washed away with it. after a few cries for help it is revealed that he is not, in fact, alone. surgeon dr. lawrence gordon (cary elwes) is on the other side of the same room, and soon finds the switch to turn on the lights. both men are inside a grimy, dilapidated industrial bathroom, chained to pipes at opposite corners of the room. between them, out of their reach, is a body lying in a pool of blood, holding a revolver and a micro-cassette recorder. both men discover envelopes in their pockets which contain micro-tapes; gordon also holds a bullet and a key that does not unlock their shackles. adam, with lawrence's help, manages to snag the player from the body with which they play their tapes. both tapes have the same voice, distorted by a pitch modulator. adam's tape refers to him as a voyeur and asks, \"are you going to watch yourself die, or do something about it?\" gordon's tape reveals he must kill adam before six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will die and he will be left in the bathroom, presumably forever. hacksaws are soon discovered in the toilet tank; neither is sufficiently sharp to cut chain, and adam accidentally snaps his in frustration. dr. gordon realizes that the saws are meant instead for their own ankles, which, if sawed through, would free them from their shackles. the film then presents flashbacks of their captor's previous victims: paul and mark. both men failed to escape, and hence had pieces of skin cut from them in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece; thus, the genesis for referring to him as the \"jigsaw killer\" by the detectives tapp (danny glover), sing (ken leung) and kerry (dina meyer) who investigate the murders. back in the bathroom, dr. gordon comments that this is a misnomer, as he never directly murders his victims nor places them in situations where death is unavoidable. in yet another flashback we are shown the police interrogation (with dr. gordon witnessing behind a window) of jigsaw's only known survivor, a highly traumatized heroin addict named amanda young (shawnee smith), who believes that her experience in the test has made her a better person in the end. after a brief sequence where adam and dr. gordon discover a hidden camera, another flashback sequence shows gordon's last moments with his family, and their subsequent abduction. another flashback shows an attempt by tapp and sing illegally breaking and entering into what turns out to be one of jigsaw's lairs. the two discover a man tied to a chair with two drills mounted on each side. before the detectives can secure jigsaw's arrest, he starts the drills. while tapp subdues jigsaw, sing attempts to save jeff. though jigsaw helpfully points out a box that contains the key to release jeff, the box in question is seemingly endlessly filled with keys; sing shoots the drills instead, but the gunshots distract tapp long enough for jigsaw to escape, who slashes and permanently scars tapp's throat in the process. while tapp recovers from his deep knife wound, sing pursues jigsaw and is killed by multiple shotguns set on a tripwire. his partner's death has a permanent effect on tapp, and what was already an unhealthy fascination with the case deepens into an obsession that leads to him being discharged from the police force. convinced from a piece of evidence from earlier in the film that dr. gordon is the jigsaw killer, tapp moves into a house across the street from gordon's and monitors it with video surveillance. back in the bathroom, gordon (with assistance from adam) discovers a box holding cigarettes, a lighter and a note suggesting he dip a cigarette in poisoned blood and uses it to kill adam. gordon and adam attempt to fool the camera by faking adam's death with the cigarette that was not poisoned, but a strong electric shock is sent through adam's chain, proving adam to still be alive. the box also contains a cell phone which cannot make calls but receives one from his wife alison (monica potter), who tells gordon that adam knows more than he is revealing. adam explains that he had been paid by detective tapp to spy on gordon and has witnessed him going to a hotel with the intention of cheating on his wife. in fact, gordon left the hotel before doing anything, but this is between gordon and the other woman, carla (one of the med students to which gordon had been explaining the condition of a patient of his, john kramer), and no mention is made of possible previous encounters. in the pile of adam's photographs which he hid from view of gordon when found with the hacksaws, the two find a photograph of an orderly at gordon's hospital named zep, seen through gordon's window after he left the house. just as this realization is made, however, the hour of six pm strikes. alison manages to free herself and take control of zep's handgun, however she is soon overpowered. shots are fired, which attract the attention of tapp, who wounds zep. he is unable to keep him from leaving the house. zep heads towards the bathroom.\nflung into a state of desperate temporary insanity, gordon follows his instructions by sawing off his foot and shooting adam with the revolver held by the body in the middle of the room and the bullet found in his envelope. zep arrives, pursued by tapp, however zep manages to shoot tapp fatally. he then enters the bathroom but tells gordon he's \"too late,\" because \"it's the rules.\" adam recovers from his gunshot wound, which was in fact non-fatal, and kills zep with the toilet tank lid. gordon crawls away to seek medical attention, promising to return with help. adam searches zep for a key to his chain and instead finds another micro-cassette player. as the climatic theme of the series, \"hello zep\", begins, the tape informs adam, that zep was also following instructions under pain of death. as soon as jigsaw's familiar voice ceases, the body lying in the center of the bathroom lets out a long breath. as adam watches, his face frozen in horror, the dead man peels off the latex that gave the appearance of his head wound and then slowly rises to his feet. he is john kramer, a terminal brain cancer patient of gordon's; he is seen, briefly, in the same flashback where zep is (equally briefly) introduced. jigsaw, whose voice is in fact quite weak, informs adam that the key to his chain was in the bathtub all along; a quick flashback replays the opening scene of the movie, where an object is seen to disappear down the drain with the water. adam reaches for a gun to shoot john, but is stunned with electricity, triggering an extended flashback sequence that runs through the vital shots of the movie in roughly 30 seconds. just before he flicks off the lights in the bathroom for the last time, john repeats a line he said to amanda immediately after she escaped: \"most people are so ungrateful to be alive. but not you. not anymore.\" john then shouts \"game over!\" before slamming the door shut, sealing adam in the bathroom forever, screaming his despair over the credits."

      "plot_summary": "Photographer Adam Faulkner wakes in a grimy industrial bathroom bathtub; as the water drains a small glowing object disappears down the plughole. Surgeon Dr. Lawrence Gordon is chained by one ankle at the opposite side of the same room; both men are shackled to pipes and a bloody dead body lies between them clutching a revolver and a micro-cassette player. Each man finds a taped message in his pocket. They play the tapes: Adam's taunts him as a voyeur; Lawrence's informs him he must kill Adam by 6:00 p.m. or his wife Alison and daughter will be killed and he will remain chained. Lawrence also finds a bullet and a key that doesn't unlock the shackles. They locate hacksaws in the toilet tank but the blades are too dull to cut the chains; Lawrence realizes the saws are intended to amputate their own ankles to free themselves. Flashbacks intercut: previous Jigsaw victims Paul and Mark failed their tests and had puzzle-piece-shaped skin removed; detectives David Tapp and Steven Sing investigate. Amanda Young, a prior survivor, is shown in police custody claiming the test made her a better person. Tapp and Sing break into a suspected Jigsaw lair and find a man (Jeff) tied to drills; the traps injure Tapp and Sing is later killed by shotgun tripwires. Tapp becomes obsessed and surveils Lawrence's house.\n\nBack in the bathroom, Lawrence and Adam find a hidden camera; Lawrence receives a cellphone call from Alison who is being watched by a hospital orderly named Zep. Adam admits he was hired by Tapp to spy on Lawrence and photographed Zep outside Lawrence's house. A box in the bathroom contains cigarettes and a note suggesting Lawrence dip a cigarette in poisoned blood to kill Adam; they attempt to fake Adam's death but an electric shock proves he is alive. At 6:00 p.m. Alison frees herself, confronts Zep and is overpowered as Tapp arrives and wounds Zep; Zep escapes toward the bathroom. Facing the deadline, Lawrence saws off his own right foot, uses the bullet from his envelope and the revolver from the corpse to shoot Adam in the chest, then crawls away to seek help, promising to return. The shot is nonfatal: Adam later kills Zep with a toilet tank lid when Zep enters. Adam searches Zep and finds another tape player; Zep was also following orders under threat. As the tape ends, the dead body in the center breathes, peels off latex to reveal he is John Kramer (the Jigsaw killer), alive despite terminal brain cancer. John tells Adam the key to his chain was in the bathtub all along—the small object washed away at the film's opening—and a flashback confirms this. Before Adam can use the gun he draws, he is stunned with electricity; an extended montage of flashbacks plays. John repeats to Adam the line he told Amanda about being grateful to be alive, shouts \"Game over!\" and locks the bathroom door, sealing Adam inside to die as John, Zep, and an incapacitated Lawrence leave the scene. The final image is Adam screaming behind the sealed door.",

      "soon-to-retire detective lieutenant william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is partnered with short-tempered but idealistic detective david mills ( brad pitt ), who has recently moved to an unnamed large city with his wife tracy. somerset has 7 days to go before his retirement.\nafter forming a friendship with somerset, tracy ( gwyneth paltrow ) confides to him (after she invites somerset for dinner) that she is pregnant and has yet to tell mills, as she is unhappy with the city and feels it is no place to raise a child. somerset sympathizes, having had a similar situation with his ex-girlfriend many years earlier, and advises her to tell mills only if she plans to keep the child. somerset and mills investigate a set of murders inspired by the seven deadly sins: a morbidly obese man ( bob mack ) forced to eat until his stomach burst, representing gluttony (somerset figures that the detail contained in the murder signifies that the act of death means something), and a criminal defense attorney ( gene borkan ) killed after being forced to cut a pound of flesh from himself, representing greed. clues at the murder scenes (the picture in the lawyer's office was hanging upside down and behind it they find fingerprints that don't belong to the victim) lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find a third victim (turns out the fingerprints were from a finger that the killer cut from the 3rd victim), a drug dealer ( michael reid mackay as michael reid mackay) and child molester, strapped to a bed, emaciated and barely alive, representing sloth. the third victim is in critical condition and unable to respond to somerset and mills' questioning. daily photographs of the victim, taken over a year, show the crimes were planned far in advance. the detectives use library records (mills had blurted earlier that the suspect might have a library card) (somerset prints a list of all books related to the 7 deadly sins and uses his contacts at the fbi to find out who has been reading them) to identify a john doe ( kevin spacey ) and track him to his apartment. doe flees and mills gives chase, during which mills falls from a fire escape and injures his arm. mills searches a truck before being struck in the head with a tire iron. while mills is incapacitated, doe walks up and holds him at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. the apartment contains hundreds of notebooks revealing doe's psychopathy, as well as a clue to another murder. the detectives arrive too late to stop a man ( leland orser ) forced by doe at gunpoint to kill a prostitute ( jennifer mueller as cat mueller) by sexually assaulting her with a custom-made, bladed strap-on, representing lust. the following day, they attend the scene of a fifth victim, a model ( heidi schanz ) whose face has been mutilated by doe; she was given the option to call for help and live disfigured or commit suicide by taking pills, and chose the latter option, representing pride. as somerset and mills return to the police station, doe unexpectedly turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. doe offers to confess to his crimes, but only on the condition that he escort somerset and mills to a secret location where the victims representing envy and wrath are presumably buried; otherwise, he will plead insanity. somerset is wary, but mills agrees. during the drive, doe expresses his lack of remorse for his crimes, declaring that his victims deserved to die, and professes himself to be a martyr chosen by a higher power to shock the world out of its state of apathy. doe also makes cryptic, threatening remarks towards mills, who maintains his belief that doe is simply insane. doe's directions lead the detectives to a remote, deserted location. minutes after their arrival, a delivery van approaches. mills holds doe at gunpoint while somerset goes to intercept the driver, who says he was instructed to deliver a box to their coordinates. somerset opens the box and, in a sudden panic, tells mills to stay back. doe reveals that he, himself, represents the sin of envy, as he envied mills' life with tracy and implies that the box contains tracy's decapitated head. he goads mills, telling him that tracy begged for her life and the life of her unborn child, and reacts with surprise and delight when he realizes mills was unaware that tracy was pregnant. despite somerset's warnings, an enraged mills fulfills his own role as wrath and shoots doe fatally and repeatedly, completing doe's plan. somerset and the police captain ( r. lee ermey ) watch as the devastated mills is taken away. when the captain asks where he'll be, somerset says he will be around, implying that he will not retire. in a voiceover, he then quotes hemingway: \"ernest hemingway once wrote, 'the world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' i agree with the second part.\""

      "plot_summary": "In an unnamed, rain-soaked city, Lieutenant William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), days from retirement, is partnered with recently transferred Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Somerset, methodical and world-weary, and Mills, hot-headed and idealistic, begin investigating a grotesque murder: an obese man forced to eat until his stomach bursts; the word \"GLUTTONY\" is written at the scene. They next find a defense attorney dead after being forced to cut a pound of his own flesh; the crime scene has the word \"GREED.\" Somerset deduces the murders follow the seven deadly sins and that the killer stages each death as a moralized punishment.\n\nClues from the lawyer's office—an upside-down picture and foreign fingerprints—lead to an apartment where they find a third victim, a drug dealer and child molester, barely alive and emaciated after being kept strapped to a bed for months (\"SLOTH\"). Photographs show the victim's long torment, indicating meticulous planning. Somerset compiles a list of books about the seven deadly sins and, using library records and his FBI contact, narrows suspects to John Doe (Kevin Spacey). Doe escapes when found in his apartment; Mills pursues and is injured in the chase, then knocked unconscious, allowing Doe to flee. The detectives discover Doe's notebooks and clues to further murders.\n\nThey arrive too late to stop a forced murder representing LUST, in which a man coerced by Doe rapes and kills a prostitute with a bladed device. The next victim, representing PRIDE, is a model who chose disfiguring life over public shame and took her own life; her face is mutilated. After these crimes, John Doe turns himself in, covered in blood. He offers to confess only if Somerset and Mills accompany him to show where the final two victims (ENVY and WRATH) are buried; otherwise he will plead insanity. Against Somerset's caution, Mills accepts.\n\nDoe leads them to a remote rural location. A delivery van arrives with a sealed box; Somerset opens it and discovers its contents. Doe reveals he embodies ENVY—he envies Mills' marriage to Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the life Mills has—and taunts Mills that the box contains Tracy's severed, decapitated head and that she begged for her life and the life of their unborn child (Somerset had previously advised Tracy about her pregnancy). Doe also reveals he knew Tracy was pregnant, a fact Mills did not yet know. Doe goads Mills to become WRATH; despite Somerset's pleas, Mills shoots and fatally executes Doe in a fury, repeatedly firing until Doe is dead. Doe's final act completes the sequence: envy (Doe) causes Mills to kill (wrath). The police arrive; Somerset, devastated by the moral cost, stays on the force rather than retiring. Mills is taken away in handcuffs, inconsolable. In closing voiceover, Somerset rejects naive optimism, quoting Hemingway that the world is \"worth fighting for\" only in the second half of the line.",

      "the kims - mother and father chung-sook and ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son ki-woo and daughter ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of seoul. ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. despite not having that university education, ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to park da-hye, who min plans to date once he returns to seoul and she herself is in university. the parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect namgoong. while mr. and mrs. park are all about status, mrs. park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which min tells ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. in getting the job, ki-woo further learns that mrs. park is looking for an art therapist for the parks' adolescent son, da-song, ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \"jessica\", really ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four kims. in ki-woo also falling for da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the kims as a collective start a plan for all the kims, like ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. the most difficult to get rid of may be moon-gwang, the parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the parks themselves. the question then becomes how far the kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the parks.",
      "jobless, penniless, and utterly hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch ki-taek and his equally unambitious family struggle to make ends meet by working for peanuts in their dingy, basement-level apartment. however, their luck changes when their college-age son, ki-woo, seizes a golden opportunity: entirely unqualified, he has the nerve to pose as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's teenage daughter. and now, the sky is the limit. but as they adopt a winner-take-all strategy and launch a silent class war, the question arises. when it comes to parasites, how does one get rid of them?",
      "after his rich friend asks him to fake qualifications and take his tutor role to a rich teenage girl so none will try to date her in his absence, the poor lead takes up the offer & enters the rich yet gullible family. he then cons his way into the family, dates his friend's crush & schemes to get all his family get a job under the family. when the owners leave the house on vacation they move in & undergo a bizarre encounter which changes the lives of everyone.",
      "the kim family, living in poverty, infiltrates the wealthy park household by securing jobs under false pretenses. initially enjoying comfort and manipulation, tensions rise as hidden secrets, class disparities, and greed surface, culminating in violence. the film examines social inequality, ambition, and moral ambiguity, blending dark comedy, suspense, and tragedy. its narrative explores human desire, deception, and the consequences of systemic inequity, ultimately presenting a critique of modern society and the disparity between wealth and poverty."

    "synopsis": [
      "kim ki-taek (song kang-ho), an unemployed driver, lives with his wife choong-sook (jang hye-jin), son ki-woo (choi woo-shik) and daughter ki-jeong (park so-dam) in a shabby semi-basement apartment. the family struggles to survive, working low-paying gigs such as folding pizza boxes. ki-woo's friend min-hyuk (park seo-joon) visits the family and gifts them a large rock supposed to bring them wealth, before he leaves to study abroad. he suggests ki-woo take over his job as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's youngest daughter, da-hye (jung ji-so). min-hyuk has feelings for da-hye and figures that she will be safe with ki-woo, till he graduates college. in the lavish park mansion, ki-woo is interviewed by mrs. park (cho yeo-jeong) to tutor da-hye and is hired after mrs. park sees his talents (his degrees which were faked by his sister ki-jeong who is a master at forgery) in action.\nlearning of mrs. park's struggle to find an art teacher for her younger child, da-song, ki-woo suggests a \"professional\" named jessica, who in reality is ki-jeong. once hired, ki-jeong gets mr. park's (lee sun-kyun) driver fired (the driver hits on ki-jeong and she accuses him of sexual harassment by placing her panties in the back seat of the mercedes he is in charge of) and replaced with her \"uncle kim\": ki-taek. the kims soon get housekeeper moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) fired (moon-kwang had a rule that the family could not eat peaches, but ki-jeong discovers that its because moon-kwang herself is severely allergic to it and the manipulate the park family to believe that moon-kwang had tuberculosis. this enrages mrs. park, who fires her), with choong-sook hired in her place, employing the entire kim family.\nki-woo ends up kissing da-hye and both are attracted to each other. the parks go on an overnight camping trip, leaving the mansion in choong-sook's care. the kims take the opportunity to have a drunken party in the mansion, during which ki-woo confesses to his family that he is in love with da-hye. in the middle of their celebration, moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) rings the bell and claims that she came to retrieve something in the basement. the other kims hide, then choong-sook lets moon-kwang in. heading to the basement, the former housekeeper opens a secret bunker, revealing that her husband, geun-sae (park myung-hoon), has been hiding for 4 years to avoid loan sharks. as choong-sook threatens to call the police, the rest of the kims, eavesdropping, accidentally stumble into view. moon-kwang quickly records footage of the new \"staff\" addressing each other as father and children, then threatens to send the clip to the parks. the parks call choong-sook to announce that the heavy rain has ruined their camping trip, and they will be home soon. the kims scramble to confine moon-kwang and geun-sae, then clean up and hide, while choong-sook prepares some food requested by mrs. park. moon-kwang breaks free and runs up into the kitchen, but choong-sook pushes her down the basement stairs, severely wounding her head. while eating, mrs. park tells choong-sook that her son was traumatized one birthday by what he thought was a ghost coming up from the basement (he just saw moon-kwang's husband coming into the kitchen from the basement stairs). moon-kwang's husband is tied up by ki-taek and he reveals to him that he has been trying to communicate with mr park via morse code for several years (a light in the dining room has a switch in the basement) (but mr park, never understood morse code and hence never understood the message). after a few close calls, the other three kims leave the mansion undetected. they run back to their apartment, which has been flooded by the storm. they salvage what they can, ki-woo carrying the large \"lucky rock\" min-hyuk gifted his family earlier. the three, along with other displaced citizens, sleep in a gymnasium. meanwhile, moon-kwang dies from her concussion as geun-sae cries. but before dying she cuts off the tape that ki-taek had used to tie her husband up, thus freeing him. the following day, mrs. park throws a birthday party for da-song (jung hyun-joon) and ask the kims to come over and help with all the chores (the kims are bummed as they feel that the parks are totally oblivious to the lives of ordinary people. ki-taek is especially miffed when mrs and mr park, both make insensitive comments about air quality improving from all the rain from the previous night). during the party, ki-woo carries the rock down to the bunker, intending to kill geun-sae. geun-sae ambushes ki-woo, cracks his head open with the rock, then crashes the party, where he stabs ki-jeong in the chest.\ngeun-sae's sudden appearance triggers da-song's traumatic memory, causing the child to have a seizure. ki-taek rushes to stop ki-jeong's bleeding, while mr. park yells at him for the car keys, so park can drive da-song to the hospital. the key lands under the fighting choong-sook and geun-sae, before choong-sook kills geun-sae with a meat skewer. mr. park retrieves the key, while recoiling from geun-sae's \"poor man's smell.\" ki-taek, witnessing mr. park's reaction to the smell, also his own, snaps, fatally stabs him, then flees. the ending is narrated by ki-woo, recounting that ki-jeong died from her wounds, while he required brain surgery and suffered a weeks-long coma; he and choong-sook went to trial and were sentenced to probation. later, watching the parks' mansion, ki-woo notices a light flickering in morse code - a message from ki-taek, who managed to retreat into the bunker in the chaos, and has been hiding from and living off of the new owners. ki-woo promises that one day, he will earn enough money to buy the house and free his father. fantasizing about the day of their reunion, ki-woo ends his letter sitting in the shabby semi-basement apartment where the movie began."

      "plot_summary": "In a semi-basement apartment in Seoul, the unemployed Kim family—father Ki-taek, mother Chung-sook, son Ki-woo, and daughter Ki-jung—struggle to survive doing menial work. Ki-woo’s college friend Min-hyuk visits, gives them a “lucky” rock, and asks Ki-woo to take his job tutoring the wealthy Park family's daughter Park Da-hye while Min-hyuk studies abroad. Ki-woo accepts, using forged credentials prepared by Ki-jung. At the Parks’ modernist house (formerly designed by architect Namgoong), Mrs. Park hires Ki-woo after a soft interview. When Mrs. Park says she needs an art therapist for her younger son Da-song, Ki-woo recommends “Jessica,” actually Ki-jung in disguise, who wins the job. Ki-jung engineers the dismissal of the Parks’ driver by planting her underwear and accusing him of sexual harassment; Ki-taek is then hired as the new driver. The Kims then target housekeeper Moon-gwang: Ki-jung exploits Moon-gwang’s peach allergy and fabricates evidence that Moon-gwang has tuberculosis, prompting Mrs. Park to fire her and hire Chung-sook as replacement, thereby installing all four Kims in the Park household staff.\n\nWhile working in the house, Ki-woo and Da-hye grow close and kiss. The Parks go on an overnight camping trip; the Kims throw a drunken celebration in the empty mansion and confess ambitions to stay in the house. Moon-gwang unexpectedly returns to retrieve a lost item and reveals a hidden bunker in the basement where her husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living for four years to hide from loan sharks. Moon-gwang records footage of the Kims posing as a family and threatens to expose them to the Parks. The Parks cut their trip short due to heavy rain; the Kims rush to conceal Moon-gwang and Geun-sae. Moon-gwang breaks free, is pushed down the basement stairs by Chung-sook, and suffers a fatal head injury. Geun-sae is bound in the basement; before dying Moon-gwang frees him by cutting the tape.\n\nA storm floods the Kims’ apartment; they sleep in an evacuation gymnasium while Moon-gwang dies and Geun-sae remains in the house. The next day the Parks throw Da-song’s birthday party and summon the Kims to help. Ki-woo carries the lucky rock to the bunker intending to kill Geun-sae; Geun-sae ambushes him, fatally strikes Ki-woo’s head with the rock, then bursts into the party and stabs Ki-jung. Da-song has a seizure triggered by seeing Geun-sae. In the ensuing chaos, Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a meat skewer. Mr. Park recoils from Geun-sae’s smell while reaching for the car keys; Ki-taek, enraged by Mr. Park’s contemptuous reaction to “poor” smell, stabs and kills Mr. Park and then flees. Ki-woo is gravely injured and later requires brain surgery and a coma; Ki-jung dies of her wounds. Ki-taek goes into hiding in the Park house’s bunker during the confusion.\n\nThe film’s epilogue is narrated by Ki-woo from the semi-basement apartment: Ki-taek has been living secretly in the bunker beneath the Parks’ house, sending Morse-code light signals via a dining-room lamp; Ki-woo vows to earn enough money to buy the house and free his father, imagining a future reunion that remains unresolved as he watches the mansion.",

      "kim ki-taek (song kang-ho), an unemployed driver, lives with his wife choong-sook (jang hye-jin), son ki-woo (choi woo-shik) and daughter ki-jeong (park so-dam) in a shabby semi-basement apartment. the family struggles to survive, working low-paying gigs such as folding pizza boxes. ki-woo's friend min-hyuk (park seo-joon) visits the family and gifts them a large rock supposed to bring them wealth, before he leaves to study abroad. he suggests ki-woo take over his job as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's youngest daughter, da-hye (jung ji-so). min-hyuk has feelings for da-hye and figures that she will be safe with ki-woo, till he graduates college. in the lavish park mansion, ki-woo is interviewed by mrs. park (cho yeo-jeong) to tutor da-hye and is hired after mrs. park sees his talents (his degrees which were faked by his sister ki-jeong who is a master at forgery) in action.\nlearning of mrs. park's struggle to find an art teacher for her younger child, da-song, ki-woo suggests a \"professional\" named jessica, who in reality is ki-jeong. once hired, ki-jeong gets mr. park's (lee sun-kyun) driver fired (the driver hits on ki-jeong and she accuses him of sexual harassment by placing her panties in the back seat of the mercedes he is in charge of) and replaced with her \"uncle kim\": ki-taek. the kims soon get housekeeper moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) fired (moon-kwang had a rule that the family could not eat peaches, but ki-jeong discovers that its because moon-kwang herself is severely allergic to it and the manipulate the park family to believe that moon-kwang had tuberculosis. this enrages mrs. park, who fires her), with choong-sook hired in her place, employing the entire kim family.\nki-woo ends up kissing da-hye and both are attracted to each other. the parks go on an overnight camping trip, leaving the mansion in choong-sook's care. the kims take the opportunity to have a drunken party in the mansion, during which ki-woo confesses to his family that he is in love with da-hye. in the middle of their celebration, moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) rings the bell and claims that she came to retrieve something in the basement. the other kims hide, then choong-sook lets moon-kwang in. heading to the basement, the former housekeeper opens a secret bunker, revealing that her husband, geun-sae (park myung-hoon), has been hiding for 4 years to avoid loan sharks. as choong-sook threatens to call the police, the rest of the kims, eavesdropping, accidentally stumble into view. moon-kwang quickly records footage of the new \"staff\" addressing each other as father and children, then threatens to send the clip to the parks. the parks call choong-sook to announce that the heavy rain has ruined their camping trip, and they will be home soon. the kims scramble to confine moon-kwang and geun-sae, then clean up and hide, while choong-sook prepares some food requested by mrs. park. moon-kwang breaks free and runs up into the kitchen, but choong-sook pushes her down the basement stairs, severely wounding her head. while eating, mrs. park tells choong-sook that her son was traumatized one birthday by what he thought was a ghost coming up from the basement (he just saw moon-kwang's husband coming into the kitchen from the basement stairs). moon-kwang's husband is tied up by ki-taek and he reveals to him that he has been trying to communicate with mr park via morse code for several years (a light in the dining room has a switch in the basement) (but mr park, never understood morse code and hence never understood the message). after a few close calls, the other three kims leave the mansion undetected. they run back to their apartment, which has been flooded by the storm. they salvage what they can, ki-woo carrying the large \"lucky rock\" min-hyuk gifted his family earlier. the three, along with other displaced citizens, sleep in a gymnasium. meanwhile, moon-kwang dies from her concussion as geun-sae cries. but before dying she cuts off the tape that ki-taek had used to tie her husband up, thus freeing him. the following day, mrs. park throws a birthday party for da-song (jung hyun-joon) and ask the kims to come over and help with all the chores (the kims are bummed as they feel that the parks are totally oblivious to the lives of ordinary people. ki-taek is especially miffed when mrs and mr park, both make insensitive comments about air quality improving from all the rain from the previous night). during the party, ki-woo carries the rock down to the bunker, intending to kill geun-sae. geun-sae ambushes ki-woo, cracks his head open with the rock, then crashes the party, where he stabs ki-jeong in the chest.\ngeun-sae's sudden appearance triggers da-song's traumatic memory, causing the child to have a seizure. ki-taek rushes to stop ki-jeong's bleeding, while mr. park yells at him for the car keys, so park can drive da-song to the hospital. the key lands under the fighting choong-sook and geun-sae, before choong-sook kills geun-sae with a meat skewer. mr. park retrieves the key, while recoiling from geun-sae's \"poor man's smell.\" ki-taek, witnessing mr. park's reaction to the smell, also his own, snaps, fatally stabs him, then flees. the ending is narrated by ki-woo, recounting that ki-jeong died from her wounds, while he required brain surgery and suffered a weeks-long coma; he and choong-sook went to trial and were sentenced to probation. later, watching the parks' mansion, ki-woo notices a light flickering in morse code - a message from ki-taek, who managed to retreat into the bunker in the chaos, and has been hiding from and living off of the new owners. ki-woo promises that one day, he will earn enough money to buy the house and free his father. fantasizing about the day of their reunion, ki-woo ends his letter sitting in the shabby semi-basement apartment where the movie began."

      "the kims - mother and father chung-sook and ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son ki-woo and daughter ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of seoul. ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. despite not having that university education, ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to park da-hye, who min plans to date once he returns to seoul and she herself is in university. the parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect namgoong. while mr. and mrs. park are all about status, mrs. park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which min tells ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. in getting the job, ki-woo further learns that mrs. park is looking for an art therapist for the parks' adolescent son, da-song, ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \"jessica\", really ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four kims. in ki-woo also falling for da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the kims as a collective start a plan for all the kims, like ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. the most difficult to get rid of may be moon-gwang, the parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the parks themselves. the question then becomes how far the kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the parks.",
      "jobless, penniless, and utterly hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch ki-taek and his equally unambitious family struggle to make ends meet by working for peanuts in their dingy, basement-level apartment. however, their luck changes when their college-age son, ki-woo, seizes a golden opportunity: entirely unqualified, he has the nerve to pose as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's teenage daughter. and now, the sky is the limit. but as they adopt a winner-take-all strategy and launch a silent class war, the question arises. when it comes to parasites, how does one get rid of them?",
      "after his rich friend asks him to fake qualifications and take his tutor role to a rich teenage girl so none will try to date her in his absence, the poor lead takes up the offer & enters the rich yet gullible family. he then cons his way into the family, dates his friend's crush & schemes to get all his family get a job under the family. when the owners leave the house on vacation they move in & undergo a bizarre encounter which changes the lives of everyone.",
      "the kim family, living in poverty, infiltrates the wealthy park household by securing jobs under false pretenses. initially enjoying comfort and manipulation, tensions rise as hidden secrets, class disparities, and greed surface, culminating in violence. the film examines social inequality, ambition, and moral ambiguity, blending dark comedy, suspense, and tragedy. its narrative explores human desire, deception, and the consequences of systemic inequity, ultimately presenting a critique of modern society and the disparity between wealth and poverty."

    "synopsis": [
      "on a suburban street at night, an african american man walks alone, talking on the phone. a car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, the man starts to walk away. a person wearing a helmet, tackles and subdues the man, drags him into the car, and drives away. photographer chris washington (daniel kaluuya) reluctantly agrees to meet the family of his white girlfriend rose armitage (allison williams), unsure of a warm reception as they do not know that he is african american, and he does not want to shock them with his sudden appearance. chris is in excellent physical condition, is young and has an incredible skill of taking breathtaking photographs.\nrose assures chris that her parents are not racists. during their drive to the family's countryside estate, they hit a deer and report the incident. the white policeman asks for chris's identification even though he was not driving, but rose intervenes, and the encounter goes unrecorded. chris was more than happy to share his id with the policeman, but rose was indignant and alleged that chris was being profiled for being an african american while he had nothing to do with the deer incident. the policeman eventually relents and backs off. at the house, rose's white parents, neurosurgeon dean (bradley whitford) and psychiatrist/hypnotherapist missy (catherine keener), and her brother jeremy (caleb landry jones) make discomfiting comments about african american people. chris and rose had been dating for 4 months. dean's father was defeated by jesse owens in the trials for the berlin olympics. dean adds that he loved obama as a president and would have loved to see him get a third term.\nthe house is completed secluded, and the nearest neighbor is across a lake adjoining the property. jeremy shares embarrassing stories about rose at dinner. chris also observes eerie, unnatural behavior from the family's african american servants, georgina and walter. dean calls out the cliche of a white family having african american servants in the house to make light of the observation.\nchris shares that he never met his dad and his mother passed away when he was 11, so he has no family that looks out for him. chris notices that the african american workers at the estate are uncannily compliant. unable to sleep, chris goes outside to smoke and sees groundskeeper walter running from the woods. missy catches chris returning and talks him into a hypnotherapy session to cure his smoking addiction, using the noise of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger. in a trance, he recounts the death of his mother in a hit-and-run when he was a child, about which he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. he sinks into a void missy calls the \"sunken place\" where his body becomes temporarily paralyzed. he awakens believing he had a nightmare but realizes cigarettes now revolt him. the african american housekeeper georgina (betty gabriel) unplugs his phone, draining his battery. dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the armitages' annual get-together. they take an interest in chris, admiring his physique or expressing admiration for african american figures such as tiger woods. chris meets a blind art dealer, jim hudson, who takes an interest in his photography. chris meets logan king (lakeith stanfield), an african american man who also acts strangely, and who is married to a much older white woman. chris calls his friend, african american tsa officer rod williams (lil rel howery), about the hypnosis and the strange behavior at the house. when chris attempts to stealthily photograph logan, the camera flash causes logan to become hysterical, rushing at chris and frantically lashing out for him to \"get out\". logan is taken away by dean, who later claims logan had a seizure. away from the house, chris persuades rose to leave with him, while dean holds an auction with a picture of chris on display. chris sends logan's photo to rod, who recognizes him as andre, a missing man from brooklyn. while packing to leave, chris finds photos of rose in prior relationships with african american people, including walter and georgina, contradicting her claim that he is the first african american person she has dated. chris tries to leave, but rose refuses to give him the car keys. jeremy blocks the door and missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send chris back to the sunken place. chris awakens strapped to a chair. a video presentation featuring rose's grandfather roman (richard herd) explains that the family transplants the brains of white people into african american bodies. the consciousness of the host remains in the \"sunken place\", watching but powerless. jim hudson (stephen root), a blind art dealer says transplanting their brains into africa american people is the latest \"fad\", but clarifies that he does not care about chris's race and that he only wants chris's eyesight and his artistic talents. meanwhile, rod, who has been trying to contact chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they do not believe his theory about the armitages. missy attempts to hypnotize chris again, but chris plugs his ears with stuffing pulled from the chair, blocking the hypnotic commands. when jeremy comes to collect him for the surgery, chris bludgeons jeremy and then kills dean (who falls and accidentally sets fire to the room) and missy when she attacks him, before finishing off jeremy when he attacks again. chris tries to escape in jeremy's porsche but accidentally hits georgina, who has the brain of rose's grandmother, marianne. compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he picks her up, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and kill her. rose and walter, who has the brain of rose's grandfather, roman, arrive to capture chris. during a scuffle, chris uses his phone's flash to briefly free walter from roman's control. walter takes rose's rifle, shoots her, and fatally shoots himself. chris starts strangling rose, but cannot bring himself to kill her. a police car arrives and chris surrenders, but it's revealed to be rod. he picks up chris, leaving rose bleeding on the road."

      "plot_summary": "Photographer Chris Washington drives with his girlfriend Rose Armitage to her family's secluded Armitage estate in the countryside to meet her parents, neurosurgeon Dean and psychiatrist/hypnotherapist Missy Armitage, and her brother Jeremy. En route they hit a deer; a white cop stops them and asks for Chris's ID even though Rose was driving. At the house Chris notices odd, overly accommodating behavior from Dean, Missy and the white guests, and unnaturally passive behavior from the estate's Black staff, housekeeper Georgina and groundskeeper Walter. At dinner Jeremy tells embarrassing stories about Rose; Dean makes awkward comments about Black athletes and history. That night Missy persuades Chris to try hypnotherapy to quit smoking; during the session she induces a trance and drives him into what she later calls the \"sunken place,\" a dissociative state where his consciousness is trapped while his body remains controllable. After the session Chris finds his phone drained when Georgina unplugs it. The Armitage family hosts an annual garden party attended by wealthy white acquaintances and two apparent Black guests: Logan King (who later is identified as a missing man, Andre) and blind art dealer Jim Hudson. Many guests fetishize Black bodies and Black cultural figures; Jim expresses interest in Chris's photography and eyes. Chris calls his friend Rod Williams, a TSA officer, to report the strange hypnosis and behavior. Chris stealthily photographs Logan/Andre, whose violent reaction to the flash leads Dean to claim Andre had a seizure. Chris discovers photos showing Rose previously dating Black men, contradicting her claim that Chris is her first Black boyfriend. Chris attempts to leave with Rose but finds the car keys withheld; Jeremy blocks exits and Missy hypnotizes him again to the sunken place. Chris later wakes restrained in a chair in a locked room. A video featuring Rose's grandfather Roman explains the family's operation: Dean and Missy's extended circle buys and transplants the brains/essences of elderly white clients into the bodies of healthy Black people, erasing the original occupants by relegating their consciousness to the \"sunken place.\" Jim reveals he commissioned a body for his art-dealer career; the Armitages plan to auction Chris's body. Rod investigates after Chris stops answering and fails to convince local police. Missy attempts to hypnotize Chris for the surgery, but he blocks her by stuffing earplugs into his ears. When Jeremy arrives to take him to surgery, Chris fights back: he bludgeons Jeremy, and during a struggle kills Dean (who falls into a furnace and ignites a fire) and Mortally wounds Missy when she attacks him. Chris escapes into the garage and crashes Jeremy's Porsche while stopping for the injured Georgina (whose body houses Rose's grandmother Marianne's consciousness). Georgina/Marianne attacks, causing the car to crash and Georgina to be killed. Rose and Walter (whose body houses Roman's consciousness) arrive; during the confrontation Chris briefly uses his camera flash to disorient Walter/Roman, freeing Walter momentarily. Walter picks up Rose's rifle, shoots Rose, then fatally shoots himself, killing Roman's takeover. Chris begins to strangle the dying Rose but cannot deliver the kill. A car approaches and Chris surrenders, believing it's police; it is Rod, who had come to rescue him — Rod drives off with Chris, leaving Rose dying on the road.",

      "on a suburban street at night, an african american man walks alone, talking on the phone. a car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, the man starts to walk away. a person wearing a helmet, tackles and subdues the man, drags him into the car, and drives away. photographer chris washington (daniel kaluuya) reluctantly agrees to meet the family of his white girlfriend rose armitage (allison williams), unsure of a warm reception as they do not know that he is african american, and he does not want to shock them with his sudden appearance. chris is in excellent physical condition, is young and has an incredible skill of taking breathtaking photographs.\nrose assures chris that her parents are not racists. during their drive to the family's countryside estate, they hit a deer and report the incident. the white policeman asks for chris's identification even though he was not driving, but rose intervenes, and the encounter goes unrecorded. chris was more than happy to share his id with the policeman, but rose was indignant and alleged that chris was being profiled for being an african american while he had nothing to do with the deer incident. the policeman eventually relents and backs off. at the house, rose's white parents, neurosurgeon dean (bradley whitford) and psychiatrist/hypnotherapist missy (catherine keener), and her brother jeremy (caleb landry jones) make discomfiting comments about african american people. chris and rose had been dating for 4 months. dean's father was defeated by jesse owens in the trials for the berlin olympics. dean adds that he loved obama as a president and would have loved to see him get a third term.\nthe house is completed secluded, and the nearest neighbor is across a lake adjoining the property. jeremy shares embarrassing stories about rose at dinner. chris also observes eerie, unnatural behavior from the family's african american servants, georgina and walter. dean calls out the cliche of a white family having african american servants in the house to make light of the observation.\nchris shares that he never met his dad and his mother passed away when he was 11, so he has no family that looks out for him. chris notices that the african american workers at the estate are uncannily compliant. unable to sleep, chris goes outside to smoke and sees groundskeeper walter running from the woods. missy catches chris returning and talks him into a hypnotherapy session to cure his smoking addiction, using the noise of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger. in a trance, he recounts the death of his mother in a hit-and-run when he was a child, about which he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. he sinks into a void missy calls the \"sunken place\" where his body becomes temporarily paralyzed. he awakens believing he had a nightmare but realizes cigarettes now revolt him. the african american housekeeper georgina (betty gabriel) unplugs his phone, draining his battery. dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the armitages' annual get-together. they take an interest in chris, admiring his physique or expressing admiration for african american figures such as tiger woods. chris meets a blind art dealer, jim hudson, who takes an interest in his photography. chris meets logan king (lakeith stanfield), an african american man who also acts strangely, and who is married to a much older white woman. chris calls his friend, african american tsa officer rod williams (lil rel howery), about the hypnosis and the strange behavior at the house. when chris attempts to stealthily photograph logan, the camera flash causes logan to become hysterical, rushing at chris and frantically lashing out for him to \"get out\". logan is taken away by dean, who later claims logan had a seizure. away from the house, chris persuades rose to leave with him, while dean holds an auction with a picture of chris on display. chris sends logan's photo to rod, who recognizes him as andre, a missing man from brooklyn. while packing to leave, chris finds photos of rose in prior relationships with african american people, including walter and georgina, contradicting her claim that he is the first african american person she has dated. chris tries to leave, but rose refuses to give him the car keys. jeremy blocks the door and missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send chris back to the sunken place. chris awakens strapped to a chair. a video presentation featuring rose's grandfather roman (richard herd) explains that the family transplants the brains of white people into african american bodies. the consciousness of the host remains in the \"sunken place\", watching but powerless. jim hudson (stephen root), a blind art dealer says transplanting their brains into africa american people is the latest \"fad\", but clarifies that he does not care about chris's race and that he only wants chris's eyesight and his artistic talents. meanwhile, rod, who has been trying to contact chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they do not believe his theory about the armitages. missy attempts to hypnotize chris again, but chris plugs his ears with stuffing pulled from the chair, blocking the hypnotic commands. when jeremy comes to collect him for the surgery, chris bludgeons jeremy and then kills dean (who falls and accidentally sets fire to the room) and missy when she attacks him, before finishing off jeremy when he attacks again. chris tries to escape in jeremy's porsche but accidentally hits georgina, who has the brain of rose's grandmother, marianne. compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he picks her up, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and kill her. rose and walter, who has the brain of rose's grandfather, roman, arrive to capture chris. during a scuffle, chris uses his phone's flash to briefly free walter from roman's control. walter takes rose's rifle, shoots her, and fatally shoots himself. chris starts strangling rose, but cannot bring himself to kill her. a police car arrives and chris surrenders, but it's revealed to be rod. he picks up chris, leaving rose bleeding on the road."

      "chris and his girlfriend rose go upstate to visit her parents for the weekend. at first, chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.",
      "rose armitage is taking her boyfriend, chris washington, to meet her parents for the first time. he's a bit uneasy about how they'll treat him, as they're white and he's black. however, her parents turn out to be unfazed and everything seems to be going fine. chris then starts to notice some weird behavioral traits with the african-american staff at the house. the armitages throw a huge party and chris ends up in some awkward conversations with the guests. initially, he just puts it down to the racial difference, but then the guests', and armitages', motives start to appear more sinister. chris decides it is time to get out.",
      "having reached the major meet-the-parents milestone in his 5-month relationship with his lovely white girlfriend rose, talented young african-american photographer chris is on pins and needles. not knowing what to expect, chris arrives at their luxurious, secluded estate in the woods for the weekend. but except for rose, no one else knows that her boyfriend is black. of course, rose's psychiatrist mother and neurosurgeon father are cordial. however, after breaking the ice, chris senses an indistinguishable threat looming over the meeting. then, sheer dread follows, exposing the cryptic family's polite facade. as chris tries to understand, haunting questions arise. are rose's parents hiding something? and why is there a locked, off-limits room leading to the basement?",
      "a young african-american photographer by the name of chris washington is dragged out to his girlfriend's parents' house to spend the weekend and meet the family. chris feels unwelcome, considering there are only three other african-americans on the farm, and two of them work on it. as the weekend progresses, chris starts noticing some weird things around the farm and when he snaps a picture of one of the family members, the man freaks out. the sense of uneasiness is in the air and it continues to grow as chris finds out the strange truth of what is really going on in this place."

      "in 1987, wealthy new york investment banker patrick bateman's (christian bale) life revolves around dining at trendy restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fiance evelyn (reese witherspoon) and for his circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of whom he dislikes. bateman describes the material accouterments of his lifestyle, including his daily morning exercise and beautification routine. he also discusses his music collection, with performers such as huey lewis and the news, phil collins, and whitney houston. his focus on a lavish lifestyle is also evident by his taste in expensive designer clothing and his luxurious apartment.\nbateman is having an affair with evelyn' friend courtney (samantha mathis), while evelyn is having an affair with bateman's coworker timothy (justin theroux). courtney is engaged to bateman's other colleague luis carruthers (who is slightly gay). bateman and his associates flaunt their business cards in a display of vanity. enraged by the superiority of co-worker paul allen's (jared leto) card, bateman murders a homeless man and kills the man's dog. at a christmas party, bateman makes plans to have dinner with paul, with paul mistaking bateman for another coworker, marcus halberstram (anthony lemke). bateman gets paul drunk and lures him back to his apartment. while playing \"hip to be square\" on the stereo, explaining to paul his opinion and interpretation of the song, bateman murders paul with an ax, donning a raincoat moments before, to keep blood off of his clothes. he disposes of paul's body, then goes to paul's apartment to stage the situation so that others believe paul has run off to london. bateman is later interviewed about paul's disappearance in his office by private detective donald kimball (willem dafoe), hired by paul's family. during the night, bateman takes two prostitutes, whom he names christie (cara seymour) and sabrina (krista sutton), to his apartment and explains to them the improvement he saw in the band genesis after they moved away from progressive rock toward a more pop rock sound beginning with the album duke. after they have sex, bateman tells them to stay, while taking out instruments he uses for torture. in the next scene, the prostitutes leave his apartment bruised and bloodied. in the entire sequence, bateman makes sure that he introduces himself as paul allen. the next day, bateman's colleague luis carruthers (matt ross) reveals his new business card. bateman tries to kill luis in the restroom of an expensive restaurant but cannot bring himself to strangle him. luis mistakes the attempted murder for a sexual advance and declares his love for bateman, who flees in disgust. after murdering a model, bateman invites his secretary, jean (chloë sevigny), to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks beforehand. when jean arrives, bateman, unbeknownst to her, holds a nail gun to the back of her head while the two converse. when he receives an answering machine message from his fiance, he asks jean to leave. kimball meets bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion. bateman has a threesome with his friend elizabeth (guinevere turner) and christie at paul's apartment. bateman kills elizabeth during sex, and christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses as she searches for an exit. she is chased by a naked bateman wielding a chainsaw, and as she is running down the stairs of paul's apartment building, is killed by the chainsaw which bateman drops from several levels above her. bateman breaks off his engagement with evelyn. that night, as he uses an atm, he finds a stray kitten; the atm displays the text \"feed me a stray cat\". as he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman sees him and tries to stop him; he shoots her and lets the cat go free. a police chase ensues, but bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks. fleeing to his office, bateman enters the wrong office building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. in an office he believes to be his, bateman calls his lawyer harold (stephen bogaert) and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on harold's answering machine. the following morning, bateman visits paul's apartment, expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation, but it is vacant and for sale. the real estate broker tells him to leave. as bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch, a horrified jean finds detailed drawings of murder, mutilation, and sexual assault in bateman's office journal. bateman sees harold at a restaurant and tries to convince him that he is a serial killer relating to the phone message he left the other night. harold mistakes bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke, saying he had dinner with paul in london days earlier. a confused bateman returns to his friends and in a final voice-over narration, he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves, that there has been no catharsis: \"this confession has meant nothing\"."

      "in 1987, wealthy new york investment banker patrick bateman's (christian bale) life revolves around dining at trendy restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fiance evelyn (reese witherspoon) and for his circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of whom he dislikes. bateman describes the material accouterments of his lifestyle, including his daily morning exercise and beautification routine. he also discusses his music collection, with performers such as huey lewis and the news, phil collins, and whitney houston. his focus on a lavish lifestyle is also evident by his taste in expensive designer clothing and his luxurious apartment.\nbateman is having an affair with evelyn' friend courtney (samantha mathis), while evelyn is having an affair with bateman's coworker timothy (justin theroux). courtney is engaged to bateman's other colleague luis carruthers (who is slightly gay). bateman and his associates flaunt their business cards in a display of vanity. enraged by the superiority of co-worker paul allen's (jared leto) card, bateman murders a homeless man and kills the man's dog. at a christmas party, bateman makes plans to have dinner with paul, with paul mistaking bateman for another coworker, marcus halberstram (anthony lemke). bateman gets paul drunk and lures him back to his apartment. while playing \"hip to be square\" on the stereo, explaining to paul his opinion and interpretation of the song, bateman murders paul with an ax, donning a raincoat moments before, to keep blood off of his clothes. he disposes of paul's body, then goes to paul's apartment to stage the situation so that others believe paul has run off to london. bateman is later interviewed about paul's disappearance in his office by private detective donald kimball (willem dafoe), hired by paul's family. during the night, bateman takes two prostitutes, whom he names christie (cara seymour) and sabrina (krista sutton), to his apartment and explains to them the improvement he saw in the band genesis after they moved away from progressive rock toward a more pop rock sound beginning with the album duke. after they have sex, bateman tells them to stay, while taking out instruments he uses for torture. in the next scene, the prostitutes leave his apartment bruised and bloodied. in the entire sequence, bateman makes sure that he introduces himself as paul allen. the next day, bateman's colleague luis carruthers (matt ross) reveals his new business card. bateman tries to kill luis in the restroom of an expensive restaurant but cannot bring himself to strangle him. luis mistakes the attempted murder for a sexual advance and declares his love for bateman, who flees in disgust. after murdering a model, bateman invites his secretary, jean (chloë sevigny), to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks beforehand. when jean arrives, bateman, unbeknownst to her, holds a nail gun to the back of her head while the two converse. when he receives an answering machine message from his fiance, he asks jean to leave. kimball meets bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion. bateman has a threesome with his friend elizabeth (guinevere turner) and christie at paul's apartment. bateman kills elizabeth during sex, and christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses as she searches for an exit. she is chased by a naked bateman wielding a chainsaw, and as she is running down the stairs of paul's apartment building, is killed by the chainsaw which bateman drops from several levels above her. bateman breaks off his engagement with evelyn. that night, as he uses an atm, he finds a stray kitten; the atm displays the text \"feed me a stray cat\". as he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman sees him and tries to stop him; he shoots her and lets the cat go free. a police chase ensues, but bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks. fleeing to his office, bateman enters the wrong office building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. in an office he believes to be his, bateman calls his lawyer harold (stephen bogaert) and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on harold's answering machine. the following morning, bateman visits paul's apartment, expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation, but it is vacant and for sale. the real estate broker tells him to leave. as bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch, a horrified jean finds detailed drawings of murder, mutilation, and sexual assault in bateman's office journal. bateman sees harold at a restaurant and tries to convince him that he is a serial killer relating to the phone message he left the other night. harold mistakes bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke, saying he had dinner with paul in london days earlier. a confused bateman returns to his friends and in a final voice-over narration, he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves, that there has been no catharsis: \"this confession has meant nothing\"."

    "synopsis": [
      "the narrator (edward norton) is an automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform product recall cost appraisals. his job is to assess if the cost of recall for the cars would be higher or lower than the cost of payouts on claims against product failure in the field. this decides whether a recall is initiated.\nhis apartment is an advertisement for the ikea catalog. his doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia (he hadn't been able to sleep for 6 months) and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. by attending the group, the narrator feels distraught at the condition of these ill-fated people and breaks down. he meets robert \"bob\" paulson (meat loaf) who cries endlessly and hugs the narrator for emotional support. the narrator also cried in bob's arms.\nhe is then able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups in order to release his pent-up emotions and get a good cry which helped him sleep. the narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, marla singer (helena bonham carter), at the same meetings and his insomnia returns. the narrator knew that marla had no diseases and was probably attending the support group meetings for the same reasons as him. the narrator could not cry as he felt that his lie was caught.\nhe arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees. during a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets tyler durden (brad pitt), who is a soap salesman. tyler says that one can make all kinds of explosive using simple household items. the narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion, which is assessed to be a possible gas leak. the narrator calls marla but does not speak to her, and then calls tyler as he had his phone number from the flight.\nhe calls tyler and meets him at a bar. tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. the narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar.\ntyler works as a night shift projectionist at a movie theater splices single shot of pornographic films into regular family films being screened at the theater. he also works as a waiter at the pressman hotel, where he urinates into the soup and performs other degenerate acts on food items served to rich customers. the narrator moves into tyler's dilapidated house (the windows were boarded up, the stairs were about to collapse and there was no lock on the front door) and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the parking lot. after attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement.\nthe rules of the fight club include stuff like never talk about fight club, no shirt no shoes, a fight goes on for as long as it needs to, only 2 to a fight, one fight at a time, if you are new to fight club you have to fight and so on. marla contacts the narrator at his new phone number and wants to know why he hasn't been attending his support groups. the narrator says that he found a new one. that night the narrator has a dream about having sex with marla. but then he finds marla in the house, who just had sex with tyler. the narrator has no clue how marla got there and that confuses her, and she leaves in a huff. turns out marla had overdosed on xanax; she was rescued by tyler (the narrator had left the phone on the table while marla was talking and tyler picked it up and went to her room) and the two embark upon a sexual relationship. tyler makes the narrator promise never to talk about him with marla. under tyler's leadership, the fight club becomes \"project mayhem,\" which commits increasingly destructive acts of anti-capitalist vandalism in the city. the fight clubs become a network for a new underground organization, project mayhem, and the narrator is left out of tyler's activities with the project. after an argument, tyler disappears from the narrator's life and when a member of project mayhem dies on a mission, the narrator attempts to shut down the project. tracing tyler's steps, he travels around the country to find that fight clubs have been started in every major city, where one of the participants identifies the narrator as tyler durden. a phone call to marla confirms his identity and he realizes that tyler is the alter ego of his own split personality. tyler appears before him and explains that he controls the narrator's body whenever he is asleep and represents the narrator's basest urges: he is physically fit, assertive, aggressive, has a strong sexual prowess and is \"free in all the ways\" the narrator isn't. the narrator, overcome with the epiphany, faints and tyler disappears. the narrator awakes to find tyler has made several phone calls during his blackout and traces his plans to the downtown headquarters of several major credit card companies, which tyler intends to destroy in order to cripple the financial networks. tyler and the demolitions squad of project mayhem had wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.\nfailing to find help with the police, many of whom are members of project mayhem, the narrator attempts to disarm the explosives in the basement of one of the buildings. he is confronted by tyler, knocked unconscious after a lengthy fight, and taken to the upper floor of another building to witness the impending destruction. the narrator, held by tyler at gunpoint, realizes that, in sharing the same body with tyler, he is the one who is actually holding the gun. he fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. the illusion of tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head. shortly after, members of project mayhem bring a kidnapped marla to the narrator and leave them alone. the bombs detonate and, holding hands, the two witness the destruction of the entire financial city block through the windows."

      "plot_summary": "An unnamed narrator (an insurance/automobile company employee) suffers chronic insomnia and, at his doctor's suggestion, attends late-night support groups for terminally ill patients to provoke emotional release and sleep. In the testicular cancer group he meets Robert \"Bob\" Paulson and learns the catharsis works; he begins faking illnesses to attend other groups. His routine is broken when he encounters Marla Singer, another impostor, whose presence prevents him from crying and restores his insomnia. On a business flight he meets Tyler Durden, a charismatic soap salesman. Returning home, the narrator finds his condominium destroyed in an explosion; he calls Tyler, who invites him to stay at his dilapidated house in Los Angeles on the condition that he hit Tyler. They trade punches outside a bar and, after attracting an audience, start an underground bare-knuckle fight club in the bar basement with strict rules (including \"you do not talk about Fight Club\"). The narrator moves into Tyler's house; Tyler works odd jobs (movie projectionist, hotel waiter) and sells homemade soap while espousing anti-capitalist rhetoric.\n\nFight Club grows into a nationwide network of men's fight clubs. Marla tracks down the narrator and, after an overdose, is rescued by Tyler; she and Tyler begin a sexual relationship. Under Tyler's leadership the organization escalates into \"Project Mayhem,\" a paramilitary, anti-capitalist campaign that vandalizes and sabotages corporate targets and recruits willing men for missions. The narrator is increasingly sidelined: Tyler plans operations without him and recruits followers who obey orders without question. When a Project Mayhem member (Bob) dies during a mission, the narrator attempts to shut things down and discovers fight clubs and Project Mayhem cells in many cities. Members tell him they know him as Tyler Durden. Confused, he traces Tyler's activities and uncovers evidence that conflicts with his memories.\n\nA breakthrough occurs when the narrator realizes Tyler is his dissociated alter ego: Tyler embodies his repressed aggression and charisma and takes control of his body whenever the narrator is unconscious. After collapsing from the revelation, the narrator awakens to find Tyler has placed explosives—wrapped in the foundations of several major downtown corporate buildings, including credit card company headquarters—set to detonate simultaneously. The narrator seeks help but discovers many police are Project Mayhem sympathizers. He infiltrates one targeted building, tries to find and disarm the explosives, and confronts Tyler in a final struggle. During the fight the narrator realizes he is the one holding the gun and, to stop Tyler, shoots himself through the cheek; the wound destroys the Tyler hallucination. Project Mayhem brings a subdued Marla to the narrator; as the bombs detonate the narrator and Marla hold hands and watch the collapse of several corporate towers through the building windows.",

      "the narrator (edward norton) is an automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform product recall cost appraisals. his job is to assess if the cost of recall for the cars would be higher or lower than the cost of payouts on claims against product failure in the field. this decides whether a recall is initiated.\nhis apartment is an advertisement for the ikea catalog. his doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia (he hadn't been able to sleep for 6 months) and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. by attending the group, the narrator feels distraught at the condition of these ill-fated people and breaks down. he meets robert \"bob\" paulson (meat loaf) who cries endlessly and hugs the narrator for emotional support. the narrator also cried in bob's arms.\nhe is then able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups in order to release his pent-up emotions and get a good cry which helped him sleep. the narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, marla singer (helena bonham carter), at the same meetings and his insomnia returns. the narrator knew that marla had no diseases and was probably attending the support group meetings for the same reasons as him. the narrator could not cry as he felt that his lie was caught.\nhe arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees. during a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets tyler durden (brad pitt), who is a soap salesman. tyler says that one can make all kinds of explosive using simple household items. the narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion, which is assessed to be a possible gas leak. the narrator calls marla but does not speak to her, and then calls tyler as he had his phone number from the flight.\nhe calls tyler and meets him at a bar. tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. the narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar.\ntyler works as a night shift projectionist at a movie theater splices single shot of pornographic films into regular family films being screened at the theater. he also works as a waiter at the pressman hotel, where he urinates into the soup and performs other degenerate acts on food items served to rich customers. the narrator moves into tyler's dilapidated house (the windows were boarded up, the stairs were about to collapse and there was no lock on the front door) and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the parking lot. after attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement.\nthe rules of the fight club include stuff like never talk about fight club, no shirt no shoes, a fight goes on for as long as it needs to, only 2 to a fight, one fight at a time, if you are new to fight club you have to fight and so on. marla contacts the narrator at his new phone number and wants to know why he hasn't been attending his support groups. the narrator says that he found a new one. that night the narrator has a dream about having sex with marla. but then he finds marla in the house, who just had sex with tyler. the narrator has no clue how marla got there and that confuses her, and she leaves in a huff. turns out marla had overdosed on xanax; she was rescued by tyler (the narrator had left the phone on the table while marla was talking and tyler picked it up and went to her room) and the two embark upon a sexual relationship. tyler makes the narrator promise never to talk about him with marla. under tyler's leadership, the fight club becomes \"project mayhem,\" which commits increasingly destructive acts of anti-capitalist vandalism in the city. the fight clubs become a network for a new underground organization, project mayhem, and the narrator is left out of tyler's activities with the project. after an argument, tyler disappears from the narrator's life and when a member of project mayhem dies on a mission, the narrator attempts to shut down the project. tracing tyler's steps, he travels around the country to find that fight clubs have been started in every major city, where one of the participants identifies the narrator as tyler durden. a phone call to marla confirms his identity and he realizes that tyler is the alter ego of his own split personality. tyler appears before him and explains that he controls the narrator's body whenever he is asleep and represents the narrator's basest urges: he is physically fit, assertive, aggressive, has a strong sexual prowess and is \"free in all the ways\" the narrator isn't. the narrator, overcome with the epiphany, faints and tyler disappears. the narrator awakes to find tyler has made several phone calls during his blackout and traces his plans to the downtown headquarters of several major credit card companies, which tyler intends to destroy in order to cripple the financial networks. tyler and the demolitions squad of project mayhem had wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.\nfailing to find help with the police, many of whom are members of project mayhem, the narrator attempts to disarm the explosives in the basement of one of the buildings. he is confronted by tyler, knocked unconscious after a lengthy fight, and taken to the upper floor of another building to witness the impending destruction. the narrator, held by tyler at gunpoint, realizes that, in sharing the same body with tyler, he is the one who is actually holding the gun. he fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. the illusion of tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head. shortly after, members of project mayhem bring a kidnapped marla to the narrator and leave them alone. the bombs detonate and, holding hands, the two witness the destruction of the entire financial city block through the windows."

      "too weak to cope with his dysfunctional existence, a disillusioned insomniac poses as a victim in late-night support groups for terminally ill patients. but everything changes when tyler durden steps into his mundane life. a rebellious spirit, tyler is an anarchist philosopher destined to become the unpredictable spark in the apathetic office worker's existence--a confident guide on the journey of self-discovery. as the feeble pencil-pusher discovers the gritty world of fight club, an underground sanctuary where men gather to free themselves from the constraints of a cruel modern reality, he finally sees that there is pleasure in pain. and what once felt like mere survival morphs into a thrilling revolution. now transformed into an urban warrior, the newcomer can challenge his demons and the society that confines him. after all, in this chaotic world, aren't violence and freedom two sides of the same coin?"

    "synopsis": [
      "in 1996, aboard the research vessel akademik mstislav keldysh, treasure hunter brock lovett (bill paxton) and his team explore the wreck of rms titanic, searching for a valuable diamond necklace called the heart of the ocean. the wreck rests on the ocean floor, 3821 meters below the surface.\nthey recover caledon \"cal\" hockley's (billy zane) safe, believing the necklace to be inside, but only find a sketch of a nude woman wearing the diamond, dated april 14, 1912, the night the titanic hit the iceberg. the expedition is privately funded and hence brock is under pressure to deliver the diamond to his investors.\nhearing about the drawing on the tv news, an elderly woman named rose dawson calvert (gloria stuart) calls lovett and claims that she is the woman depicted in the drawing. she and her granddaughter, lizzy calvert (suzy amis), visit him and his team on his salvage ship. rose is 101 years old and all the details about her convince brock that she was on the ship on the night of its accident. she was the last person who wore the heart of the ocean.\nbrock knows that cal's father nathan had settled an insurance claim for the loss of the diamond, that cal had bought for his fiance, just before the titanic sailed from england. brock takes rose through a quick simulation of the titanic iceberg collision. it hit the berg on the starboard side, which punched holes across a wide section of the hull. the water entered several water-tight compartments and eventually rose over the bulkheads (which did not go above the e deck) to spill over to the other water-tight compartments astern. the ship tilts as the stern rises out of the water and eventually splits into 2 parts right down the middle. the front section goes under first, followed shortly by the stern section. the ship sinks at 2:20 am, 2 hours and 40 minutes after the ship hit the iceberg.\nwhen asked if she knows the whereabouts of the necklace, rose recalls her time aboard the titanic, revealing that she is rose dewitt bukater, a passenger believed to have died in the sinking. she then begins her story as follows:\nin 1912, 17-year-old first class passenger rose (kate winslet) boards \"titanic\" in southampton with her fiance cal and her mother ruth dewitt bukater (frances fisher). titanic is making her first voyage and is considered to be \"unsinkable\".\nruth stresses the importance of rose's engagement, as the marriage would solve the dewitt bukaters' secret financial problems. meanwhile, jack and his italian friend fabrizio (danny nucci) board the titanic at the last possible minute by winning 3rd class tickets for the voyage in a poker game against irish immigrants.\nmargaret \"molly\" brown (kathy bates) boarded the ship at cherbourg. molly was looked down upon by the other first-class passengers for being \"new\" money.\nthe next day, titanic sails west at 21 knots. the titanic is captained by edward john smith (bernard hill) and was designed by thomas andrews (victor garber). edward's staff includes chief officer henry wilde (mark lindsay chapman), first officer william murdoch (ewan stewart), second officer charles lightoller (jonathan phillips) and third officer herbert pitman (kevin de la noy).\nj bruce ismay (jonathan hyde) is the md of the white star line, the owners of the titanic. distraught by her engagement, rose considers suicide by jumping off the ship's stern. rose climbs over the astern rails as she decides whether to jump. a drifter and artist named jack dawson (leonardo dicaprio) stops her and pulls her back on deck when she slips and hangs off the rails. discovered with jack on the stern, rose tells cal that she was looking over the ship's edge in curiosity and that jack saved her from falling.\nat rose's insistence, cal invites jack to dinner the following night to show his appreciation. that night cal gifts rose the heart of the ocean diamond, in a necklace.\nismay orders edwards to light the last 4 boilers of the titanic and speed the ship up, even though there were reports of icebergs on their route. ismay wanted to showcase the speed of the ship by arriving ahead of time in new york.\nrose notices that the ship is carrying only enough lifeboats for half the passengers on the ship. andrews says that an extra row of lifeboats would make the ship look cluttered and hence he was overruled. jack and rose develop a tentative friendship (and she learns that jack is a professional painter who specializes in painting nudes), even though cal and ruth are wary of the young third-class man. following the first-class dinner that night, rose secretly joins jack at a party in the ship's third-class quarter. they engage in some irish tap dancing and jack shows rose a mighty good time, where she gets to enjoy a hearty laugh for the first time in her life. cal and ruth forbid her to see jack (cal even hits rose when she attempts to stand up for herself), and rose attempts to rebuff jack's continuing advances. she soon realizes, though, that she prefers him over cal, and meets him at the bow of the ship during what turns out to be the titanic's final moments of daylight.\nthey then go to rose's stateroom, where she asks jack to sketch her while naked and wearing the heart of the ocean, cal's engagement present to her. afterward, the two evade cal's bodyguard spicer lovejoy (david warner) and make love inside a car in the ship's cargo hold.\ngoing afterwards to the ship's forward well deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg. due to the calm seas, the iceberg was detected very late, and then it took long for the ship to change direction to avoid collision. as a result, instead of hitting the berg head on (which would have been better for survival), the ship grazes the berg on its starboard side, and punches holes across the hull. the first officer closes all the watertight doors that go up to deck e.\njack and rose overhear the ship's officers and designer outline its seriousness. rose tells jack that they should warn her mother and cal.\nandrews says that 5 compartments of the ship are punctured (which is one compartment more punctured than what the ship was designed to stay afloat), which means the ship will sink. the ship has 2 hours at the most according to andrews. the ship has 2200 souls on board. the captain issues a distress call by the radio at their current coordinates. the nearest ship is 4 hours away. cal discovers jack's drawing and a mocking note from rose in his safe along with the necklace. cal reports the diamond stolen. furious, cal has his bodyguard slip the necklace into jack's coat pocket. accused of stealing it, jack is arrested, taken down to the master-at-arms' office and handcuffed to a pipe. cal puts the necklace in his coat. rose runs away from cal and her mother (who has boarded a lifeboat) and releases jack. the ship then starts to launch flares in order to attract any nearby ships.\nthe third-class passengers are not allowed on to the lifeboat decks and are locked below. meanwhile, lifeboats are launched half empty with only first-class passengers. once jack and rose reach the deck, cal and jack persuade her to board another lifeboat, cal claiming that he has arranged for himself and jack to get off safely. after she boards, cal tells jack that the arrangement is only for himself. as rose's boat lowers, she realizes that she cannot leave jack, and jumps back on board the titanic to reunite with him.\ninfuriated, cal takes a pistol and chases them into the flooding first-class dining saloon. after exhausting his ammunition, cal realizes to his chagrin that he gave his coat with the diamond to rose. with the situation now dire, he returns to the boat deck and boards a lifeboat by pretending to look after a lost child.\nthe engineers of the titanic are credited with keeping the lights on till the last possible moment. the musicians of the titanic were a septet orchestra who performed chamber music in the first-class section aboard the ship. the group is noted for playing music, intending to calm the passengers for as long as they possibly could, during the ship's sinking. jack and rose return to the top deck. all lifeboats have departed, and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. the ship breaks in half, and the stern side rises 90-degrees into the air. as it sinks, jack and rose ride the stern into the ocean. jack helps rose onto a wall panel only able to support one person's weight. holding the panel's edge, he assures her she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. meanwhile, fifth officer harold lowe has commandeered a lifeboat to search for survivors. he saves rose but is unable to reach jack before he dies from hypothermia. rose and the other survivors are taken by the rms carpathia to new york, where rose gives her name as rose dawson. she hides from cal on carpathia's deck as he searches for her. she learns later that he committed suicide after losing his fortune in the wall street crash of 1929. her story complete, rose goes alone to the stern of lovett's ship. there she takes out the heart of the ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the ocean.\nwhile seemingly asleep in her bed, the photos on her dresser are a visual chronicle that she lived a free life inspired by jack. the young rose is then seen reuniting with jack at the grand staircase of the rms titanic, applauded and congratulated by those who perished on the ship."

      "plot_summary": "In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett leads an expedition aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh to search the wreck of RMS Titanic, 3,821 meters below the Atlantic, hoping to recover the “Heart of the Ocean” diamond. They recover Caledon Hockley’s safe but only find a dated nude sketch of a woman wearing the necklace (April 14, 1912). An elderly Rose Dawson Calvert calls after seeing the sketch on television and visits with her granddaughter Lizzy; she claims to be the woman in the drawing and the last person who wore the diamond. Rose begins to recount her story in flashback.\n\nIn April 1912, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater boards Titanic in Southampton as a first-class passenger with her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, and her wealthy fiancé Caledon “Cal” Hockley. Ruth pressures Rose to marry Cal to solve the family’s financial problems and preserve their social standing. At the last minute, Jack Dawson, a penniless American artist, and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets in a poker game and board the ship.\n\nDepressed and feeling trapped, Rose attempts suicide by climbing over the stern rail, but Jack intervenes and saves her. To thank him, Cal invites Jack to dine with them; Jack endures the snobbery of Cal and Ruth. Jack and Rose develop a rapport: she slips away to join third-class passengers for dancing, laughs for the first time, and ultimately confides in Jack. Rose asks Jack to draw her nude wearing the Heart of the Ocean; he sketches her in his third-class space. Cal discovers the drawing and, enraged, has Jack arrested for stealing the necklace after Cal’s bodyguard Spicer Lovejoy plants the jewel on Jack.\n\nWhile Jack is handcuffed in the brig, Titanic strikes an iceberg. Ship designer Thomas Andrews and officers assess damage: five forward compartments are breached and the ship will sink within hours. Crew begin launching lifeboats; many lifeboats depart half full and third-class passengers are initially prevented from reaching the boat deck. Rose frees Jack, they evade Cal and Lovejoy, and hide together in a cargo hold where they make love in a parked car. As the ship’s condition worsens and lifeboats depart, Cal manipulates situations to separate himself from Jack and Rose; he later boards a lifeboat by deceit.\n\nRose, refusing to leave Jack, jumps back onto the sinking ship. The ship’s stern lifts, Titanic breaks in two, and the bow submerges. Jack and Rose are forced into the freezing ocean; Jack helps Rose onto a floating debris panel that supports only one person. He remains in the frigid water and dies of hypothermia after assuring Rose she will live to be an old woman. Fifth Officer Harold Lowe rescues Rose; survivors are taken aboard RMS Carpathia to New York. On Carpathia, Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson to hide from Cal. She later learns Cal lost his fortune and committed suicide after the 1929 crash.\n\nBack in 1996, Rose finishes her account and, alone on the Keldysh’s stern, reveals she possessed the Heart of the Ocean all along. She drops the diamond into the sea above Titanic’s wreckage. The film closes with a dreamlike reunion: an aged Rose lies asleep and the young Rose is reunited with Jack on Titanic’s grand staircase among those who perished.",

      "in 1996, aboard the research vessel akademik mstislav keldysh, treasure hunter brock lovett (bill paxton) and his team explore the wreck of rms titanic, searching for a valuable diamond necklace called the heart of the ocean. the wreck rests on the ocean floor, 3821 meters below the surface.\nthey recover caledon \"cal\" hockley's (billy zane) safe, believing the necklace to be inside, but only find a sketch of a nude woman wearing the diamond, dated april 14, 1912, the night the titanic hit the iceberg. the expedition is privately funded and hence brock is under pressure to deliver the diamond to his investors.\nhearing about the drawing on the tv news, an elderly woman named rose dawson calvert (gloria stuart) calls lovett and claims that she is the woman depicted in the drawing. she and her granddaughter, lizzy calvert (suzy amis), visit him and his team on his salvage ship. rose is 101 years old and all the details about her convince brock that she was on the ship on the night of its accident. she was the last person who wore the heart of the ocean.\nbrock knows that cal's father nathan had settled an insurance claim for the loss of the diamond, that cal had bought for his fiance, just before the titanic sailed from england. brock takes rose through a quick simulation of the titanic iceberg collision. it hit the berg on the starboard side, which punched holes across a wide section of the hull. the water entered several water-tight compartments and eventually rose over the bulkheads (which did not go above the e deck) to spill over to the other water-tight compartments astern. the ship tilts as the stern rises out of the water and eventually splits into 2 parts right down the middle. the front section goes under first, followed shortly by the stern section. the ship sinks at 2:20 am, 2 hours and 40 minutes after the ship hit the iceberg.\nwhen asked if she knows the whereabouts of the necklace, rose recalls her time aboard the titanic, revealing that she is rose dewitt bukater, a passenger believed to have died in the sinking. she then begins her story as follows:\nin 1912, 17-year-old first class passenger rose (kate winslet) boards \"titanic\" in southampton with her fiance cal and her mother ruth dewitt bukater (frances fisher). titanic is making her first voyage and is considered to be \"unsinkable\".\nruth stresses the importance of rose's engagement, as the marriage would solve the dewitt bukaters' secret financial problems. meanwhile, jack and his italian friend fabrizio (danny nucci) board the titanic at the last possible minute by winning 3rd class tickets for the voyage in a poker game against irish immigrants.\nmargaret \"molly\" brown (kathy bates) boarded the ship at cherbourg. molly was looked down upon by the other first-class passengers for being \"new\" money.\nthe next day, titanic sails west at 21 knots. the titanic is captained by edward john smith (bernard hill) and was designed by thomas andrews (victor garber). edward's staff includes chief officer henry wilde (mark lindsay chapman), first officer william murdoch (ewan stewart), second officer charles lightoller (jonathan phillips) and third officer herbert pitman (kevin de la noy).\nj bruce ismay (jonathan hyde) is the md of the white star line, the owners of the titanic. distraught by her engagement, rose considers suicide by jumping off the ship's stern. rose climbs over the astern rails as she decides whether to jump. a drifter and artist named jack dawson (leonardo dicaprio) stops her and pulls her back on deck when she slips and hangs off the rails. discovered with jack on the stern, rose tells cal that she was looking over the ship's edge in curiosity and that jack saved her from falling.\nat rose's insistence, cal invites jack to dinner the following night to show his appreciation. that night cal gifts rose the heart of the ocean diamond, in a necklace.\nismay orders edwards to light the last 4 boilers of the titanic and speed the ship up, even though there were reports of icebergs on their route. ismay wanted to showcase the speed of the ship by arriving ahead of time in new york.\nrose notices that the ship is carrying only enough lifeboats for half the passengers on the ship. andrews says that an extra row of lifeboats would make the ship look cluttered and hence he was overruled. jack and rose develop a tentative friendship (and she learns that jack is a professional painter who specializes in painting nudes), even though cal and ruth are wary of the young third-class man. following the first-class dinner that night, rose secretly joins jack at a party in the ship's third-class quarter. they engage in some irish tap dancing and jack shows rose a mighty good time, where she gets to enjoy a hearty laugh for the first time in her life. cal and ruth forbid her to see jack (cal even hits rose when she attempts to stand up for herself), and rose attempts to rebuff jack's continuing advances. she soon realizes, though, that she prefers him over cal, and meets him at the bow of the ship during what turns out to be the titanic's final moments of daylight.\nthey then go to rose's stateroom, where she asks jack to sketch her while naked and wearing the heart of the ocean, cal's engagement present to her. afterward, the two evade cal's bodyguard spicer lovejoy (david warner) and make love inside a car in the ship's cargo hold.\ngoing afterwards to the ship's forward well deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg. due to the calm seas, the iceberg was detected very late, and then it took long for the ship to change direction to avoid collision. as a result, instead of hitting the berg head on (which would have been better for survival), the ship grazes the berg on its starboard side, and punches holes across the hull. the first officer closes all the watertight doors that go up to deck e.\njack and rose overhear the ship's officers and designer outline its seriousness. rose tells jack that they should warn her mother and cal.\nandrews says that 5 compartments of the ship are punctured (which is one compartment more punctured than what the ship was designed to stay afloat), which means the ship will sink. the ship has 2 hours at the most according to andrews. the ship has 2200 souls on board. the captain issues a distress call by the radio at their current coordinates. the nearest ship is 4 hours away. cal discovers jack's drawing and a mocking note from rose in his safe along with the necklace. cal reports the diamond stolen. furious, cal has his bodyguard slip the necklace into jack's coat pocket. accused of stealing it, jack is arrested, taken down to the master-at-arms' office and handcuffed to a pipe. cal puts the necklace in his coat. rose runs away from cal and her mother (who has boarded a lifeboat) and releases jack. the ship then starts to launch flares in order to attract any nearby ships.\nthe third-class passengers are not allowed on to the lifeboat decks and are locked below. meanwhile, lifeboats are launched half empty with only first-class passengers. once jack and rose reach the deck, cal and jack persuade her to board another lifeboat, cal claiming that he has arranged for himself and jack to get off safely. after she boards, cal tells jack that the arrangement is only for himself. as rose's boat lowers, she realizes that she cannot leave jack, and jumps back on board the titanic to reunite with him.\ninfuriated, cal takes a pistol and chases them into the flooding first-class dining saloon. after exhausting his ammunition, cal realizes to his chagrin that he gave his coat with the diamond to rose. with the situation now dire, he returns to the boat deck and boards a lifeboat by pretending to look after a lost child.\nthe engineers of the titanic are credited with keeping the lights on till the last possible moment. the musicians of the titanic were a septet orchestra who performed chamber music in the first-class section aboard the ship. the group is noted for playing music, intending to calm the passengers for as long as they possibly could, during the ship's sinking. jack and rose return to the top deck. all lifeboats have departed, and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. the ship breaks in half, and the stern side rises 90-degrees into the air. as it sinks, jack and rose ride the stern into the ocean. jack helps rose onto a wall panel only able to support one person's weight. holding the panel's edge, he assures her she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. meanwhile, fifth officer harold lowe has commandeered a lifeboat to search for survivors. he saves rose but is unable to reach jack before he dies from hypothermia. rose and the other survivors are taken by the rms carpathia to new york, where rose gives her name as rose dawson. she hides from cal on carpathia's deck as he searches for her. she learns later that he committed suicide after losing his fortune in the wall street crash of 1929. her story complete, rose goes alone to the stern of lovett's ship. there she takes out the heart of the ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the ocean.\nwhile seemingly asleep in her bed, the photos on her dresser are a visual chronicle that she lived a free life inspired by jack. the young rose is then seen reuniting with jack at the grand staircase of the rms titanic, applauded and congratulated by those who perished on the ship."

      "the movie forrest gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. gump faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. from wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average iq and even being shot, gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. while several less than ideal things occur during gump's life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. this skill allows gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability. while gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend jenny curran. the movie is centered on forrest gump and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of jenny and how important she is to him. although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. this upsets gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other's lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the reflection pond in d.c. even though gump is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of curran and the hardships she faces.",

    "synopsis": [
      "in 1981, at a bus stop in savannah, georgia, a man named forrest gump (tom hanks) recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench. forrest offers them chocolates from a box and says that his mother used to say, \"life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get\". in 1951, in greenbow, alabama, young forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine and is unable to walk properly, even though he had very strong legs.\nforrest gump was named after nathan bedford forrest, a confederate general and the first grand wizard of the ku klux klan. forrest's mother named him after this ancestor, possibly to remind him that \"sometimes we all do things that just don't make no sense\".\nforrest's mother instills a sense of pride in him and is adamant not to let anyone tell forrest that they are better than him. he lives alone with his mother (sally field), who runs a boarding house out of their home (which was a large estate that had been in their family for several generations) that attracts many tenants, including a young elvis presley (peter dobson), who plays the guitar for forrest and incorporates forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. on his first day of school, forrest meets a girl named jenny curran (robin wright) on the bus. jenny offered her a seat when nobody else would, and the two become best friends. they were together all the time. jenny helped forrest and taught him how to read. forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. at an early age he is deemed to have a below-average iq of 75. forrest is denied admission in the normal school and his mother sleeps with the school principal (sam anderson) to make sure he is not sent to the gifted school. jenny encourages forrest to run when he encounters bullies in the field. while fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing forrest to be a very fast runner. jenny's mother passed away when she was 5. it is implied that jenny is being sexually assaulted as a kid by her father. she is eventually removed from his custody and given to her grandmother. forrest's talent in running fast eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the university of alabama in 1963, where he is coached by bear bryant (sonny shroyer). he witnesses governor george wallace's stand in the schoolhouse door (when he was protesting the federal order to allow african american kids at the university). at the same protest, forrest returns a dropped book to vivian malone jones (one of the first african american students to be allowed into the university). forrest becomes a top kick returner, is named on the all-american team, and meets president john f. kennedy at the white house.\njenny studies at a girls' only college and forrest unknowingly interferes with her life when he beats up her lovers who try to take advantage of her. jenny tells forrest that he would not be around always to protect her. jenny takes forrest to her room and gets him to touch her breasts, due to which he ejaculates prematurely. after graduating college in 1967, forrest enlists into the u.s. army. during basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed \"bubba\" (mykelti williamson), who convinces forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. bubba family had been catching and serving shrimp for several generations and knew everything about the business.\njenny is expelled from college after her topless photos make it to playboy. because of the spread, she gets a job singing topless in a memphis bar. forrest goes to meet her and tells her that he loves her. jenny says that forrest doesn't know what love is and tells forrest to stay away from her. in 1968, bubba and forrest are sent to vietnam, serving with the 9th infantry division in the mekong delta region. after months of routine operations, forrest learns the value of good personal hygiene and to change socks every chance they get. forrest got to see a lot of the countryside on his patrols, and he was confused that they were always looking for this guy named charlie. there was always someplace to go and forrest was asked to check out a lot of fox holes used by the enemy to hide. it rained a lot for 4 straight months. forrest saw every kind of rain there is, stinging rain, big old fat rain, rain that came from the side and even rain that seemed to come from the ground up. forrest wrote a lot of letters to jenny, but she never replied. their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and bubba is killed in action. forrest saves several wounded platoon mates-including his lieutenant, dan taylor (gary sinise). forrest carries the wounded men from the battle zone on his back and to safety. dan resisted but forrest carried him away regardless. dan is forrest and bubba blue's platoon leader during the vietnam war, whose ancestors have died in every u.s. war and who regards it as his destiny to do the same.\ndan loses both his legs-and is awarded the medal of honor for his heroism by president lyndon b. johnson. during the rescues, gump was hit in the buttocks by a bullet that jumped up. he was sent back stateside for r&r. he gets to eat a lot of ice cream. lt dan is recovering right next to gump but hates him for saving his life. while at the hospital, gump is introduced to ping pong. at the anti-war \"march on the pentagon\" rally, forrest meets a man who \"had an american flag for a shirt\" and briefly reunites with jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. gump hits men who mistreat jenny. he gives her his medal of honor, as he got it for doing what she told her to do. he also develops a talent for ping-pong and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside john lennon on the dick cavett show. forrest spends the holidays and the 1972 new year in new york city with lieutenant dan, who has become bitter due to the loss of his legs. forrest soon meets president richard nixon (as part of the us ping pong team) and is put up in the watergate complex, where he accidentally witnesses and reports some men with flashlights in the building across the street that's keeping him awake (alluding to the watergate scandal). forrest is eventually discharged from the army. returning to greenbow, forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles (for $25k). he uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in bayou la batre, fulfilling his promise to bubba. lieutenant dan joins forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. after their boat becomes the only one to survive hurricane carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the bubba gump shrimp company, after which lieutenant dan finally thanks forrest for saving his life. lieutenant dan invests into what forrest thinks is \"some kind of fruit company\" (apple) and the two become millionaires, but forrest also gives half of the earnings to bubba's family. forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of cancer. in 1976, jenny-in the middle of recovering from years of drugs and abuse-returns to visit forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. that night she tells forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. heartbroken, forrest goes running and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again. he eventually decides that he's grown tired of running (metaphorically and physically) and returns home to greenbow. back in 1981, forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from jenny, who asked him to visit her. as forrest is finally reunited with jenny, she introduces him to their son, named forrest gump, jr. jenny tells forrest she is sick with an unknown disease implied to be hepatitis c and the three move back to greenbow. jenny and forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. the film ends with forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school."

He begins in 1951 Greenbow, Alabama: born to Mrs. Gump, Forrest wears leg braces as a child and meets Jenny Curran on the school bus; Jenny becomes his closest friend and teacher. Bullies pursue him; when he runs away his leg braces break and he discovers he can run extremely fast. Mrs. Gump runs a boardinghouse and insists Forrest be treated like any other boy; she prevents the school from sending him away. Forrest earns a football scholarship to the University of Alabama under coach Bear Bryant, where he returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone during Governor George Wallace's integration stand. After college, Forrest unknowingly interferes in parts of Jenny’s life and later enlists in the U.S. Army in 1967. In basic he befriends Benjamin “Bubba” Blue, who teaches him about shrimping and vows a shrimping business. In Vietnam Forrest saves many platoon members during an ambush, carrying wounded soldiers to safety; Bubba is killed and Lieutenant Dan Taylor loses his legs. Forrest is wounded and sent home. President Lyndon B. Johnson awards Lieutenant Dan a medal of honor; Dan resents Forrest for saving him. Forrest learns ping-pong in the hospital and becomes a national ping-pong celebrity, playing in China and appearing on TV. At an anti-war rally he briefly reunites with Jenny, who rebukes him and later drifts through a life of drugs and abuse. Forrest accidentally witnesses suspicious men in the Watergate complex while staying there with the U.S. ping-pong team and reports them. Discharged, Forrest uses money earned endorsing ping-pong paddles to buy a shrimp boat in Bayou La Batre to fulfill Bubba’s dream. Lieutenant Dan partners with him; after Hurricane Carmen destroys other boats, their catch makes the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company successful. Dan, who had suffered bitterness and alcoholism, accepts Forrest’s help and later invests their profits in Apple, making them wealthy; Forrest gives half the money to Bubba’s family. Forrest returns home to care for his dying mother, who dies of cancer. In 1976 Jenny returns briefly; Forrest proposes, they have sex, and she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest runs across the country for three years before stopping and returning to Greenbow. Back in 1981 Jenny contacts Forrest; he visits her in Mobile where she reveals they have a son, Forrest Jr., and that she is ill (implied hepatitis C). They marry and move to Greenbow; Jenny dies a year later. The story ends with Forrest taking his son to his first day of school and watching him board the school bus.",

      "in 1981, at a bus stop in savannah, georgia, a man named forrest gump (tom hanks) recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench. forrest offers them chocolates from a box and says that his mother used to say, \"life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get\". in 1951, in greenbow, alabama, young forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine and is unable to walk properly, even though he had very strong legs.\nforrest gump was named after nathan bedford forrest, a confederate general and the first grand wizard of the ku klux klan. forrest's mother named him after this ancestor, possibly to remind him that \"sometimes we all do things that just don't make no sense\".\nforrest's mother instills a sense of pride in him and is adamant not to let anyone tell forrest that they are better than him. he lives alone with his mother (sally field), who runs a boarding house out of their home (which was a large estate that had been in their family for several generations) that attracts many tenants, including a young elvis presley (peter dobson), who plays the guitar for forrest and incorporates forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. on his first day of school, forrest meets a girl named jenny curran (robin wright) on the bus. jenny offered her a seat when nobody else would, and the two become best friends. they were together all the time. jenny helped forrest and taught him how to read. forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. at an early age he is deemed to have a below-average iq of 75. forrest is denied admission in the normal school and his mother sleeps with the school principal (sam anderson) to make sure he is not sent to the gifted school. jenny encourages forrest to run when he encounters bullies in the field. while fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing forrest to be a very fast runner. jenny's mother passed away when she was 5. it is implied that jenny is being sexually assaulted as a kid by her father. she is eventually removed from his custody and given to her grandmother. forrest's talent in running fast eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the university of alabama in 1963, where he is coached by bear bryant (sonny shroyer). he witnesses governor george wallace's stand in the schoolhouse door (when he was protesting the federal order to allow african american kids at the university). at the same protest, forrest returns a dropped book to vivian malone jones (one of the first african american students to be allowed into the university). forrest becomes a top kick returner, is named on the all-american team, and meets president john f. kennedy at the white house.\njenny studies at a girls' only college and forrest unknowingly interferes with her life when he beats up her lovers who try to take advantage of her. jenny tells forrest that he would not be around always to protect her. jenny takes forrest to her room and gets him to touch her breasts, due to which he ejaculates prematurely. after graduating college in 1967, forrest enlists into the u.s. army. during basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed \"bubba\" (mykelti williamson), who convinces forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. bubba family had been catching and serving shrimp for several generations and knew everything about the business.\njenny is expelled from college after her topless photos make it to playboy. because of the spread, she gets a job singing topless in a memphis bar. forrest goes to meet her and tells her that he loves her. jenny says that forrest doesn't know what love is and tells forrest to stay away from her. in 1968, bubba and forrest are sent to vietnam, serving with the 9th infantry division in the mekong delta region. after months of routine operations, forrest learns the value of good personal hygiene and to change socks every chance they get. forrest got to see a lot of the countryside on his patrols, and he was confused that they were always looking for this guy named charlie. there was always someplace to go and forrest was asked to check out a lot of fox holes used by the enemy to hide. it rained a lot for 4 straight months. forrest saw every kind of rain there is, stinging rain, big old fat rain, rain that came from the side and even rain that seemed to come from the ground up. forrest wrote a lot of letters to jenny, but she never replied. their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and bubba is killed in action. forrest saves several wounded platoon mates-including his lieutenant, dan taylor (gary sinise). forrest carries the wounded men from the battle zone on his back and to safety. dan resisted but forrest carried him away regardless. dan is forrest and bubba blue's platoon leader during the vietnam war, whose ancestors have died in every u.s. war and who regards it as his destiny to do the same.\ndan loses both his legs-and is awarded the medal of honor for his heroism by president lyndon b. johnson. during the rescues, gump was hit in the buttocks by a bullet that jumped up. he was sent back stateside for r&r. he gets to eat a lot of ice cream. lt dan is recovering right next to gump but hates him for saving his life. while at the hospital, gump is introduced to ping pong. at the anti-war \"march on the pentagon\" rally, forrest meets a man who \"had an american flag for a shirt\" and briefly reunites with jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. gump hits men who mistreat jenny. he gives her his medal of honor, as he got it for doing what she told her to do. he also develops a talent for ping-pong and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside john lennon on the dick cavett show. forrest spends the holidays and the 1972 new year in new york city with lieutenant dan, who has become bitter due to the loss of his legs. forrest soon meets president richard nixon (as part of the us ping pong team) and is put up in the watergate complex, where he accidentally witnesses and reports some men with flashlights in the building across the street that's keeping him awake (alluding to the watergate scandal). forrest is eventually discharged from the army. returning to greenbow, forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles (for $25k). he uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in bayou la batre, fulfilling his promise to bubba. lieutenant dan joins forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. after their boat becomes the only one to survive hurricane carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the bubba gump shrimp company, after which lieutenant dan finally thanks forrest for saving his life. lieutenant dan invests into what forrest thinks is \"some kind of fruit company\" (apple) and the two become millionaires, but forrest also gives half of the earnings to bubba's family. forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of cancer. in 1976, jenny-in the middle of recovering from years of drugs and abuse-returns to visit forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. that night she tells forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. heartbroken, forrest goes running and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again. he eventually decides that he's grown tired of running (metaphorically and physically) and returns home to greenbow. back in 1981, forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from jenny, who asked him to visit her. as forrest is finally reunited with jenny, she introduces him to their son, named forrest gump, jr. jenny tells forrest she is sick with an unknown disease implied to be hepatitis c and the three move back to greenbow. jenny and forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. the film ends with forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school."

      "forrest gump is a simple man with a low i.q. but good intentions. he is running through childhood with his best and only friend jenny. his 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. forrest joins the army for service in vietnam, finding new friends called dan and bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. however, this is all irrelevant to forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart jenny curran, who has messed up her life. although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.",
      "the movie forrest gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. gump faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. from wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average iq and even being shot, gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. while several less than ideal things occur during gump's life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. this skill allows gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability. while gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend jenny curran. the movie is centered on forrest gump and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of jenny and how important she is to him. although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. this upsets gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other's lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the reflection pond in d.c. even though gump is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of curran and the hardships she faces.",
      "slow-witted forrest gump has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother, he leads anything but a restricted life. whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. but one person forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled jenny.",
      "forrest gump, an innocent and kind-hearted alabama boy, has been dealing with other people's unkindness nearly all his life. having grown up with beautiful jenny, his only friend, forrest yearns to learn all about the ways of the world and embarks on a mission to find his true purpose in life. thrust into downright extraordinary situations, forrest finds himself present at some of the most pivotal events in the second half of the 20th century, rubbing shoulders with influential and historical figures, including john f. kennedy , richard nixon , a nice young man from england named john lennon , and even a handsome but still unknown elvis presley . throughout his existence, forrest has been encountering life's randomness; however, in this earth, no one is insignificant. with his presence alone, one builds his own place in this world, unknowingly changing the flow of things, while fate floats like a feather in the wind. but, in this life-altering journey, is forrest meant to find his destiny, and be with jenny?"

      "plot_summary": "In 1990s Seoul, twelve-year-olds Na‑young and Hae‑sung are close classmates and first loves who imagine marrying each other. Na‑young’s parents emigrate to Canada; the family later moves to New York. Na‑young adopts the name Nora Moon and pursues theater, eventually becoming a successful playwright. Hae‑sung completes engineering school in Korea, serves briefly in the military, and starts working in Seoul. The two lose regular contact but reconnect intermittently over the internet and video chat as adults, sharing memories and the emotional bond from their youth.\n\nIn present‑day New York, Nora is married to Arthur, an American architect. Hae‑sung arranges to visit and the three meet at a bar: Nora, Hae‑sung, and Arthur. Nora and Hae‑sung spend a week together rekindling intimacy—walking the city, sharing meals, and talking late into the night—while Arthur remains physically present but increasingly outside their private world. Nora and Hae‑sung discuss their twelve‑year‑old promises, the lives they built apart, and the persistent feeling that their connection was never exhausted. Hae‑sung confesses long‑held longing; Nora is moved, torn between the nostalgic certainty of that childhood bond and her commitments in New York.\n\nNora and Hae‑sung have sex during the visit; afterward they confront the consequences. Arthur senses the shift and eventually faces the truth of Nora’s emotional distance. Hae‑sung returns to Seoul after the week, leaving both adults to reckon with what the reunion did to their lives. Nora and Arthur attempt to continue their marriage in New York, but the intimacy between Nora and Hae‑sung lingers as a defining rupture.\n\nYears later, Nora and Hae‑sung exchange messages across time zones but never recreate that week. Hae‑sung marries a Korean woman and has a family in Seoul; Nora stays in New York with Arthur. The film ends with an older Nora in New York and Hae‑sung in Seoul, each keeping the memory of that week and the twelve‑year‑old selves who believed in fate—acknowledging that their lives followed different, irreversible paths even as the emotional truth of their bond remains.",

businesses and force them to wear blue star of david armbands.\nwladek meets with dorota, who accompanies him around warsaw to learn of the injustice hebrew people have to face under the new nazi regime. businesses that were once friendly to them now won't allow their patronage. wladek's father is harshly forbidden to walk on the sidewalk in the city by two german officers; when he begins to protest, one of the officers hits him in the face.\nszpilman and his family sell many of their material belongings, including his piano, in order to make enough zlotys to survive. by november 1940,

starvation rampant. szpilman finds work by performing in a cafe frequented by upper-class hebrews, who smuggle in forbidden goods in order to live comfortably. on one occasion, he sees a young boy

survived. the aged father must apply for working papers through a friend of wladek's, so that he can take a job in a german clothier.\non 16 august 1942 the family are deported to treblinka extermination camp. henryk and halina are selected and taken away and the rest of the family is sent to the umschlagplatz to wait for transport. the father uses the family's last 20 zlotys to buy a piece of candy from a boy. each family member eats a tiny morsel of candy, their last meal together. at the umschlagplatz, szpilman is about to board the train when a friend from the hebrew ghetto police separates him away from his family and allows him to escape. szpilman is unable to save the rest of his family, and they are sent away to the camps. szpilman becomes a slave laborer and learns of a coming hebrew revolt. he hides for a few days in the cafe he played piano in with his old boss there. he later blends in with the ten percent or so of the hebrews that the nazis kept alive in the ghetto to use for slave labor, tearing down the brick walls separating the ghetto and rebuilding apartment houses for new, non-hebrew residents. he helps by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. after this close call, he decides he must escape and take his chances in the larger city. he then manages to escape and goes into hiding with help from non-hebrew friend andrzej bogucki (ronan vibert) and his wife janina (ruth platt). they take wladyslaw to his caretaker gebczynski (a man with the polish resistance), who hides him for one night. the next day gebczynski takes him to a vacant apartment near the ghetto wall, where he can live indefinitely on smuggled food. he must be silent however, since several non-hebrews also live in the building and believe the apartment is empty. in april 1943 szpilman observes from his window the warsaw ghetto uprising he aided and its ultimate failure.\nlater, gebczynski wants to move wladek as the nazis have found the weapons of the polish resistance, forcing gebczynski to be on the run also. gebczynski says it's only a matter of time before the nazis find the apartment wladek is hiding in. wladek decides to stay put, feeling safer where he is. his friend gives him an address to go to in case of an emergency, and leaves, gravely warning wladek not to be caught alive by the nazis. wladyslaw remains in the apartment a few more months until he has an accident, breaking some dishes. the noise has blown his cover, and he has to scurry out of the building, being chased by an angry german woman who suspects him of being hebrew. wladek goes to the emergency address he was given and meets his old friend dorota (emilia fox), whose husband provides him with another hiding place in the middle of the german quarter. he is shown into a room with a piano yet is compelled to keep quiet. his new caretaker, szalas, is very slack about smuggling in food, and wladyslaw once more faces starvation, while beginning to suffer from jaundice. dorota and her husband visit szpilman for the last time, providing him with a doctor to treat his illness. they report that szalas had been collecting money from generous and unwitting donors and had pocketed it all, leaving wladek to die in isolation. in august 1944, the polish resistance attack a german building across the street from szpilman's hideout during the warsaw uprising. the poles tried to retake control of their city. soon the germans start attacking the building and he has to flee. the poles had expected the advancing soviet red army to help them, but the russians did not come, instead allowing the germans to put down the revolt, and drive the entire remaining population of warsaw out of the city. a tank shells his apartment, forcing him to escape and hide elsewhere. the home army attacks the schutzpolizei hospital across the street from the apartment, while szpilman's apartment building is destroyed in the fighting, forcing him to flee and hide in the now abandoned hospital. the germans had by then decided to burn warsaw to ashes, so wladyslaw flees the hospital and jumps back over the wall into the ghetto, now an abandoned, desolate wasteland of bricks and rubble.\nover the course of the next months, the city is destroyed and abandoned, leaving szpilman alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. szpilman wanders through the city's ruins. he eventually makes his way to an abandoned home where he finds a can of pickles. while trying to open it he is discovered by the wehrmacht officer wilm hosenfeld (thomas kretschmann), who learns that szpilman is a pianist and asks him to play on a grand piano in the house. the decrepit szpilman plays chopin's ballade in g minor, which moves hosenfeld enough to allow szpilman to hide in the attic of the empty house where the german captain regularly brings him food. in january 1945, the germans are forced to retreat due to the advance of the red army. hosenfeld meets szpilman for the last time and promises he will listen to him on polish radio after the war. he gives szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm and leaves. however, this has almost fatal consequences for szpilman when he is mistaken for a german officer and shot at by polish troops liberating warsaw, who then apprehend and save him. in spring 1945, former inmates of a nazi concentration camp pass a soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured german soldiers and verbally abuse them. hosenfeld, among those captured, overhears a released inmate lament over his former career as a violinist. he asks the violinist if he knows szpilman, which the violinist confirms. hosenfeld wishes for szpilman to return the favor and help release him. sometime later, the violinist is able to bring szpilman back to the site, but they find it has been long abandoned. later, szpilman performs chopin's grand polonaise brillante to a large and prestigious audience. an epilogue states that szpilman died at the age of 88 in the year 2000, while hosenfeld died in soviet captivity in 1952, seven long years after the war had officially ended."

      "plot_summary": "In September 1939, Wladyslaw Szpilman, a celebrated Polish-Jewish pianist, is playing live on Warsaw radio when the station is bombed during Germany's invasion of Poland. He returns home to the Szpilman family apartment in Warsaw to find the city under occupation. The family initially hopes the war will pass; anti-Jewish restrictions soon escalate: Jews are forced from jobs, must wear identifying armbands, and are pushed into poverty. By November 1940 the Szpilmans are forced into the overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto. Wladyslaw finds work playing in a ghetto cafe and witnesses brutality and starvation in the streets, including the killing of a neighbor's family and a child’s death at the wall.\n\nOn 16 August 1942 the family is rounded up for deportation to Treblinka. At the Umschlagplatz Wladyslaw is separated from his family when a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police pulls him aside and allows him to slip away; his parents and siblings are sent to the extermination camp and he cannot save them. Szpilman becomes a slave laborer and helps smuggle weapons into the ghetto prior to the 1943 uprising. After narrowly avoiding arrest during resistance operations, he escapes the ghetto with help from non-Jewish friends Andrzej and Janina Bogucki and the caretaker Gebczynski, who hides him in an ostensibly empty apartment near the ghetto wall and supplies smuggled food. He watches the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising from his window as the insurgents are crushed.\n\nWhen the apartment’s network is compromised, Gebczynski moves on and warns Szpilman to flee. Szpilman later breaks dishes, alerting neighbors and forcing him to run to an emergency address given by Gebczynski. Dorota, an acquaintance, arranges new concealment in the German quarter with a caretaker named Szalas; there is a piano but scarce food. Szalas pockets donations and neglects Szpilman, who falls ill with jaundice. Dorota and her husband secure a doctor, but Szpilman remains isolated.\n\nIn August 1944 the Polish Home Army begins the Warsaw Uprising; fighting and German reprisals destroy large parts of the city. Szpilman’s building is shelled and he flees through ruins and bombed buildings, eventually hiding in an abandoned hospital and later slipping back into the gutted, empty ghetto. Over ensuing months he scavenges for food and shelter among the ruins of Warsaw.\n\nOne day he is discovered while trying to open a jar of pickles by Wehrmacht officer Captain Wilm Hosenfeld. Hosenfeld learns Szpilman is a pianist and, moved when Szpilman plays Chopin on a ruined grand piano, spares him, brings food, and shelters him in an attic. In January 1945, as the Red Army approaches and Germans retreat, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his greatcoat and promises to listen for him on Polish radio; they part. Soon after, Polish soldiers mistake Szpilman (wearing the coat) for a German and shoot at him; they then apprehend and save him. After the war Szpilman returns to life as a musician and performs publicly, including a triumphant Chopin Polonaise. An epilogue notes Szpilman lived to age 88 (died 2000) and Hosenfeld died in Soviet captivity in 1952.",

      "filmmaker roman polanski, who as a boy growing up in poland watched while the nazis devastated his country during world war ii, directed this downbeat drama based on the story of a privileged musician who spent five years struggling against the nazi occupation of warsaw. wladyslaw szpilman (adrien brody) is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy jewish family in poland. the szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in warsaw which wladyslaw shares with his mother and father (maureen lipman and frank finlay), his sisters halina and regina (jessica kate meyer and julia rayner), and his brother, henryk (ed stoppard). while wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of german forces and hitler's designs on poland, they're convinced that the nazis are a menace which will pass, and that england and france will step forward to aid poland in the event of a real crisis. wladyslaw's naivete is shattered when a german bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. during the early stages of the nazi occupation, as a respected artist, he still imagines himself above the danger, using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. but as the german grip tightens upon poland, wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a nazi concentration camp. refusing to face a certain death, wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. however, when his benefactor goes missing, wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another, desperate to avoid capture by german occupation troops.",
      "a jewish pianist named wladislaw szpilman was playing the piano on the radio station when an explosion occurred outside. it was the beginning of german nazi occupation in polland. when he returned home, his family was arguing over how they could keep the rest of their money so the german's couldn't see it. when they looked out the window, they saw their area was fenced. since then, their life has become in a difficult situation. the german's deported his family and forcibly took on train way to concentration camp. szpilman was left behind in the warsaw ghetto and struggled alone for survival.",

      "plot_summary": "In a modern-day nursing home on Seabrook Island, an elderly man who calls himself Duke (James Garner) reads daily from a leather-bound notebook to an elderly woman, Allie, who has advanced dementia. He reads a long first-person account of a 1940s romance. In 1940 Seabrook Island, South Carolina, 17-year-old heiress Allison “Allie” Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) attends a county fair where poor lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) pursues her; after threatening to jump from a Ferris wheel he coerces her into a date. They rapidly fall in love that summer, spending days swimming, dancing, and planning a future. Noah shows Allie an abandoned Windsor Plantation house he intends to restore; she outlines specific desires for “their” house (white with blue shutters, water view, a wraparound porch).\n\nAllie’s parents, particularly her mother Anne Hamilton (Joan Allen), disapprove of Noah’s class and forbid the relationship. After a fight in which Allie impulsively breaks up with Noah, Allie’s family unexpectedly moves back to Charleston. Noah writes to Allie every day for a year (365 letters) but her mother intercepts them; when his letters go unanswered Noah stops writing and enlists with his friend Fin (Chris and Kevin Connolly alternate casts—Fin portrayed by Kevin Connolly) to fight in World War II. In Europe Noah fights at the Battle of the Bulge; Fin is killed.\n\nAllie volunteers in a military hospital and meets Captain Lon Hammond Jr. (James Marsden), a well-born lawyer; they become engaged with her parents’ blessing. After the war Noah returns, buys and restores the Windsor house to Allie’s specifications and refuses to sell it. Allie sees a newspaper photograph of the finished house, persuades Lon to let her take a short trip, and returns to Seabrook to find Noah living there. Noah and Allie rekindle their relationship and make love; Noah reveals he wrote to her every day and that her mother hid the letters. Anne later arrives and warns that Lon has come to Seabrook and confesses she once loved a lower-class man herself.\n\nAllie, overwhelmed, drives away in confusion. Anne then gives Allie the hidden letters as a confession. Allie tells Lon the truth and breaks the engagement; she returns to Noah and they marry. The notebook’s narrative continues describing their married life and children.\n\nIn the present, “Duke” is revealed to be Noah, and the notebook is the story Allie wrote early in her dementia so Noah could read it to her and help her remember. Noah reads to her nearly every day to bring her back briefly; at one point she recognizes him, they dance to their song “I’ll Be Seeing You,” and she remembers their children for a few minutes. Her dementia then relapses, she panics and is sedated; Noah, distraught, suffers a heart attack and is hospitalized. Both are later in the same hospital’s dementia ward; Noah visits Allie at night, reminds her of their love, and while they sleep together they die in each other’s arms. A nurse discovers their bodies in the morning.",

(james marsden), a young lawyer who comes from old southern money. after a few years being together, the two become engaged to the delight of allie's parents. when noah returns from the war, his father has sold their home so that noah can buy the abandoned house. while visiting charleston, noah witnesses allie and lon kissing at a restaurant; he convinces himself that if he restores the house, allie will come back to him. once it's completed, noah resists selling it.\nlater, while allie is being fitted for her wedding dress, allie is startled to see in the newspaper that noah has completed the house to the specifications she made years before. after allie asks permission from lon to take a little trip before the wedding, allie returns to seabrook to find noah living in the restored house. the two renew their relationship and make love. noah tells allie about the 365 letters, and they realize her mother kept them from her. several days later, anne appears in the morning on noah's doorstep to warn allie that lon has followed her to seabrook. she also reveals that she once loved a lower-class young man in town and still wonders how changed their lives would have been if she had chosen differently.\nnoah and allie argue and he tells her to decide what she wants, not what everyone else does. she drives back to her hotel, sobbing and confused.\nanne then gives allie the letters that noah wrote to her as an admission that she had hidden them from allie. subsequently, allie confesses to lon that she had spent time with noah, and eventually returns to her relationship with noah. in the present narrative, it is revealed that the elderly woman is dementia-stricken allie (gena rowlands), duke is actually noah, who uses a pseudonym to not startle her in her disoriented state. the journal he reads to her she wrote during the early stages of her illness, detailing their romance and life together so he could help her come back to him. noah has kept the promise to read it to her almost daily. almost at the end of the journal in the notebook, allie asks noah what happened at the end of the story and noah prompts her that she knows. she briefly recognizes him and remembers. allie asks how long they have before she forgets again and duke tells her possibly five minutes. they dance to their song, \"i'll be seeing you\", and she asks about their kids. however, allie's dementia quickly relapses and she panics to see a stranger touching her, so is sedated. noah suffers a heart attack and is sent to the hospital while allie is sent to a dementia ward in the same hospital. noah visits allie's room in the middle of the night causing her to remember him again and proceeds to remind her of her illness, though he reassures her that they can do anything with the love they share. while sleeping, both noah and allie pass away in each other's arms and a nurse discovers them in the morning."

      "with almost religious devotion, duke, a kind octogenarian inmate of a peaceful nursing home, reads daily a captivating story from the worn-out pages of his leather-bound notebook to a fellow female patient. to keep her company, duke recounts the fascinating love affair between impecunious but poetic country boy noah and allie, an affluent city girl. and little by little, duke unfolds a southern, lumber-scented summer romance beneath the tall trees of late 1930s north carolina. indeed, it seems as if the silent manuscript possesses the unfathomable power to penetrate the opaque clouds that enclose the silver-haired dame; slowly but surely, the enchanted lady becomes immersed in the strangely alluring fairy tale of the young ardent lovers' highs and lows. but nobody knows what tomorrow holds. are all summer loves doomed to fail?",
      "an elderly man recounts the love story of a young couple from different social backgrounds. their relationship faces challenges of family, society, and time. the narrative reflects on memory, enduring love, and the impact of life choices on personal relationships.",
      "born from a fleeting summer and carried through a lifetime, the notebook tells the story of a love so powerful it refuses to fade. noah and allie fall deeply and fiercely in love, only to be torn apart by circumstance, time, and the expectations of the world around them. yet even as years pass and lives change, their hearts remain bound by a connection that neither distance nor silence can erase. told through fragile memories and whispered words, their story becomes a testament to a love that endures every storm-one that lives on even when memories begin to disappear. the notebook is not just a romance, but a promise: that true love is eternal.",
      "the movie focuses on an old man reading a story to an old woman in a nursing home. the story he reads follows two young lovers named allie hamilton and noah calhoun, who meet one evening at a carnival. but they are separated by allie's parents who disapprove of noah's unwealthy family, and move allie away. after waiting for noah to write her for several years, allie meets and gets engaged to a handsome young soldier named lon. allie, then, with her love for noah still alive, stops by noah's 200-year-old home that he restored for her, \"to see if he's okay.\" it is evident that they still have feelings for each other, and allie has to choose between her fiancé and her first love."

    "synopsis": [
      "henry roth (adam sandler) is a veterinarian at sea life park on the island of oahu, hawaii. he has a reputation of wooing female tourists, a strategy he employs to avoid becoming involved in a serious relationship. his closest friends are ula (rob schneider), a marijuana-smoking islander; alexa (lusia strus), his androgynous german assistant; willy, his pet african penguin; and jocko, a walrus that lives at the park.\nhenry has been saving up to go on a big boat trip to alaska (bristol bay) and hence does not want any attachments to the island. henry specializes in walruses and his boat trip is to further his research on walruses (in their unspoiled habitat) including what they do under the water, where they spend more than two thirds of their life. one day while sailing, his boat (named the \"sea serpent\") is damaged when the mast breaks and destroys the wheel. henry anchors the boat and takes a rubber dingy to the nearest shoreline.\nhe stops at the hukilau cafe until his boat can be towed back to port, and meets a young woman named lucy whitmore (drew barrymore). henry is instantly smitten with lucy.\nbelieving her to be a local, he avoids introducing himself, but the next day he returns. he and lucy hit it off and she asks him to meet her again the next morning. lucy says that her father marlin and brother doug are fishermen and go out to the sea for months at a time. however, when henry goes back to the cafe the following day, lucy has no memory of their previous meeting. the restaurant owner sue (amy hill) (and her chef and husband nick (pomaika'i brown)) explains to henry that, the previous year, lucy and her father marlin (blake clark) had a serious car accident on his birthday that left her with anterograde amnesia, which inhibits her ability to form new memories. as such, she wakes up every morning thinking it is sunday, october 13, of a year ago. to spare lucy the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, marlin and doug (sean astin), lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out the sunday newspaper, refilling lucy's shampoo bottles, re-watching the same minnesota vikings game, and re-watching the film the sixth sense. despite sue's warning, henry invites lucy to have breakfast with him. eventually she does, but it ends poorly when he unintentionally hurts her feelings. he follows her home to apologize, where marlin and doug instruct him to leave her alone. henry begins concocting ways to run into lucy on the following days.\neventually marlin and doug figure this out and tell henry that lucy sings the beach boys' \"wouldn't it be nice\" only on days when she has met him, the first major change in her routine since the accident. thinking that lucy may be making progress with her condition, they agree to let henry keep seeing her. one day, a police officer writes lucy a ticket for her expired plates. she attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, but realizes it is not october 13 as she thought. distraught and confused, lucy rushes home; marlin and doug admit their ruse.\nhenry comes up with an idea to make a video for lucy that explains her accident and their relationship. although she is upset each time she is told about her accident and memory loss, henry believes that she is more upset about realizing her life has been a lie every day. henry, marlin, and doug show lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off. she spends more time with henry and goes to see some of her old friends. one day, lucy overhears henry talking of his decision not to take a year-long sailing trip to bristol bay to study walruses, something he has been planning for the past 10 years, in favor of spending that year trying to help lucy and make her fall in love with him every day. so, she tells henry that, for his sake, she will erase him completely from her life. henry reluctantly helps lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship. a few weeks later, henry is preparing to leave for his trip. before he departs, marlin tells him that lucy is now living at the brain injury institute where she was first diagnosed and teaching an art class there. he also tells him that she sings. as he is sailing away, henry remembers that marlin once told him that lucy only sings after she meets him. concluding that she remembers him, he rushes to the institute and asks her if lucy knows who he is. she says she does not. lucy then shows him dozens of pictures she has painted of him, saying that although she has no idea who he is, she dreams about him almost every night. sometime later, lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked \"good morning lucy.\" it again informs her of her accident but ends with her and henry's wedding. on the tape, henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready. lucy then sees that she is on henry's boat, which finally made it to alaska. she goes up on deck and meets marlin, henry, and their young daughter, nicole."

      "plot_summary": "Henry Roth, a veterinarian at Sea Life Park in Oahu, Hawaii, lives as a commitment-averse womanizer while saving for a walrus research trip to Bristol Bay. His boat, the Sea Serpent, is damaged and towed; waiting at the Hukilau Café he meets local artist Lucy Whitmore and is immediately smitten. They hit it off and arrange to meet the next morning, but Lucy fails to recognize him. Sue, the café owner, explains that Lucy suffered an anterograde amnesia-inducing car accident on her father Marlin Whitmore's birthday a year earlier and now wakes each morning believing it is October 13 of that year. To spare her the trauma of the accident, Marlin and Lucy's brother Doug re-enact the same day every morning (newspaper, shampoo, a Vikings game, The Sixth Sense). Henry pursues Lucy despite warnings, repeatedly engineering encounters and slowly earning the family's trust after they notice Lucy singing the Beach Boys' “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” only on days she has met Henry. When Lucy briefly realizes time has moved forward after a parking-ticket incident, she is distraught; Henry records an explanatory video for her and he, Marlin, and Doug show it to her each morning so she can resume her life from that point. Lucy spends more days with Henry and visits old friends; Henry reveals he postponed his decade-planned, year-long walrus trip to stay with her, which leads Lucy to tearfully decide to remove him from her life to spare him the sacrifice. They destroy journal entries documenting their relationship and Henry prepares to leave. Months later Marlin tells Henry Lucy is teaching art at the Brain Institute; as Henry sails away he remembers Marlin saying Lucy sings only after meeting him and rushes back to find Lucy has been painting dozens of images of him and dreaming about him nightly, though she does not consciously recognize him. The film culminates with Lucy watching a “Good Morning” tape that ends with footage of her and Henry’s wedding; the final scene reveals Lucy on Henry’s boat in Alaska with Marlin, Henry, and their young daughter Nicole, showing that despite her daily amnesia their relationship and family life endure.",

      "henry roth (adam sandler) is a veterinarian at sea life park on the island of oahu, hawaii. he has a reputation of wooing female tourists, a strategy he employs to avoid becoming involved in a serious relationship. his closest friends are ula (rob schneider), a marijuana-smoking islander; alexa (lusia strus), his androgynous german assistant; willy, his pet african penguin; and jocko, a walrus that lives at the park.\nhenry has been saving up to go on a big boat trip to alaska (bristol bay) and hence does not want any attachments to the island. henry specializes in walruses and his boat trip is to further his research on walruses (in their unspoiled habitat) including what they do under the water, where they spend more than two thirds of their life. one day while sailing, his boat (named the \"sea serpent\") is damaged when the mast breaks and destroys the wheel. henry anchors the boat and takes a rubber dingy to the nearest shoreline.\nhe stops at the hukilau cafe until his boat can be towed back to port, and meets a young woman named lucy whitmore (drew barrymore). henry is instantly smitten with lucy.\nbelieving her to be a local, he avoids introducing himself, but the next day he returns. he and lucy hit it off and she asks him to meet her again the next morning. lucy says that her father marlin and brother doug are fishermen and go out to the sea for months at a time. however, when henry goes back to the cafe the following day, lucy has no memory of their previous meeting. the restaurant owner sue (amy hill) (and her chef and husband nick (pomaika'i brown)) explains to henry that, the previous year, lucy and her father marlin (blake clark) had a serious car accident on his birthday that left her with anterograde amnesia, which inhibits her ability to form new memories. as such, she wakes up every morning thinking it is sunday, october 13, of a year ago. to spare lucy the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, marlin and doug (sean astin), lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out the sunday newspaper, refilling lucy's shampoo bottles, re-watching the same minnesota vikings game, and re-watching the film the sixth sense. despite sue's warning, henry invites lucy to have breakfast with him. eventually she does, but it ends poorly when he unintentionally hurts her feelings. he follows her home to apologize, where marlin and doug instruct him to leave her alone. henry begins concocting ways to run into lucy on the following days.\neventually marlin and doug figure this out and tell henry that lucy sings the beach boys' \"wouldn't it be nice\" only on days when she has met him, the first major change in her routine since the accident. thinking that lucy may be making progress with her condition, they agree to let henry keep seeing her. one day, a police officer writes lucy a ticket for her expired plates. she attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, but realizes it is not october 13 as she thought. distraught and confused, lucy rushes home; marlin and doug admit their ruse.\nhenry comes up with an idea to make a video for lucy that explains her accident and their relationship. although she is upset each time she is told about her accident and memory loss, henry believes that she is more upset about realizing her life has been a lie every day. henry, marlin, and doug show lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off. she spends more time with henry and goes to see some of her old friends. one day, lucy overhears henry talking of his decision not to take a year-long sailing trip to bristol bay to study walruses, something he has been planning for the past 10 years, in favor of spending that year trying to help lucy and make her fall in love with him every day. so, she tells henry that, for his sake, she will erase him completely from her life. henry reluctantly helps lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship. a few weeks later, henry is preparing to leave for his trip. before he departs, marlin tells him that lucy is now living at the brain injury institute where she was first diagnosed and teaching an art class there. he also tells him that she sings. as he is sailing away, henry remembers that marlin once told him that lucy only sings after she meets him. concluding that she remembers him, he rushes to the institute and asks her if lucy knows who he is. she says she does not. lucy then shows him dozens of pictures she has painted of him, saying that although she has no idea who he is, she dreams about him almost every night. sometime later, lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked \"good morning lucy.\" it again informs her of her accident but ends with her and henry's wedding. on the tape, henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready. lucy then sees that she is on henry's boat, which finally made it to alaska. she goes up on deck and meets marlin, henry, and their young daughter, nicole."

      "busy as she is as a boston stager, anna brady likes to control all aspects of her life. one of the few things she has not been able to control is getting married; her boyfriend, cardiologist dr. jeremy sloane, has not yet proposed to her after four years of dating. she hates the story told often to her by her father jack brady that there is an irish tradition that allows women to propose to their loved one on february 29, which is what purportedly got her paternal grandparents together. anna hates surprise herself, but she decides to surprise jeremy by showing up in dublin, where he is attending a conference, and proposing to him on leap day. but her trek from boston to dublin is anything but smooth. she gets stranded in dingle, her unintended entry into ireland, a few days before leap day. despite their antagonistic meeting, struggling pub/innkeeper declan o'callaghan agrees to drive anna to dublin... for a price; the agreed-upon fare would cover much of his debt, which would allow him to keep the pub/inn. largely because of their antagonism, anna, declan and their third, louis (what declan calls her louis vuitton suitcase), get into one misadventure after another, which threatens anna's arrival to dublin by february 29. through their time together, anna and declan might find that there are more important things in life than having that fairytale february 29 proposal and saving the pub/inn through extortion of anna.",

    "synopsis": [
      "successful real estate agent anna brady is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend jeremy sloane still has not proposed to her after four years. she decides to travel from boston to dublin, to propose to him on february 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. anna wishes to invoke an irish tradition that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal. during the flight, a storm diverts the plane to wales, where anna hires a boat to take her to cork. the severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called dingle, where she makes her way to a local tavern. anna tries to enlist the help of declan o'callaghan, the surly irish innkeeper. she requests him to taxi her across the country to dublin. at first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for eur500. the two set out in his old beat-up car. along the way, he makes fun of her fancy louis vuitton luggage, which he calls \"louie\". he also mocks her belief in a leap year \"tradition\" of women proposing to men. their travel is interrupted by a herd of cows blocking the road. anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her expensive shoes while leaning on declan's car which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. continuing on foot, anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. ignoring declan's warning, anna accepts the ride and hands them her luggage. before she can enter the van, they drive off without her. anna and declan eventually make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three van thieves going through anna's luggage. declan fights them, displaying unexpected strength for a man of his size, and retrieves anna's bag. anna and declan are ejected from the pub by the owner for fighting on the premises. anna and declan reach a railway station and decide to wait for the next train. while waiting, they hike up a hill to the ruins of a nearby castle. they ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. in doing so, declan also tells anna of an old irish legend about a young woman engaged to an elderly lord that she did not love. so the woman gave her wedding guests a sleeping potion so she could run away with a young celtic warrior she did love. during the story, they lose track of time and miss the train. that night, anna and declan are forced to stay at a local bed & breakfast in tipperary, where they pretend to be married, taking the name \"o'brady-callaghan\" so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. during dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, anna and declan are \"forced\" to kiss as well. this stirs feelings that neither had expected. that night, they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other. the next day while hitch-hiking down the road, anna and declan are caught in a hail-storm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. they are invited to the reception. but during the reception, anna drinks too much. anna begins to question her own intentions with jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for declan. just as the two are about to kiss, anna vomits and passes out. the following day they arrive in dublin, as they make their way on foot from the bus terminal to the hotel, declan reveals that he was once engaged but his fiancee ran off to dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. anna suggests to declan, now that he is in dublin, that he should ask for his mother's ring back. when they arrive at the hotel where jeremy is staying, jeremy surprises anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. anna turns around to look at declan just to see that he had already walked out of the hotel, and she accepts jeremy's proposal. at their engagement party in boston, anna learns that jeremy decided to propose because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple had wanted to move into at the beginning of the film. dismayed, anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she had discussed with declan earlier. when the alarm sounds, jeremy's instinct is to retrieve all of their electronic materials such as mobile phones, laptops, etc and shows no concern for anna's well-being. at that moment, anna fully realizes that there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including jeremy. meanwhile, back in dublin, declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiancee. sometime later, anna arrives back at caragh's tavern in dingle, where declan is running his seemingly successful business, having pulled together the balance he owed to his property owner with the help of the community. anna reveals to him that she has broken off her engagement to jeremy and tells declan that she has come to believe that all she needs/wants is right in dingle. when she proposes that they get together, ignoring her controlling nature and saying they should not make plans, declan leaves the room. thinking that she had been rejected, anna rushes outside and makes her way to the edge of a nearby cliff overlooking the sea. declan emerges, revealing that he went out simply to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring so that he could give it to her. taking her offer even further, declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. anna happily accepts, and they are later seen in declan's car, leaving their destination open to fate."

She decides to fly to Dublin to propose to him on February 29, invoking an Irish leap-day custom. A storm diverts her flight to Wales; after unsuccessful attempts to reach Dublin she boards a supply vessel but is disembarked at Dingle, County Kerry. In Dingle she finds Caragh's pub/inn and meets its surly owner Declan O'Callaghan. Anna hires Declan to drive her to Dublin for €500 because Declan needs money to avoid foreclosure of his pub. They set out in Declan’s beat-up car with Anna’s Louis Vuitton suitcase (“Louie”) and repeatedly clash over personality and priorities. En route a herd of cows blocks the road; Anna steps in dung and inadvertently causes Declan’s car to roll into a stream. Three travelers offer Anna a ride but steal her luggage; Declan retrieves it after fighting them in a roadside pub. Missed trains force them to hike to castle ruins where they trade “what would you grab in a fire” stories and Declan tells an Irish runaway bride legend. They miss the train and are forced to stay at a conservative bed-and-breakfast in Tipperary, where they pretend to be married and are pressured into public displays of affection, culminating in a kiss and sleeping in the same bed. Hitchhiking during a hailstorm, they shelter in a church with a wedding reception; Anna drinks too much and, after some intimate moments with Declan, vomits and passes out. The next day they reach Dublin. Declan reveals his ex-fiancée ran off to Dublin with his mother's Claddagh ring and his best friend; Anna advises him to reclaim the ring. At the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy surprises Anna by proposing in the lobby and she accepts, while Declan quietly leaves. Back in Boston at the engagement party, Anna learns Jeremy proposed to satisfy the co-op board so they could buy an apartment; during a staged fire alarm she discovers Jeremy prioritizes possessions over her safety and realizes she does not love him. Declan retrieves his mother's Claddagh ring from his ex in Dublin and reconnects with his community to pay off the pub debt. Anna returns to Caragh's in Dingle, tells Declan she broke off the engagement and that she wants what she found in Dingle rather than elaborate plans. She impulsively proposes they be together but Declan initially steps away. On a cliff overlooking the sea he emerges with his mother's Claddagh ring, proposes to Anna, and she accepts. The film ends with Anna and Declan driving away together, leaving their future open.",

      "successful real estate agent anna brady is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend jeremy sloane still has not proposed to her after four years. she decides to travel from boston to dublin, to propose to him on february 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. anna wishes to invoke an irish tradition that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal. during the flight, a storm diverts the plane to wales, where anna hires a boat to take her to cork. the severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called dingle, where she makes her way to a local tavern. anna tries to enlist the help of declan o'callaghan, the surly irish innkeeper. she requests him to taxi her across the country to dublin. at first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for eur500. the two set out in his old beat-up car. along the way, he makes fun of her fancy louis vuitton luggage, which he calls \"louie\". he also mocks her belief in a leap year \"tradition\" of women proposing to men. their travel is interrupted by a herd of cows blocking the road. anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her expensive shoes while leaning on declan's car which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. continuing on foot, anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. ignoring declan's warning, anna accepts the ride and hands them her luggage. before she can enter the van, they drive off without her. anna and declan eventually make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three van thieves going through anna's luggage. declan fights them, displaying unexpected strength for a man of his size, and retrieves anna's bag. anna and declan are ejected from the pub by the owner for fighting on the premises. anna and declan reach a railway station and decide to wait for the next train. while waiting, they hike up a hill to the ruins of a nearby castle. they ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. in doing so, declan also tells anna of an old irish legend about a young woman engaged to an elderly lord that she did not love. so the woman gave her wedding guests a sleeping potion so she could run away with a young celtic warrior she did love. during the story, they lose track of time and miss the train. that night, anna and declan are forced to stay at a local bed & breakfast in tipperary, where they pretend to be married, taking the name \"o'brady-callaghan\" so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. during dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, anna and declan are \"forced\" to kiss as well. this stirs feelings that neither had expected. that night, they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other. the next day while hitch-hiking down the road, anna and declan are caught in a hail-storm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. they are invited to the reception. but during the reception, anna drinks too much. anna begins to question her own intentions with jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for declan. just as the two are about to kiss, anna vomits and passes out. the following day they arrive in dublin, as they make their way on foot from the bus terminal to the hotel, declan reveals that he was once engaged but his fiancee ran off to dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. anna suggests to declan, now that he is in dublin, that he should ask for his mother's ring back. when they arrive at the hotel where jeremy is staying, jeremy surprises anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. anna turns around to look at declan just to see that he had already walked out of the hotel, and she accepts jeremy's proposal. at their engagement party in boston, anna learns that jeremy decided to propose because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple had wanted to move into at the beginning of the film. dismayed, anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she had discussed with declan earlier. when the alarm sounds, jeremy's instinct is to retrieve all of their electronic materials such as mobile phones, laptops, etc and shows no concern for anna's well-being. at that moment, anna fully realizes that there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including jeremy. meanwhile, back in dublin, declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiancee. sometime later, anna arrives back at caragh's tavern in dingle, where declan is running his seemingly successful business, having pulled together the balance he owed to his property owner with the help of the community. anna reveals to him that she has broken off her engagement to jeremy and tells declan that she has come to believe that all she needs/wants is right in dingle. when she proposes that they get together, ignoring her controlling nature and saying they should not make plans, declan leaves the room. thinking that she had been rejected, anna rushes outside and makes her way to the edge of a nearby cliff overlooking the sea. declan emerges, revealing that he went out simply to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring so that he could give it to her. taking her offer even further, declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. anna happily accepts, and they are later seen in declan's car, leaving their destination open to fate."

      "a woman who has an elaborate scheme to propose to her boyfriend on leap day, an irish tradition which occurs every time the date february 29 rolls around, faces a major setback when bad weather threatens to derail her planned trip to dublin. with the help of an innkeeper, however, her cross-country odyssey just might result in her getting engaged.",
      "busy as she is as a boston stager, anna brady likes to control all aspects of her life. one of the few things she has not been able to control is getting married; her boyfriend, cardiologist dr. jeremy sloane, has not yet proposed to her after four years of dating. she hates the story told often to her by her father jack brady that there is an irish tradition that allows women to propose to their loved one on february 29, which is what purportedly got her paternal grandparents together. anna hates surprise herself, but she decides to surprise jeremy by showing up in dublin, where he is attending a conference, and proposing to him on leap day. but her trek from boston to dublin is anything but smooth. she gets stranded in dingle, her unintended entry into ireland, a few days before leap day. despite their antagonistic meeting, struggling pub/innkeeper declan o'callaghan agrees to drive anna to dublin... for a price; the agreed-upon fare would cover much of his debt, which would allow him to keep the pub/inn. largely because of their antagonism, anna, declan and their third, louis (what declan calls her louis vuitton suitcase), get into one misadventure after another, which threatens anna's arrival to dublin by february 29. through their time together, anna and declan might find that there are more important things in life than having that fairytale february 29 proposal and saving the pub/inn through extortion of anna.",
      "when yet another anniversary passes without a marriage proposal from her boyfriend, anna decides to take action. aware of a celtic tradition that allows women to pop the question on feb. 29, she plans to follow her lover to dublin and ask him to marry her. fate has other plans, however, and anna winds up on the other side of the emerald isle with handsome but surly declan an irishman who might just lead anna down the road to true love.",
      "anna brady of boston is a planner who stages apartments for realtors; she's been dating cardiologist jeremy for four years and they are buying a high-standard apartment in davenport together. she expects him to propose to her on a dinner date, but he doesn't; soon after he travels to dublin for a conference. she decides to join him there on february 29 and propose to him, in accordance with an irish folklore tradition from the fifth century of leap-year proposals by women. however, bad weather forces her plane to land in wales and she can't find a connection because the dublin airport is closed. she decides to travel on a supply vessel but a storm forces her to disembark in dingle. anna walks to the only restaurant and inn and hires the unfriendly owner, declan, to drive her to dublin. declan agrees to drive her as he needs the money to pay off his debts, but their journey is fraught with incidents."

Christian, a 27-year-old billionaire and control-driven entrepreneur, takes a strong interest in Ana. After the interview he visits the hardware store where Ana works, arranges a photo shoot to accompany the article, and sends Ana first-edition novels including Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Christian offers Ana an internship (which she declines) and pursues her with gifts and intense attention. They begin seeing each other; after Ana passes out drunk at a bar, she wakes in Christian's hotel room. Christian presents Ana with a non-disclosure agreement and later a detailed contract defining a dominant/submissive sexual relationship confined to a specific “playroom” in his Seattle apartment. Ana reveals she is a virgin; Christian first has conventional sex with her so her first sexual experience is not in bondage, then introduces her to light bondage using silk ties. Christian discloses elements of his troubled past (he was adopted at four; a patient seduced him when he was 15 and he was submissive for years) and shows emotional distance. He introduces Ana to his adoptive parents (Mr. Grey and Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey) and his sister Mia. Ana researches BDSM and negotiates the contract, removing clauses she won’t accept; Christian praises her attention to detail and offers to reserve one night a week for a date. They grow closer and Ana moves to Seattle with Kate. Christian continues to push sexual experimentation; Ana asks him to demonstrate how he would “punish” her. Christian strikes Ana six times with a belt while she counts, leaving her upset and shaken. Realizing Christian’s need for control and pain-based discipline is incompatible with her desire for a romantic, reciprocal relationship, Ana concludes he is wrong for her and leaves him.",

she wants romance rather than a purely generative union. christian wants ana to sign the contract, but she wants him to accept her as she is, and not try to change her.\nshe is shocked when christian unexpectedly arrives in georgia while she is visiting her mother. christian leaves soon after to tend to an emergency in seattle. after returning home, ana continues seeing christian, who is still interested in further venereal experimentation. ana initially consents and participates willingly. christian, however, keeps ana emotionally distant, upsetting her. christian is not willing to have a \"normal\" relationship with ana. while still considering the contract, ana asks christian to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule breaking. ana cannot understand why christian would have a need to hurt her in any way.\nchristian whips ana's backside six times with a belt, making her count each time he strikes her. she is upset and finds it far from her romantic expectations.\nana concludes that christian is wrong for her and that his practices border on being deviant and excessive and leaves."

    "synopsis": [
      "in 1934, famous detective hercule poirot (kenneth branagh) solves a theft at the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem. the obsessive compulsive belgian-who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth a curse-wants to rest in istanbul but must return to london for another case. his friend bouc (tom bateman), director of the orient express, offers him a room on the train. poirot refuses businessman samuel ratchett's (johnny depp) offer to hire him as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, as ratchett has received threatening letters from an unknown party. that night poirot hears strange noises coming from ratchett's compartment, and sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. an avalanche derails the train and strands the passengers.\nthe next morning poirot learns ratchett was murdered during the night after being stabbed a dozen times. poirot and bouc investigate passengers as repairs begin. evidence indicates that ratchett was murdered by one person, with caroline hubbard (michelle pfeiffer) claiming that a man was in her compartment during the night and that since her cabin was next to ratchett, the murderer would have entered ratchett's cabin through hers.\npoirot discovers a partially destroyed note connecting ratchett to the kidnapping of daisy armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. after the ransom was paid, daisy was found murdered. ratchett is identified as john cassetti, daisy's kidnapper and murderer. her death caused her mother sonia (miranda raison) to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, colonel armstrong, then committed suicide. the family's nursemaid susanne was arrested and hanged herself while in police custody, but exonerated after her death.\nthe train compartments were locked at night, so the only suspects were the people in that particular compartment. also that compartment had a guard who said he saw nobody enter ratchett's cabin during the time of his death. ratchett's coffee is found to be drugged, but his valet henry does not know how the coffee was drugged before or after he delivered it to ratchett.\nthen poirot finds hector trying to burn the ledgers of ratchett's accounts. poirot stops him and accuses him of stealing from ratchett and hence killing him for the fear of being found out. but dr artbutnot confirms that hector was drinking with him all night. more evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief and the button of a conductor's uniform found in hubbard's compartment. the uniform is later found, as is the kimono, discovered in poirot's own suitcase. hubbard is stabbed in the back; she survives but cannot identify the culprit. poirot discovers several of the passengers have direct connections to the armstrong family. while interviewing governess mary debenham (daisy ridley), john arbuthnot (leslie odom jr.) shoots poirot in the shoulder claiming that he is the murderer, but is stopped by bouc. poirot realizes that arbuthnot-a medical doctor and former army sniper-never meant to kill him.\npoirot then interview count and countess andrenyi. he finds that countess's passport has been tampered and deduces that her first name is not elena, but helena. he then deduces that helena is in fact the sister of sonia armstrong, who is living in permanent fear from the events of the past. poirot meets the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how ratchett died. the first is simple: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train, murdered ratchett, and fled. the second is more complex: every suspect is connected to the armstrongs, susanne, or her trial in some way-including those who had pretended otherwise-and had motive to kill ratchett/cassetti. hubbard is revealed to be linda arden, former stage actress and sonia armstrong's mother.\npoirot reveals that the 13 other passengers on the train, and the train conductor, were all connected to the armstrong family in some way:\nhector willard macqueen (josh gad), ratchett/cassetti's secretary was devoted to sonia armstrong. macqueen's father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case. he knew from his father the details of cassetti's escape from justice and intended to kill ratchett. hector's father was pressured to go after the maid on flimsy evidence. the maid later killed herself and then the evidence turned towards casetti. hector's father was pilloried for this.\nedward henry masterman (derek jacobi), ratchett/cassetti's valet, was colonel armstrong's batman during the war, and later his valet, who also acted as butler to the armstrong household.\ncolonel arbuthnot was colonel armstrong's comrade and best friend.\nmrs. hubbard is, in actuality, linda arden (maiden name goldenberg), the most famous tragic actress of the new york stage, and was sonia armstrong's mother and daisy's grandmother.\ncountess andrenyi (née helena goldenberg) (lucy boynton) was sonia armstrong's sister.\ncount andryeni (sergei polunin) was the husband of helena andrenyi.\nprincess natalia dragomiroff (judi dench) was sonia armstrong's godmother, and a friend of her mother.\nmiss mary debenham was sonia armstrong's secretary and daisy armstrong's governess.\nfräulein hildegarde schmidt (olivia colman), princess dragomiroff's maid, was the armstrong family's cook.\nantonio foscarelli, a car salesman based in chicago, was the armstrong family's chauffeur.\nmiss greta ohlsson, a swedish missionary, was daisy armstrong's nurse.\npierre michel (marwan kenzari), the train conductor, was the father of susanne, the armstrong's nursemaid who committed suicide.\ncyrus hardman (willem dafoe), a private detective ostensibly retained as a bodyguard by ratchett/cassetti, was a policeman in love with susanne.\npilar estravados (penélope cruz) was daisy's nurse and has now turned to religion and service of god.\nmanuel garcia-rulfo as biniamino marquez hubbard admits that she gathered everyone and planned the murder. all of the suspects took turns stabbing ratchett. arbuthnot stabbed hubbard without endangering her life to convince poirot of a lone killer. poirot challenges the passengers to shoot him with his gun since he is the only one who can expose their plot; bouc can lie but poirot-obsessed with truth and balance-cannot. hubbard grabs the gun and tries to kill herself. the gun is unloaded; poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.\nas the train is put back on track poirot concludes that justice is impossible in the case, as ratchett deserved death; for the first time he will have to live with a lie and imbalance. poirot presents the lone killer theory to the yugoslavian police, allowing the suspects to leave. as he disembarks the train a messenger asks him to investigate a death on the nile. poirot takes the case."

      "plot_summary": "In 1934 Hercule Poirot, a famed Belgian detective, finishes a theft case at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and intends to travel to Istanbul, but returns to London. His friend Bouc, a director at the Simplon-Orient-Express company, arranges him a berth on the Orient Express. American businessman Samuel Ratchett (revealed later as John Cassetti) asks Poirot for protection against threatening letters; Poirot refuses. During the night Poirot hears noises from Ratchett's compartment and sees someone in a red kimono in the corridor. An avalanche derails and stalls the train; the next morning Ratchett is found stabbed multiple times in his locked compartment. Poirot and Bouc begin an on-train investigation while repairs are arranged. Evidence includes a drugged cup of coffee, a bloodstained handkerchief, a conductor's uniform button in Mrs. Hubbard's compartment, and a burned scrap of a note linking Ratchett to the 1929 Daisy Armstrong kidnapping and murder. Ratchett is identified as John Cassetti, the man responsible for Daisy Armstrong's kidnapping and death; the Armstrong family was destroyed—Sonia Armstrong died after giving birth to a stillborn, Colonel Armstrong committed suicide, the maid Susanne was arrested and later killed herself. Poirot questions passengers: Caroline Hubbard (Mrs. Hubbard) claims a man entered her cabin; Hector MacQueen (Ratchett's secretary) tries to destroy Ratchett's account books and is accused of theft; Edward Henry Masterman (Ratchett's valet) has an ambiguous past with Colonel Armstrong; Mary Debenham (governess), Colonel Arbuthnot (army officer), Count and Countess Andrenyi, Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her maid Hildegarde Schmidt, Greta Ohlsson (nurse), Antonio Foscarelli (chauffeur), Pilar Estravados (nurse), conductor Pierre Michel, and private detective Cyrus Hardman are all examined. Mrs. Hubbard is later stabbed in the back but survives. Poirot discovers the Andrenyi countess's passport has been altered and deduces her real name is Helena Goldenberg, sister to Sonia Armstrong. Tensions escalate when Arbuthnot fires a gun and shoots Poirot in the shoulder, then claims he intended to kill Poirot as the murderer; Bouc stops him and Arbuthnot's shot is shown to be nonfatal and not meant to kill. Poirot assembles everyone and offers two solutions: (A) a single unknown intruder disguised as a conductor boarded and murdered Ratchett, or (B) a conspiracy in which multiple passengers all connected to the Armstrong tragedy collaborated to kill Cassetti. Poirot reveals that each principal passenger has a direct link to the Armstrong family or Susanne: MacQueen's father was the district attorney in the case; Masterman served Colonel Armstrong; Arbuthnot was Colonel Armstrong's friend; Mrs. Hubbard is actually Linda Arden, Sonia Armstrong's mother; Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, Sonia's sister; Princess Dragomiroff was a friend and godmother of Sonia; Debenham was Daisy's governess; Schmidt was the Armstrong household cook; Foscarelli was the family chauffeur; Greta Ohlsson was Daisy's nurse; Pierre Michel was Susanne's father; Cyrus Hardman loved Susanne; Pilar was Daisy's nurse. Bouc and the conductor are also implicated in the broader plan. Poirot shows that the thirteen passengers and the conductor conspired: they drugged Ratchett, entered his compartment in turns, and each stabbed him so the murder would be shared among them. Arbuthnot stabbed Mrs. Hubbard in the back to prove a lone assailant narrative false; he and others staged actions to mislead Poirot. Poirot stages a test with an unloaded gun to provoke reactions and to confirm their collective guilt; Mrs. Hubbard attempts suicide with the gun but it is empty. With the train repaired, Poirot presents two official reports to Bouc and the Yugoslavian police: one detailing the single unknown assailant theory and one exposing the conspiracy. Believing that legal justice would fail and that Ratchett/Cassetti deserved death for Daisy Armstrong, Bouc and the company accept the conspiracy cover story; Poirot, forced to live with a moral compromise he calls imbalance, allows the suspects to go free under the lone-killer explanation. As he disembarks, Bouc receives a messenger requesting Poirot investigate a murder on the Nile; Poirot accepts and departs.",

      "in 1934, famous detective hercule poirot (kenneth branagh) solves a theft at the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem. the obsessive compulsive belgian-who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth a curse-wants to rest in istanbul but must return to london for another case. his friend bouc (tom bateman), director of the orient express, offers him a room on the train. poirot refuses businessman samuel ratchett's (johnny depp) offer to hire him as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, as ratchett has received threatening letters from an unknown party. that night poirot hears strange noises coming from ratchett's compartment, and sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. an avalanche derails the train and strands the passengers.\nthe next morning poirot learns ratchett was murdered during the night after being stabbed a dozen times. poirot and bouc investigate passengers as repairs begin. evidence indicates that ratchett was murdered by one person, with caroline hubbard (michelle pfeiffer) claiming that a man was in her compartment during the night and that since her cabin was next to ratchett, the murderer would have entered ratchett's cabin through hers.\npoirot discovers a partially destroyed note connecting ratchett to the kidnapping of daisy armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. after the ransom was paid, daisy was found murdered. ratchett is identified as john cassetti, daisy's kidnapper and murderer. her death caused her mother sonia (miranda raison) to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, colonel armstrong, then committed suicide. the family's nursemaid susanne was arrested and hanged herself while in police custody, but exonerated after her death.\nthe train compartments were locked at night, so the only suspects were the people in that particular compartment. also that compartment had a guard who said he saw nobody enter ratchett's cabin during the time of his death. ratchett's coffee is found to be drugged, but his valet henry does not know how the coffee was drugged before or after he delivered it to ratchett.\nthen poirot finds hector trying to burn the ledgers of ratchett's accounts. poirot stops him and accuses him of stealing from ratchett and hence killing him for the fear of being found out. but dr artbutnot confirms that hector was drinking with him all night. more evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief and the button of a conductor's uniform found in hubbard's compartment. the uniform is later found, as is the kimono, discovered in poirot's own suitcase. hubbard is stabbed in the back; she survives but cannot identify the culprit. poirot discovers several of the passengers have direct connections to the armstrong family. while interviewing governess mary debenham (daisy ridley), john arbuthnot (leslie odom jr.) shoots poirot in the shoulder claiming that he is the murderer, but is stopped by bouc. poirot realizes that arbuthnot-a medical doctor and former army sniper-never meant to kill him.\npoirot then interview count and countess andrenyi. he finds that countess's passport has been tampered and deduces that her first name is not elena, but helena. he then deduces that helena is in fact the sister of sonia armstrong, who is living in permanent fear from the events of the past. poirot meets the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how ratchett died. the first is simple: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train, murdered ratchett, and fled. the second is more complex: every suspect is connected to the armstrongs, susanne, or her trial in some way-including those who had pretended otherwise-and had motive to kill ratchett/cassetti. hubbard is revealed to be linda arden, former stage actress and sonia armstrong's mother.\npoirot reveals that the 13 other passengers on the train, and the train conductor, were all connected to the armstrong family in some way:\nhector willard macqueen (josh gad), ratchett/cassetti's secretary was devoted to sonia armstrong. macqueen's father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case. he knew from his father the details of cassetti's escape from justice and intended to kill ratchett. hector's father was pressured to go after the maid on flimsy evidence. the maid later killed herself and then the evidence turned towards casetti. hector's father was pilloried for this.\nedward henry masterman (derek jacobi), ratchett/cassetti's valet, was colonel armstrong's batman during the war, and later his valet, who also acted as butler to the armstrong household.\ncolonel arbuthnot was colonel armstrong's comrade and best friend.\nmrs. hubbard is, in actuality, linda arden (maiden name goldenberg), the most famous tragic actress of the new york stage, and was sonia armstrong's mother and daisy's grandmother.\ncountess andrenyi (née helena goldenberg) (lucy boynton) was sonia armstrong's sister.\ncount andryeni (sergei polunin) was the husband of helena andrenyi.\nprincess natalia dragomiroff (judi dench) was sonia armstrong's godmother, and a friend of her mother.\nmiss mary debenham was sonia armstrong's secretary and daisy armstrong's governess.\nfräulein hildegarde schmidt (olivia colman), princess dragomiroff's maid, was the armstrong family's cook.\nantonio foscarelli, a car salesman based in chicago, was the armstrong family's chauffeur.\nmiss greta ohlsson, a swedish missionary, was daisy armstrong's nurse.\npierre michel (marwan kenzari), the train conductor, was the father of susanne, the armstrong's nursemaid who committed suicide.\ncyrus hardman (willem dafoe), a private detective ostensibly retained as a bodyguard by ratchett/cassetti, was a policeman in love with susanne.\npilar estravados (penélope cruz) was daisy's nurse and has now turned to religion and service of god.\nmanuel garcia-rulfo as biniamino marquez hubbard admits that she gathered everyone and planned the murder. all of the suspects took turns stabbing ratchett. arbuthnot stabbed hubbard without endangering her life to convince poirot of a lone killer. poirot challenges the passengers to shoot him with his gun since he is the only one who can expose their plot; bouc can lie but poirot-obsessed with truth and balance-cannot. hubbard grabs the gun and tries to kill herself. the gun is unloaded; poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.\nas the train is put back on track poirot concludes that justice is impossible in the case, as ratchett deserved death; for the first time he will have to live with a lie and imbalance. poirot presents the lone killer theory to the yugoslavian police, allowing the suspects to leave. as he disembarks the train a messenger asks him to investigate a death on the nile. poirot takes the case."

      "evelyn wang is going through the motions of life in trying to achieve some sort of fulfillment, which she may or may not admit to herself has, so far, been unsuccessful at almost any level. she and her husband, waymond wang, own and operate a laundromat, and while she loved him when they were first married - marrying him against the advice of her judgmental father's - she now feels that he is a weak man whose messes she has to fix. on the flip side, she has no idea that he has had papers drawn for divorce, or that he only plans on going through with it as a last resort if things between them don't improve. she feels she has never really had the love or respect of her father - whom she ran away from as a young adult - and now he has come from asia to the us to live with her and waymond. evelyn and waymond's only offspring, young adult joy wang, has turned into a version of her by pulling away, not feeling any love or getting any respect, and as such, being aimless in life. what may be the pinnacle of the mother/daughter problems is that joy has not only brought her girlfriend becky into their lives - how to explain becky to her father and others like him; the biggest issue in the same sex vein - but becky is also white. conversely, evelyn's life could have been so much more if she made different choices or followed through with any of the many other things she started. on top of preparing for a chinese new year's eve party under the pressure of trying to meet the exacting standards of her father, she and waymond are also in the middle of an irs audit by their auditor, hard-nosed deirdre beaubeirdre. as evelyn and waymond enter into what is supposed to be their final \"show me the proper paperwork or else\" meeting with deirdre, evelyn physically and metaphysically enters into alternate universes, where she not only has to make the right choices to save the collective universe, but arguably more importantly, come to a true understanding of herself.",

    "synopsis": [
      "evelyn quan wang (michelle yeoh) is a middle-aged chinese american immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, waymond (ke huy quan); two decades earlier, they eloped to the united states and had a daughter, joy (stephanie hsu). in the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the internal revenue service (irs); waymond is trying to serve evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as gong gong (james hong), cantonese for 'grandfather') is visiting for her chinese new year party; and joy is dealing with depression and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes evelyn's reluctance to accept joy's lesbian relationship with her non-chinese girlfriend becky (tallie medel). at a tense meeting with irs inspector deirdre beaubeirdre (jamie lee curtis), waymond's body is taken over by alpha-waymond, a version of waymond from the \"alphaverse.\" alpha-waymond explains to evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. the alphaverse, led by the late alpha-evelyn, developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. the multiverse is threatened by jobu tupaki (alpha-joy), whose mind was splintered after alpha-evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. she has created a black hole-like \"everything bagel\" topped with everything, which appears as a toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse. alpha-evelyn made it the task of the alpha-verse to find the one who can stand up to jobu tupaki.\nwhile evelyn goes into a different universe, her body in the original universe stays, but her mind is not there. this happens during the audit meeting with deirdre and the meeting is not going well. she says evelyn is charging her hobbies as business expenses, and can be charged for fraud, or will have to pay a fine. in her confusion evelyn strikes deirdre during the audit who calls security. alpha-waymond appears again inside waymond's body and helps evelyn escape.\nthey are still trapped inside the irs building as dierdre from a tetra-verse appears inside dierdre's body and blocks their path. evelyn is given verse-jumping technology by alpha-waymond to fight jobu's minions, who converge on the irs building. she discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star; she also learns of waymond's plans with the divorce papers. evelyn uses her powers to defeat alpha-dierdre and the other minions. jobu tupaki directs all the minions to the irs building in the original evelyn's universe when she senses that evelyn has started gaining powers.\nalpha-waymond believes that evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat jobu. gong gong is taken over by alpha-gong gong, who instructs evelyn to kill joy to stop jobu from using her to enter evelyn's universe.\nevelyn refuses and decides to face jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. evelyn believes that the only way to defeat jobu tupaki is to become like her.\nalpha-gong gong, convinced that evelyn's mind has been compromised like jobu's, sends soldiers after evelyn. while they fight, jobu locates and kills alpha-waymond in the alphaverse. as jobu confronts evelyn in her universe (she shows evelyn the real bagel black hole and tells her that the real truth is that nothing matters), evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses. evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the evelyns that do not agree with her. she brings evelyn to the everything bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and evelyn to truly die. upon looking into the bagel, evelyn is initially persuaded, and acts cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her (she even signs the divorce papers with waymond and proceeds to destroy her own laundromat). as evelyn is about to enter the bagel with jobu, she pauses to listen to waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. in her home universe, evelyn reconciles with waymond, accepts joy and becky's relationship and tells gong gong of it, and talks with deirdre after waymond convinces deirdre to let them redo their taxes\nevelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow waymond's absurdist and humanist advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy and brings happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes alpha-gong gong and jobu's fighters.\njobu decides to enter the bagel alone while, simultaneously in evelyn's universe, joy begs evelyn to let her go. evelyn tells joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with joy. evelyn and the others save jobu from the bagel, and evelyn and joy embrace. some time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the irs building to refile their taxes. as deirdre talks, evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe."

      "plot_summary": "Evelyn Quan Wang, a middle-aged Chinese American laundromat owner in the U.S., is juggling a failing laundromat, an IRS audit, a strained marriage to Waymond Wang, a distant adult daughter Joy, and the critical presence of her demanding father (Gong Gong) visiting for Chinese New Year. At an audit meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Alpha‑Waymond — a version of Waymond from the “alphaverse” — suddenly inhabits Waymond’s body and reveals the multiverse: countless parallel universes spawned by choices, and technology that lets someone “verse-jump” into other selves to borrow skills and memories. Alpha‑Waymond says Evelyn is uniquely positioned to stop Jobu Tupaki (an alternate Joy warped by excessive verse‑jumping), who experiences all universes at once and has created a destructive singularity called the “everything bagel.”\n\nDuring the audit, Evelyn involuntarily verse-jumps: her consciousness moves into other Evelyns in different universes while her original body remains behind. Alpha‑Waymond helps her escape the IRS building when security is called after Evelyn strikes Deirdre in confusion. Deirdre becomes possessed by alternate versions working for Jobu; more minions from other universes converge on the IRS building to capture Evelyn. Alpha‑Waymond instructs Evelyn and trains her to access skills (kung fu, saxophone, espionage) by triggering improbable actions; Evelyn briefly inhabits many alternate lives, seeing versions where she was a chef, a movie star, and a kung fu master.\n\nEvelyn learns that Alpha‑Evelyn from the alphaverse pushed Alpha‑Joy (Jobu Tupaki) to verse-jump repeatedly; Jobu’s mind fragmented and she now seeks to collapse the multiverse with the everything bagel. Alpha‑Waymond believes Evelyn — whom many universes consider a “failure” — can defeat Jobu because her unlived possibilities give her untapped adaptability. Gong Gong is commandeered by an alpha‑Gong Gong who orders Evelyn to kill Joy to stop Jobu using her as a conduit; Evelyn refuses. Soldiers from alternate universes attack. Jobu kills Alpha‑Waymond in the alphaverse and continues manipulating universes; she confronts Evelyn, arguing that nothing matters and inviting Evelyn to enter the bagel to die.\n\nEvelyn’s mind begins to fracture under Jobu’s nihilism and she lashes out in other universes, temporarily embracing cruelty and signing divorce papers with her home‑universe Waymond and sabotaging her laundromat. While poised to enter the bagel beside Jobu, Evelyn hears Waymond’s plea — in their home universe he persistently calls for kindness and connection — and rejects Jobu’s totalizing nihilism. Evelyn chooses to fight with empathy rather than mimic Jobu’s destruction: she uses verse-jumping to repair harm in other universes, to disarm alpha‑Gong Gong and Jobu’s fighters, and to reconnect with her family. In her home universe she reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy’s relationship with Becky, and tells Gong Gong she will support Joy. Joy, who had contemplated being used as Jobu’s entry, begs Evelyn to let her go; Evelyn affirms that even if the multiverse makes no ultimate sense, she chooses to be with Joy.\n\nEvelyn and her allies rescue Jobu from entering the everything bagel; Jobu, confronted with Evelyn’s persistent kindness and connection, stops trying to destroy reality and allows herself to be saved. The family returns to the IRS to refile taxes; Deirdre is still present, and Evelyn briefly flits to alternate selves but grounds herself in her chosen life. The film ends with Evelyn committed to repair and connection: her relationships with Waymond, Joy, and Gong Gong improved, and she has embraced a life of small, meaningful choices over cosmic nihilism.",

      "evelyn quan wang (michelle yeoh) is a middle-aged chinese american immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, waymond (ke huy quan); two decades earlier, they eloped to the united states and had a daughter, joy (stephanie hsu). in the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the internal revenue service (irs); waymond is trying to serve evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as gong gong (james hong), cantonese for 'grandfather') is visiting for her chinese new year party; and joy is dealing with depression and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes evelyn's reluctance to accept joy's lesbian relationship with her non-chinese girlfriend becky (tallie medel). at a tense meeting with irs inspector deirdre beaubeirdre (jamie lee curtis), waymond's body is taken over by alpha-waymond, a version of waymond from the \"alphaverse.\" alpha-waymond explains to evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. the alphaverse, led by the late alpha-evelyn, developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. the multiverse is threatened by jobu tupaki (alpha-joy), whose mind was splintered after alpha-evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. she has created a black hole-like \"everything bagel\" topped with everything, which appears as a toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse. alpha-evelyn made it the task of the alpha-verse to find the one who can stand up to jobu tupaki.\nwhile evelyn goes into a different universe, her body in the original universe stays, but her mind is not there. this happens during the audit meeting with deirdre and the meeting is not going well. she says evelyn is charging her hobbies as business expenses, and can be charged for fraud, or will have to pay a fine. in her confusion evelyn strikes deirdre during the audit who calls security. alpha-waymond appears again inside waymond's body and helps evelyn escape.\nthey are still trapped inside the irs building as dierdre from a tetra-verse appears inside dierdre's body and blocks their path. evelyn is given verse-jumping technology by alpha-waymond to fight jobu's minions, who converge on the irs building. she discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star; she also learns of waymond's plans with the divorce papers. evelyn uses her powers to defeat alpha-dierdre and the other minions. jobu tupaki directs all the minions to the irs building in the original evelyn's universe when she senses that evelyn has started gaining powers.\nalpha-waymond believes that evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat jobu. gong gong is taken over by alpha-gong gong, who instructs evelyn to kill joy to stop jobu from using her to enter evelyn's universe.\nevelyn refuses and decides to face jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. evelyn believes that the only way to defeat jobu tupaki is to become like her.\nalpha-gong gong, convinced that evelyn's mind has been compromised like jobu's, sends soldiers after evelyn. while they fight, jobu locates and kills alpha-waymond in the alphaverse. as jobu confronts evelyn in her universe (she shows evelyn the real bagel black hole and tells her that the real truth is that nothing matters), evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses. evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the evelyns that do not agree with her. she brings evelyn to the everything bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and evelyn to truly die. upon looking into the bagel, evelyn is initially persuaded, and acts cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her (she even signs the divorce papers with waymond and proceeds to destroy her own laundromat). as evelyn is about to enter the bagel with jobu, she pauses to listen to waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. in her home universe, evelyn reconciles with waymond, accepts joy and becky's relationship and tells gong gong of it, and talks with deirdre after waymond convinces deirdre to let them redo their taxes\nevelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow waymond's absurdist and humanist advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy and brings happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes alpha-gong gong and jobu's fighters.\njobu decides to enter the bagel alone while, simultaneously in evelyn's universe, joy begs evelyn to let her go. evelyn tells joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with joy. evelyn and the others save jobu from the bagel, and evelyn and joy embrace. some time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the irs building to refile their taxes. as deirdre talks, evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe."

      "with her laundromat teetering on the brink of failure and her marriage to wimpy husband waymond on the rocks, overworked evelyn wang struggles to cope with everything, including a tattered relationship with her judgmental father and daughter. and as if facing a gloomy midlife crisis wasn't enough, evelyn must brace herself up for an unpleasant meeting with an impersonal bureaucrat: deirdre, the shabbily dressed irs auditor. however, as the stern agent loses patience, an inexplicable multiverse rift becomes an eye-opening exploration of parallel realities. will evelyn jump down the rabbit hole? but how many stars are in the universe? can weary evelyn fathom the irrepressible force of possibilities, tap into newfound powers, and prevent an evil entity from destroying the thin, countless layers of the unseen world?",
      "evelyn wang is going through the motions of life in trying to achieve some sort of fulfillment, which she may or may not admit to herself has, so far, been unsuccessful at almost any level. she and her husband, waymond wang, own and operate a laundromat, and while she loved him when they were first married - marrying him against the advice of her judgmental father's - she now feels that he is a weak man whose messes she has to fix. on the flip side, she has no idea that he has had papers drawn for divorce, or that he only plans on going through with it as a last resort if things between them don't improve. she feels she has never really had the love or respect of her father - whom she ran away from as a young adult - and now he has come from asia to the us to live with her and waymond. evelyn and waymond's only offspring, young adult joy wang, has turned into a version of her by pulling away, not feeling any love or getting any respect, and as such, being aimless in life. what may be the pinnacle of the mother/daughter problems is that joy has not only brought her girlfriend becky into their lives - how to explain becky to her father and others like him; the biggest issue in the same sex vein - but becky is also white. conversely, evelyn's life could have been so much more if she made different choices or followed through with any of the many other things she started. on top of preparing for a chinese new year's eve party under the pressure of trying to meet the exacting standards of her father, she and waymond are also in the middle of an irs audit by their auditor, hard-nosed deirdre beaubeirdre. as evelyn and waymond enter into what is supposed to be their final \"show me the proper paperwork or else\" meeting with deirdre, evelyn physically and metaphysically enters into alternate universes, where she not only has to make the right choices to save the collective universe, but arguably more importantly, come to a true understanding of herself.",
      "evelyn wang and her husband, waymond, run a laundromat. times are tough, and they're in trouble with the internal revenue service. there's also some fuss with their daughter, and evelyn's father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. and now, waymond wants a divorce. could things have turned out differently for evelyn--maybe in a parallel universe?",
      "a middle-aged chinese laundromat owner must get in touch with her other selves who are scattered across the multiverse. this woman is the key to saving reality itself, but she can't do it alone; her family's fate is intertwined with the fate of the multiverse too."

      "in toronto, scott pilgrim (michael cera), a 22 year old bass guitarist for the band \"sex bob-omb\", begins dating a 17-year-old high-school student knives chau (ellen wong), much to the disapproval of his friends 22 years old stephen stills (mark webber), 23 years old kim pine (alison pill), 20 years old \"young\" neil nordegraf (johnny simmons), his roommate 25 years old wallace wells (kieran culkin), and his younger 18 years old sister stacey pilgrim (anna kendrick). knives and scott haven't even kissed each other yet and were far from having sex. they held hands together once and knives got embarrassed. it's been a year since scott was dumped by natalie. wallace is gay and is dating other scott (ben lewis). everyone is worried that scott is now dating a high-school student. julie powers (aubrey plaza) is a 23-year-old worker at a record store.\nscott imagines his life to be like a video-game, with every character having their title cards, displaying essential information along with their powers. scott meets an american girl, ramona flowers (mary elizabeth winstead), an american amazon delivery girl, who has been appearing in his dreams, and becomes obsessed with her. julie tells scott that ramona is out of his league. she is the coolest girl in town, has a boyfriend in new york, but had a big fight with him recently. julie says that ramona keeps mentioning a name gideon.\nscott loses interest in knives but does not break up with her before pursuing ramona. both wallace and stacey tell scott to break up with knives before going after ramona, but he ignores them. scott orders stuff from amazon so ramona has to come and deliver it. scott asks ramona out on a date, and she accepts else otherwise scott would not sign for the package. they end up in ramona's apartment due to a snowstorm and scott sleeps in her bed, though ramona changes her mind about having sex with scott on their first date. scott invites ramona to the battle of the bands.\nscott also receives an email from matthew patel challenging him to a duel. while playing in a battle of the bands sponsored by one \"g-man graves\" for a record deal, scott is attacked by matthew patel (satya bhabha), who introduces himself as the first of ramona's \"evil exes\". ramona & patel dated for a week and a half in 7th grade, post which ramona dumped him. scott defeats patel and learns from ramona that, in order for them to date, he must defeat all seven of her evil exes.\nramona and knives were both at the battle of the bands and knives kisses scott in front of ramona. while going home with scott on the bus, ramona admits that she is dating scott and agrees to make out with him. the next day, knives invites scott to her birthday dinner with her parents. knives says that she is in love with scott. scott finally breaks up with knives, who blames ramona and swears to win him back, by becoming more like ramona. scott battles ramona's second evil ex, popular actor and skateboarder lucas lee (chris evans), who he defeats by tricking him into performing a dangerous skateboard grind that causes him to ignite. scott later encounters the third evil ex, todd ingram (brandon routh), who is dating scott's ex-girlfriend, natalie \"envy\" adams (brie larson). envy is in a band herself and invites scott's band to open the show for them. todd is part of envy's band. todd initially overpowers scott using his psychic vegan abilities but is stripped of his powers by the vegan police after scott tricks him into drinking coffee with half and half cream, allowing scott to defeat him. scott begins to grow upset with ramona over her dating history by the defeat of the fourth ex, roxanne \"roxy\" richter (mae whitman). ramona had a brief lesbian fling with roxy before she dumped her & made her an \"evil ex\". when roxy attacks scott, ramona steps in to protect scott and defeat roxy.\nscott grows frustrated during the process, and after an outburst regarding ramona's dating history, she breaks up with him. during the second round of the battle of the bands, sex bob-omb faces off against the fifth and sixth evil exes, twin katayanagi brothers kyle (shota saito) and ken (keita saito), earning scott an extra life upon their defeat. during the battle, scott sees ramona together with her seventh evil ex, gideon graves (jason schwartzman), who turns out to be sex bob-omb's sponsor, g-man. the members of sex bob-omb accept gideon's record deal, except for scott, who leaves the band. upon returning home, scott receives a phone call invitation from gideon to his newly opened chaos theater where sex bob-omb is playing, claiming there to be \"no hard feelings\". scott arrives and challenges gideon to a fight, professing his love for ramona and gaining a sword called the \"power of love\", which gideon easily destroys. knives then crashes the scene to fight ramona over scott. scott goes to break up the girls' fight, only to accidentally reveal that he cheated on them with each other before he is killed by gideon. ramona visits scott in limbo and apologizes for getting him involved in her affairs, revealing that gideon had planted a mind control device in the back of her head. scott realizes he still has an extra life and uses it to return to life at the moment in time when gideon first called him. scott reenters the chaos theater where he makes peace with his friends and challenges gideon again, stating he is fighting for himself and gaining the much stronger \"power of self-respect\" sword with which he strikes down gideon. he then apologizes to ramona and knives for cheating on them, but gideon interferes and knocks down ramona, leading scott and knives to team up and defeat him. free from gideon's control, ramona prepares to leave, but knives accepts that her relationship with scott is over and encourages him to follow ramona. he does, and the two start their relationship anew."

The third evil ex, Todd Ingram, is the bassist for Envy Adams' new band and has psychic \"vegan\" powers; Todd initially overpowers Scott, but after Scott tricks Todd into drinking coffee with cream and the Vegan Police revoke Todd's powers, Scott defeats him. Roxanne \"Roxy\" Richter, Ramona's fourth evil ex and a brief lesbian fling, attacks Scott; Ramona intervenes and helps Scott subdue Roxy. Ramona and Scott's relationship strains; after Scott lashes out about her past she breaks up with him.\n\nAt a second Battle of the Bands, Scott fights twin techno-producers the Katayanagi Brothers (evil exes five and six) and defeats them, earning an extra life. Sex Bob-omb accepts a record deal offered by Gideon Graves (the seventh evil ex) and his company; Scott refuses and leaves the band. Gideon, revealed as the band's sponsor \"G-Man Graves,\" invites Sex Bob-omb to the Chaos Theatre. At the Chaos Theatre Gideon bests Scott in combat, then uses a device in Ramona's backpack to control her; Knives crashes the show and fights Ramona over Scott. Scott tries to stop the fight, accidentally admitting he dated both girls simultaneously, and Gideon kills Scott. In limbo Ramona apologizes and reveals Gideon planted a subcutaneous mind-control component in her; Scott uses an unused extra life to revive at the moment Gideon first called him.\n\nBack at the Chaos Theatre Scott makes amends with his friends, then confronts Gideon again. He declares he fights for himself and acquires the \"power of self-respect\" sword, which can defeat Gideon; Gideon shatters Scott's earlier \"power of love\" sword. During the final fight Ramona is freed from Gideon's control; Scott, Ramona and Knives briefly team up and together they defeat Gideon. Gideon dies; Ramona prepares to leave but Knives accepts that Scott and Ramona belong together and encourages Scott to follow Ramona.

      "in toronto, scott pilgrim (michael cera), a 22 year old bass guitarist for the band \"sex bob-omb\", begins dating a 17-year-old high-school student knives chau (ellen wong), much to the disapproval of his friends 22 years old stephen stills (mark webber), 23 years old kim pine (alison pill), 20 years old \"young\" neil nordegraf (johnny simmons), his roommate 25 years old wallace wells (kieran culkin), and his younger 18 years old sister stacey pilgrim (anna kendrick). knives and scott haven't even kissed each other yet and were far from having sex. they held hands together once and knives got embarrassed. it's been a year since scott was dumped by natalie. wallace is gay and is dating other scott (ben lewis). everyone is worried that scott is now dating a high-school student. julie powers (aubrey plaza) is a 23-year-old worker at a record store.\nscott imagines his life to be like a video-game, with every character having their title cards, displaying essential information along with their powers. scott meets an american girl, ramona flowers (mary elizabeth winstead), an american amazon delivery girl, who has been appearing in his dreams, and becomes obsessed with her. julie tells scott that ramona is out of his league. she is the coolest girl in town, has a boyfriend in new york, but had a big fight with him recently. julie says that ramona keeps mentioning a name gideon.\nscott loses interest in knives but does not break up with her before pursuing ramona. both wallace and stacey tell scott to break up with knives before going after ramona, but he ignores them. scott orders stuff from amazon so ramona has to come and deliver it. scott asks ramona out on a date, and she accepts else otherwise scott would not sign for the package. they end up in ramona's apartment due to a snowstorm and scott sleeps in her bed, though ramona changes her mind about having sex with scott on their first date. scott invites ramona to the battle of the bands.\nscott also receives an email from matthew patel challenging him to a duel. while playing in a battle of the bands sponsored by one \"g-man graves\" for a record deal, scott is attacked by matthew patel (satya bhabha), who introduces himself as the first of ramona's \"evil exes\". ramona & patel dated for a week and a half in 7th grade, post which ramona dumped him. scott defeats patel and learns from ramona that, in order for them to date, he must defeat all seven of her evil exes.\nramona and knives were both at the battle of the bands and knives kisses scott in front of ramona. while going home with scott on the bus, ramona admits that she is dating scott and agrees to make out with him. the next day, knives invites scott to her birthday dinner with her parents. knives says that she is in love with scott. scott finally breaks up with knives, who blames ramona and swears to win him back, by becoming more like ramona. scott battles ramona's second evil ex, popular actor and skateboarder lucas lee (chris evans), who he defeats by tricking him into performing a dangerous skateboard grind that causes him to ignite. scott later encounters the third evil ex, todd ingram (brandon routh), who is dating scott's ex-girlfriend, natalie \"envy\" adams (brie larson). envy is in a band herself and invites scott's band to open the show for them. todd is part of envy's band. todd initially overpowers scott using his psychic vegan abilities but is stripped of his powers by the vegan police after scott tricks him into drinking coffee with half and half cream, allowing scott to defeat him. scott begins to grow upset with ramona over her dating history by the defeat of the fourth ex, roxanne \"roxy\" richter (mae whitman). ramona had a brief lesbian fling with roxy before she dumped her & made her an \"evil ex\". when roxy attacks scott, ramona steps in to protect scott and defeat roxy.\nscott grows frustrated during the process, and after an outburst regarding ramona's dating history, she breaks up with him. during the second round of the battle of the bands, sex bob-omb faces off against the fifth and sixth evil exes, twin katayanagi brothers kyle (shota saito) and ken (keita saito), earning scott an extra life upon their defeat. during the battle, scott sees ramona together with her seventh evil ex, gideon graves (jason schwartzman), who turns out to be sex bob-omb's sponsor, g-man. the members of sex bob-omb accept gideon's record deal, except for scott, who leaves the band. upon returning home, scott receives a phone call invitation from gideon to his newly opened chaos theater where sex bob-omb is playing, claiming there to be \"no hard feelings\". scott arrives and challenges gideon to a fight, professing his love for ramona and gaining a sword called the \"power of love\", which gideon easily destroys. knives then crashes the scene to fight ramona over scott. scott goes to break up the girls' fight, only to accidentally reveal that he cheated on them with each other before he is killed by gideon. ramona visits scott in limbo and apologizes for getting him involved in her affairs, revealing that gideon had planted a mind control device in the back of her head. scott realizes he still has an extra life and uses it to return to life at the moment in time when gideon first called him. scott reenters the chaos theater where he makes peace with his friends and challenges gideon again, stating he is fighting for himself and gaining the much stronger \"power of self-respect\" sword with which he strikes down gideon. he then apologizes to ramona and knives for cheating on them, but gideon interferes and knocks down ramona, leading scott and knives to team up and defeat him. free from gideon's control, ramona prepares to leave, but knives accepts that her relationship with scott is over and encourages him to follow ramona. he does, and the two start their relationship anew."

terrorist act against the united states. the man who is later shown to be pahpshmir is also present. frank drebin (leslie nielsen) has been posing undercover as a waiter; he beats up all the attendees, revealing that gorbachev is an impostor and various other shocking facts about them in the process, and warns them that they will never attack america as long as he is on the job. in los angeles, officer nordberg (o.j. simpson) unsuccessfully attempts to bust a heroin drug operation at the docks organized by vincent ludwig (ricardo montalban) and is shot numerous times by ludwig's henchmen. after being briefed on the case by his colleague and friend, captain ed hocken (george kennedy), frank visits nordberg in the hospital. nordberg can provide only a few cryptic clues, including a picture of ludwig's ship on which the deal had been organized. frank later meets with wacky police scientist named ted olsen (ed williams), who has invented a cuff-link that shoots out a tiny dart which renders the victim unconscious, promptly testing it on hocken. while discussing nordberg's case, it is revealed that the police force suspects nordberg to be corrupt and involved in drug dealings. hocken gives drebin 24 hours to clear nordberg's name. pahpshmir meets with ludwig, who announces that he will assassinate queen elizabeth ii (jeannette charles) for $20 million. with his beeper used as an acoustic trigger, ludwig demonstrates that he has a way of turning anyone into an unknowing assassin via the post-hypnotic suggestion. later, drebin visits ludwig in his office and inadvertently lets slip the information that nordberg is still alive, which results in an assassination attempt by a hypnotized physician. frank chases the assassin in a commandeered teen driving school car until the luckless fugitive crashes the car into a gasoline truck, a u.s. army missile transporter, and-riding astride the missile-a fireworks factory. as drebin works on the case, he meets and falls in love with ludwig's assistant, jane spencer (priscilla presley). it is eventually revealed that she knows nothing about ludwig's plot, and after jane learns of her employer's villainy, she helps frank with his investigation. however, things go awry as frank breaks into ludwig's office to get crucial information. in the process of finding that information, frank ends up setting a fire that completely destroys ludwig's office. later, to make things worse, after frank accidentally sees ludwig appear to make an outright assassination attempt on the queen at a reception, frank ends up causing more trouble and is removed from police squad. during the queen's visit to a california angels baseball game, jane tells frank that one of the team's players will conduct the assassination. while hiding from his fellow policemen, who are now under orders to arrest him, frank first attempts to disguise himself as the opera singer enrico pallazzo, brutally mangling the u.s. national anthem along the way, and manages to secure the position of the home plate umpire and begins calling the game while simultaneously frisking all players for weapons. finally, realizing that he is running out of time, frank goes to great lengths to delay the game, ultimately resorting to interfering with the play to the ire of the managers of the mariners and the angels. ludwig activates his 'sleeper', the right-fielder for the angels, reggie jackson. jane alerts frank, who chases after jackson. jackson catches and tackles him, inadvertently triggering a bench-clearing brawl between the angels and their opponent, the seattle mariners, while ludwig takes jane to the top of the stadium at gunpoint. during the brawl, jackson emerges from the pile and points his gun at the queen. however, frank fires one of ted's cuff-link darts to incapacitate jackson, but accidentally hits a fat woman in the upper mezzanine instead. still, frank manages to save the queen's life, because the dazed fat woman falls on top of jackson, knocking him out. frank later moves through the crowd to the top of the stadium, where ludwig holds jane at gunpoint. frank shot ludwig with the other cuff-link dart, causing ludwig to stagger and fall several stories over the stadium's railing. the usc marching band tromps over ludwig's steamroller-flattened body, triggering his beeper and thus activating jane's own post-hypnotic suggestion, which compels her to kill frank with ludwig's gun. frank uses his reverse psychology to try and break jane's hypnotized state by openly professing his feelings for her, and gives her an engagement ring, after which jane is freed from ludwig's hypnosis and finally accepts frank's marriage proposal. frank's speech is broadcast on the stadium screen, causing the teams and the audience to burst into tears, fall into each other's arms and make up. afterwards, frank and jane meet mayor barkley (nancy marchand), who reinstates frank back to police squad, and nordberg congratulates him. nordberg, while still on wheelchair-bound, seems much better until frank pats nordberg on the back, accidentally sending him toppling down the aisle and up over the railing of the stadium's upper deck."

      "plot_summary": "In Beirut, Lebanon, Lieutenant Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) is undercover as a waiter at a meeting of international terrorists and disrupts the gathering. Back in Los Angeles, Officer Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) attempts to bust a heroin deal at the docks tied to wealthy developer Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban) and is shot and hospitalized. Captain Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) briefs Drebin and gives him 24 hours to clear suspicions that Nordberg was corrupt. Drebin visits Nordberg in the hospital and later consults eccentric police scientist Ted Olson, who equips Drebin with a cuff-link that fires a tranquilizing dart. Ludvig meets with a foreign agent called Pahpshmir and is contracted to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II during her Los Angeles visit by using a post-hypnotic acoustic trigger to turn someone into an unwitting assassin. Drebin investigates Ludwig, inadvertently alerts Ludwig that Nordberg survived, and survives an assassination attempt by a hypnotized physician, pursuing him through Los Angeles until the assassin crashes spectacularly. Drebin falls for Ludwig’s assistant Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley); she is initially unaware of Ludwig’s plot but, when she learns of it, begins helping Drebin. Drebin breaks into Ludwig’s office searching for evidence and accidentally burns it down. After a reception where Drebin misinterprets events and is removed from Police Squad, Jane informs him that an Angels baseball player has been hypnotized as the assassin. During the California Angels–Seattle Mariners game at the stadium attended by the Queen, Drebin disguises himself as opera singer Enrico Pallazzo to get access, then becomes the home-plate umpire to frisk players. Ludwig activates his sleeper: right fielder Reggie Jackson, who, during a bench-clearing brawl Drebin provokes, emerges armed and points a gun at the Queen. Drebin fires Olson’s cuff-link dart intended for Jackson but instead hits a spectator; that spectator falls on Jackson, knocking him out and preventing the assassination. Ludwig takes Jane to the top of the stadium and holds her at gunpoint; Drebin climbs up, wounds Ludwig with the second dart, and Ludwig falls over the railing. Ludwig’s beeper triggers Jane’s post-hypnotic suggestion, forcing her to aim at Drebin; Frank publicly professes love and proposes with an engagement ring to break her conditioning, which frees her. The Queen is saved; Drebin is reinstated to Police Squad, Jane accepts his proposal, Nordberg congratulates him but accidentally falls off his wheelchair and over the railing, providing a final comic close.",
