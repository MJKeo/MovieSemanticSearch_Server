        "text": "I remember watching this movie, and while I loved the first 2 acts, both full of endless laughter, I couldn&#39;t help but think that Ferris Bueller was something of a narcissist. He does many seemingly selfish things; lying to his parents, humiliating his principal, and putting his &#39;best friend&#39; in danger, all so he can have 7 carefree hours off of school. It is not until the 3rd act that he becomes a 3-dimensional character, and we begin to understand him and realize he is not the sociopath we might have assumed he is. While it seems he does all the things he does for his own pleasure, it becomes clear in the last 20 minutes he was really doing it for his friend. At the beginning of the movie, Cameron is timid, constantly worried, and unsure of himself. We learn\nhis parents argue, and his dad neglects him, and would rather work on his Ferrari instead of spending time with his son. Throughout the movie, Ferris tries to boost his friend&#39;s self-esteem, and by the end, he has succeeded. His friend is a completely different person, and most of the major characters are, notably his sister. However, Ferris doesn&#39;t seem to change at all. He helps his friends become better people, but in doing so, he isn&#39;t changing at all."

While this film single handedly made him Ferris Bueller forever, at least this is a film that can be seen all throughout the years without dating too badly. Sure, the music and props will signify a time of discontent and bad hairdos, but the idealistic look of a man simply wanting to ditch school has never been made more daringly and charmingly. <br/><br/>Everything about this film was gold, from the postmodern &quot;conversations&quot; with the audience to the little back stories which seem to shape the overall canvas of the film. While Alan Ruck was way too old to play in this movie, at least he proved to be a great opposite to the cool and nonchalant Ferris. Gross-out comedies may now be the norm, at least we can look back to this film and enjoy a good, genuine laugh."

        "summary": "Recaptures \"Youngness\"",
        "text": "I rewatched FBDO (sorry, had to) for the first time in many years. I was not even 10 when it came out, and it is not until now that I have appreciated it a level beyond the basic comedy. It has comedy for sure, of all kinds. Slapstick, absurdity, farce, comedy-of-errors, comedy-of-manners, puns, shock, swearing, satire, parody, and on and on.<br/><br/>But is so much more than an outstanding comedy. It has real philosophy that is not sophomoric (they&#39;re seniors and juniors...haha). This comes in Ferris&#39;s asides, but also in what the characters say when they are not joking.<br/><br/>It has some complete non-sequiturs and montages that really make you ponder the characters and that capture what it is like to be young in a way that you almost never see, e.g., them looking down from the Sears Tower, the scene at the art musuem, etc.<br/><br/>Why? Well, real teenagers can almost never make enduring art, so they have a hard time capturing what its like to be young in any way beyond the surface. You have to know what it fleeting about youth to capture it and you only know that once you&#39;re not young any more. A 17 year old writing this movie couldn&#39;t capture youth because youth are just to callow and to inexperienced with life. But adults, even when they try to write about youth, often infuse that feeling with too much importance that isn&#39;t present when you&#39;re young. It gets too nostalgic, or treacly, or whatever.<br/><br/>But with FBDO, John Hughes just takes your mind back to what it was like to be about to graduate high school.<br/><br/>Yes, these are all privileged white kids. Yes, the whole move is extra white and extra privileged. Minorities are relegated to some really insulting stereotypical parts. So in that regard, it has not aged well at all.<br/><br/>BUT! This movie still captures late adolescence perfectly. That feeling of knowing your childhood is about to disappear and missing it already, but being excited about your unknown future that seems to stretch out forever ahead of you. And scared at the same time.<br/><br/>It just leaves you feeling warm and reminiscent and happy to be an adult, but really glad you were a kid.<br/><br/>I also like that Ferris, for all his likability, is a flawed character. He is a narcissist. But he&#39;s 17 (maybe 18). He hurts Cameron&#39;s feelings over and over in a way that is close to bullying or gaslighting. But protagonists shouldn&#39;t be perfect. And Ferris&#39;s flaws illustrate those of the other characters in a way that is very illuminating.<br/><br/>All these characters have a depth that is so lacking (except maybe the dad). Certainly Sloane and Cameron and Ferris are totally three dimensional. But even his sister, and mom are shown as real people too.<br/><br/>But then you have totally INSANE absurd non-sequiturs thrown in. The principal is an absolute cartoon. So is his secretary. The BONKERS way everyone in town is pulling for Ferris. I mean, they paint a WATERTOWER in like an hour?!?! The parking lot joyride. Abe Froman!? The whole parade sequence?! It is just crazy how all that happens and the movie still feels &quot;real.&quot;<br/><br/>An absolute joy to watch. I haven&#39;t seen a comedy this deep in years. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, another John Hughes movie is probably similar in that regard. They do not make them like this much any more. Even 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, for all their dealing with &quot;big issues&quot; seem to be inhabited by cardboard cutouts (the stoner, the hectoring girlfriend/wife) compared to this film.<br/><br/>Watch it every couple years. You won&#39;t regret it."

And with &quot;Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off&quot;, he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who&#39;s ever been a teenager can relate to.<br/><br/>Who hasn&#39;t known someone like Ferris Bueller (Broderick)? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose?<br/><br/>All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer.<br/><br/>Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hookey and Ferris&#39; own sister (Grey, pre-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the &quot;trouser-snake&quot;. <br/><br/>There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck&#39;s worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dystalic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship.<br/><br/>Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris&#39; passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school.<br/><br/>All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade. <br/><br/>You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic &#39;80s teendom at its best?

        "text": "My friends knowing that I&#39;m a huge film buff asked me to come up with a list of my favorite movies of all time, when it came down to number one, there was one film that stood out in my head that I knew I could watch over and over again and never get sick of: Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off. One of the best comedies of all time, Ferris Bueller is a movie that just stands the test of time. How anyone could not love this film is beyond any of my understanding, Ferris Bueller is my hero among many others. John Hughes is usually remembered more for The Breakfast Club, which is an incredible movie as well, but I think this was his masterpiece. He said in an interview that this was his childhood, getting his wife and best friend and skipping out on school to go down town and just have a good time. If you are a Chicago citizen, you&#39;ve pulled a Ferris Beuller&#39;s day off too, it&#39;s like a law here, lol, if you haven&#39;t, I pity you. The reason that this movie works is because of it&#39;s outrageous story that everyone wants to live, Matthew Broderick, there was no other choice, he is who everyone wants to be: Ferris Bueller.<br/><br/>Ferris Bueller is a teenager who fakes out his parents on being sick, even though it is his worst performance of being ill, somehow it works and his parents let him stay home. He takes the gorgeous day outside, takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times. I&#39;m not kidding fellow Chicagoians, this is the best Chicago movie! Ferris has two problems though, his principal who is sick of being made a fool of and decides to bust Ferris on his fake illness. And his sister Jeanie, who cares more about Ferris&#39;s life than her own and just wants to prove that he&#39;s faking it.<br/><br/>Even though, you have to admit that it&#39;s a bit unrealistic that it is broadcast throughout Chicago that Ferris is &quot;dying&quot; and no one notices that he&#39;s singing in the Chicago parade, on a field trip to the Art Institute with an elementary class, getting &quot;snootie&quot; with a waiter at Chicago&#39;s finest restaurant, and catching the Cub&#39;s home run ball at Wrigley Field, you just have fun and cannot stop laughing. Plus you have got to love Edward Rooney, the obsessed principal who is actually sicker than Ferris in one way of putting it. He goes through the whole city to find him just so Ferris doesn&#39;t make a fool of him, but he fails on all levels because Ferris is just that awesome. The scene between him and Grace when Cameron prank calls to get Ferris&#39; girlfriend out of school is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I don&#39;t know what else to honestly say other than this movie is the best comedy to watch if you are looking for a great laugh. So sit, back and enjoy because &quot;life moves pretty fast. If you don&#39;t stop and take a look around once in a while, you might miss it&quot;; my philosophy. I will love Ferris Bueller till the day I die.<br/><br/>10/10"

Like the 1961 Ferrari GT 250 SWB California portrayed in this film (more than one used in production, and all were well-made knock-offs as no one was going to risk knocking around an ultra-rare $25M collectable), there is simply no substitute (George Lucas&#39; American Graffiti&#39; still reins as the all-time #1 COA film, but that came 10 years earlier, and is in a class by itself, although this film is also deserving of being considered an &quot;important and significant film&quot;).<br/><br/>This was John Hughes&#39; 4th directed movie, during his most prodigious period from 1984 to 1990, that also included &#39;The Breakfast Club&#39; and &#39;Home Alone&#39;.<br/><br/>Hughes tried to portray teens realistically and gave them relevance in his films - he was empathetic to the challenges of adolescence, and consciously avoided Hollywood&#39;s often shallow characterizations of the teen high school years.<br/><br/>The Library of Congress selected the film in 2014 to be preserved in the National Film Registry, honoring FBDO for its cultural significance."

        "text": "First of all let me say that this movie is genuinely, ingeniously funny, the watch-it-twelve-times-and-it-never-gets-old kind of movie. I myself have seen it seven and a half times and will probably view it again before the end of summer. The movie stars then 23-year-old Matthew Broderick as 17-year-old Ferris Bueller, a high school student who would like nothing better than to be done with school. So he gives in to a strong temptation to cut class and go to downtown Chicago with friends Cameron and girlfriend Sloane (who he gets out of school extremely cleverly, and quite hilariously i might add!). It doesn&#39;t take long for principal Edward Rooney to catch on to Ferris&#39;s skipping, so he tries as hard as he can to catch him, but is going on about it quite unsuccessfully. All through the movie we learn of Cameron&#39;s struggles with his parents and life itself, and through all the hilarity of the movie Cameron finds a part of himself that he hadn&#39;t been able to find before. The movie consists of several several fun scenes, such as the German American Appreciation Day Parade, in which Ferris climbs onto the Great Float and the parade-goers dance to &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; by Wayne Newton and &quot;TWIST AND SHOUT&quot; of course, by the Beatles. Other very important characters are Jeanie Bueller, his revenge-seeking sister who can&#39;t seem to understand why Ferris gets away with everything, and Grace, the absent-minded and honest-to-a-fault secretary. There are so many left out parts and characters but to see them all you&#39;ll have to watch the movie (you won&#39;t regret it!). &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&#39;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot; -ferris bueller I give this movie 2 thumbs up, if only i had more hands i could give it a higher rating...."

        "text": "Like Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off seems to hold a pretty firm and entrenched place in whatever 1980s teen cannon that people hold in such high regard. Back to the Future was, perhaps famously, rejected by many-a studios on the basis of &#39;not being raunchy enough&#39;; something other films of its ilk were at the time. I can imagine something similar happening to Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off, but like Back to the Future, it is the decidedly &#39;un-raunchy&#39; films of the era that we now revisit the most often and just seem to hold in higher regard.<br/><br/>I think what keeps this film resonating with past and current audiences alike is its clear distinction in paying close attention to young people, and their ever-ongoing battle for independence, for recognition and for individuality. The lead is Ferris Bueller (Broderick); a young and very confident, almost borderline sociopathic in his behaviour, male in then-contemporary America. Ferris is the sort of guy who can con his way into an expensive restaurant; hack his way into the school computer mainframe and shows total disregard to his friend&#39;s and certain respective situations when trying to haggle the use of a rare and classic car for the day. The film takes special care in introducing him as an individual whom lives in a large, detached house in a rich neighbourhood that comes complete with a white picket fence. He is literate in all the latest gadgets and pieces of technology, be it home computers used to hack or stereo systems to further the notion he is unwell.<br/><br/>In direct opposition to Ferris is the principal of Ferris&#39; school, named Ed Rooney (Jones). Rooney isn&#39;t just out to capture Bueller as he plays truant, he is out to destroy Bueller&#39;s life; this, Rooney outlines as his goal very early on in the piece. This seems to be the essence of what keeps audiences old and new consistently discovering the film; that study of &#39;old vs. young&#39; as these cocky, smart and quite attractive bunch of confident oddball kids dare stand up to those of a high authority; those that are grey, suit-clad authoritarian figures such as Rooney.<br/><br/>But I think Bueller is smarter-still than what he lets on. He talks very early on about how important it is to go to college and learn a trade and live the American Dream, but he does so in a very nonchalant manner, almost as if he is repeating what it is he&#39;s told to say, or think, or feel. What follows is a chain of events and total disregard to most things that suggest he isn&#39;t of this ideation at all. But the journey does have an ideation; an ideation Bueller himself cooks up to do with being able to notice life and enjoy life as best you can, otherwise it might seem like it&#39;s passing you by.<br/><br/>But the film isn&#39;t preoccupied with just these studies. Its attention to young vs. old or independence vs. routine is similarly played about with through one of Bueller&#39;s two friends named Cameron Frye (Ruck), who is given a slight subplot to do with being able to stand up to his father. Ferris and Cameron&#39;s third friend is Sloane Peterson (Sara), Ferris&#39; girlfriend. The three complete an unusual triangle of pals; they are one another&#39;s&#39; friend as well as foil, forever getting into adventures and situations but hitting the odd wall when it comes to the finer things during the day out. Cameron is forever concerned with the car; Cameron and Sloane are forever worried they might get caught (particularly when Ferris partakes in a large musical number in the street) and Ferris seems forever pre-occupied that the three of them will not get the best out of their day off; a day off Ferris sees as a gift, as something they worked hard towards earning with their scheming, and thus; must embrace it as fully as possible.<br/><br/>The film is a love story, a comedy that relies on slapstick, situation and screwball alike; the film is an odd beast of basic convention, surrealist humour and truancy glorification. But does it ever focus too much on one thing? Does it particularly care what you might think of it? I don&#39;t think it does, it just throws mostly everything at the screen, stirs it all up and allows it all to play out. It feels like two, or possibly three, different films at once – but that&#39;s fine because there is enough different sorts of content all brewing at once, and focused on at a balanced rate, that we go with it. One might say the film&#39;s attitude echoes that of its lead; it&#39;s doing things its own way, in its own style and doesn&#39;t particularly mind how you react. It&#39;s the kind of film that can go from a slow motion shot of two guys driving a sort-of stolen car that was sort-of stolen in the first place to the Star Wars theme; to a series of scenes that rely on a school teacher falling over a few times as a source of humour. The best thing about it all, is that it&#39;s all actually rather effective."

Broderick is perfect, but it is Jeffrey Jones who gives a searing comic potryal of Ed Rooney, a Mr. Weatherbee-like principal wanting to catch Ferris in only act of treachery; holding him back for one more year of high school. John Hughes is at his best here. The dialogue for this film has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don&#39;t blame them. It&#39;s a classic!"

      "plot_summary": "Ferris Bueller, a popular high school senior in suburban Chicago, decides to skip school by faking an illness so his parents, Tom and Katie Bueller, will keep him home. He rigs his bedroom with a mannequin, a trophy, and a record player to sell the ruse. Ferris cajoles his anxious best friend Cameron Frye and girlfriend Sloane Peterson to join him in taking Cameron's father's restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California into downtown Chicago for the day. Ferris also engineers a phone call impersonation—Cameron posing as Sloane's father—to get Sloane excused from school for a fabricated family death.\n\nAt school, Ferris's absence quickly becomes legendary; donations and concern flood the school. Only Ferris's resentful sister Jeanie Bueller and the school's dean of students, Edward Rooney, suspect the truth. Rooney, convinced Ferris is playing hooky again, leaves campus to hunt him down, visiting local hangouts and finally driving to the Bueller house, where he tries to force entry. Rooney gets stuck in the mud, loses a shoe and his wallet, and is chased by the family dog; Jeanie returns home, mistakes Rooney for a burglar, kicks him, and calls the police. The police take Jeanie to the station for a prank call investigation where she briefly talks with a drug dealer, then is picked up by their mother.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane leave the Ferrari with two garage attendants who promptly take it for a joyride, adding many miles to the odometer. The trio spend the day visiting Chicago landmarks: Wrigley Field to watch the Cubs, the Sears Tower, the Art Institute of Chicago (where Ferris delivers a quiet moment to Cameron in front of a painting), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and they join the Von Steuben Day parade. Ferris lip-syncs Wayne Newton's \"Danke Schoen\" and later leads a crowd in a raucous performance of the Beatles' \"Twist and Shout.\" Ferris also poses as Abe Frohman, the sausage king of Chicago, to get an upscale table at a Rush Street restaurant, narrowly avoiding running into his own father.\n\nCameron becomes increasingly distraught over the Ferrari's odometer, fearing his abusive father's reaction. On the drive home they recover the car but discover hundreds of miles have been added. Ferris attempts to reverse the odometer by running the car in place in Cameron's father's garage, jacking the rear wheels up and spinning them backward. Cameron, in a burst of anger and a confrontation with his fear of his father, smashes the car's nose against the garage, accepts responsibility for his life, but then the car slips off the jack, rolls backwards through the garage glass and down a hillside ravine, totaling the Ferrari.\n\nFerris walks Sloane home and then races across suburban backyards toward his house, pursued by time. Rooney has returned to the Bueller home looking for evidence and waits at the front door. Jeanie, who has been trying to expose Ferris all day, unexpectedly arrives home first after speeding to beat him; she pretends to scold Ferris for trying to walk home sick, presents Rooney with his lost wallet to prove she 'saved' the day, and allows Rooney to drive the feigning Ferris to his house. Rooney again is harried by the dog and flees. Ferris makes it into bed just as his parents check on him; after they leave he breaks the fourth wall to tell the audience, \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" The film ends with Rooney humiliated and forced to catch a ride on a school bus, and Ferris addressing the audience again in a closing gag.",

      "high school senior ferris bueller (matthew broderick) decides to skip school on a spring day by faking an illness for his parents (lyman ward and cindy pickett), then encourages his girlfriend, sloane (mia sara), and his pessimistic best friend cameron (alan ruck) to spend the day in chicago as one of their last flings before they graduate and head off to different colleges. he sets up an elaborate ruse in his bedroom with a mannequin, a trophy and his stereo in case anyone decides to check on him. ferris persuades cameron to let them use his father's restored 1961 ferrari 250 gt \"california\" to pick up sloane (as part of their cover) to travel into the city. he also has cameron impersonate sloane's stuffy-toned father to have sloane excused for the day due to a faked death in the family. the rest of the school and many residents learn of ferris' exaggerated illness and offer donations to help \"save ferris\". however, only two people are not convinced by ferris' deception: his sister, jeanie (jennifer grey), outraged at ferris' ability to defy authority easily, and the school's dean of students, edward rooney (jeffrey jones), believing ferris to be truant. ferris and his friends arrive downtown and leave the ferrari with two garage attendants (richard edson and larry jenkins), who drive off in it a short while later to take a joyride. ferris, sloane, and cameron enjoy the sights, including taking in a cubs game at wrigley field, visiting the sears tower, the art institute of chicago, the chicago mercantile exchange, and taking part in the von steuben day parade, with ferris lip-syncing to wayne newton's \"danke schoen\" and the beatles' version of \"twist and shout\", dedicating the former to cameron himself. ferris also uses his ploys to pretend he is abe froeman, the sausage king of chicago, to dine at an upscale restaurant on rush street (while narrowly avoiding his own father who is dining out with some business associates). meanwhile, mr. rooney has gone off-campus to try to find ferris, first at a local hangout, then to ferris' home, where mr. rooney attempts to gain entry, but ends up getting stuck in the mud and losing his shoe and wallet while being chased by the dog. jeanie comes home to look for ferris, instead discovering mr. rooney, whom she mistakes for a burglar, kicking him several times in the face and retreating. she calls the police, forcing mr. rooney to flee the scene. when the police show up, they haul jeanie in for prank calling, and at the police station, she talks to a drug dealer (charlie sheen), who tells her that she needs to stop obsessing about her brother and focus on herself. jeanie's mother shows up to collect her, upset at having to do so, and finds jeanie making out with the boy. at the end of the day, ferris and his friends retrieve the ferrari, but discover on the way home that hundreds of miles have been added to the odometer, sending cameron into a panic fearing his abusive father's reaction. after calming cameron down, ferris comes up with a plan to run the car in reverse, in place, with its rear wheels jacked up, at cameron's father's hillside garage, hoping to reverse the odometer. when they realize this is not working, cameron unleashes his pent-up anger against his father, yelling about how his father loves the car more than his own son and damaging the front of the car, but comes to realize he is long due to stand up to his father, and vows to accept the consequences. cameron calms down and rests himself against the car, but his previous actions have unbalanced it from the jack it was on, the car hits the ground, races in reverse, and crashes through a glass wall, landing in a ravine. despite ferris' offer to take the blame, cameron still plans to admit his actions to his father and take the consequences. ferris walks sloane home, then quickly races through the backyards of his neighborhood. while running across a street, he's nearly hit by a car: it is his sister and mother driving home. his mother doesn't spot him but jeanie does and she floors the gas pedal, trying to beat him home. ferris continues his race home. when he gets there, he finds mr. rooney waiting for him. however, jeanie, apparently having come to appreciate her brother's craftiness, has beaten him home despite her mother's demands and getting a ticket for speeding. she pretends to scold ferris for trying to walk home from the hospital while he is so ill, and thanks mr. rooney for driving him home, making sure to show mr. rooney the wallet he left behind when he broke in earlier. rooney is once again chased by the dog. ferris races to his room and makes it into bed just as his parents check on him. after they leave, he breaks the fourth wall and imparts some wisdom to his audience: \"life moves pretty fast. if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" as the credits roll, mr. rooney in his disheveled state is forced to catch a ride back to school on a school bus. in the tag at the very end of the credits, ferris emerges from the bathroom, pleading to the audience directly, \"you're still here? it's over! go home! go!\" before he turns around and reenters the bathroom."

Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn&#39;t be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando &quot;Godfather&quot; bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn&#39;t run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn&#39;t stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis&#39;s Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like &#39;being all you can be&#39; and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I&#39;ll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - &quot;I want to try even though I could fail...&quot;. It&#39;s a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don&#39;t measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message."

She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>It may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn&#39;t take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn&#39;t expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that&#39;s what it delivered. The &quot;true&quot; conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.<br/><br/>One small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn&#39;t only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.<br/><br/>Using cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.<br/><br/>Brilliant movie."

First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. Although a city full of anthropomorphic animals that dress and act like humans has been extremely popular since animation existed, I believe this Disney movie takes it to a new level. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the animal characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It&#39;s amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages."

What is different about &quot;Zootropolis&quot; - called &quot;Zootopia&quot; in the USA - is that this is not one breed of talking animals existing in a human world, but every breed of animal inhabiting a world in which there are no humans. The colourful representation of this world, the engaging variety of characters, and the clever script with a message of tolerance and inclusion make for a wonderful movie from Walt Disney Productions.<br/><br/>The basic story is a kind of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; pairing of two unlikely partners in crime- fighting: a female rabbit called Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a shady fox called Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). In pursuit of a missing person (sorry, animal), they encounter all sorts of adventures and a cast of characters ranging from sloths who will not be hurried to a Mr Big who turns out to be a tiny version of &quot;The Godfather&quot; concluding with a singing gazelle (Shakira).

We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.<br/><br/>1. Animation\nThe animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character&#39;s feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won&#39;t be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well.\n2. Score\nFor me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song.\n3. Plot twist\nThis is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of &quot;disaster&quot; in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem.\n4. Moral Value\nSame as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that&#39;s a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don&#39;t be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can.\nThis movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, &quot;Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world.&quot; Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.<br/><br/>For me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven&#39;t been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song. And for another, they can remind themselves by value of this movi"

      "plot_summary": "Young Judy Hopps in Bunnyburrow dreams of becoming a police officer in Zootopia despite bullying from Gideon Grey. Years later she graduates the Zootopia Police Academy as valedictorian but is assigned to parking duty by Chief Bogo. Judy tickets 200 cars in a day, then pursues Duke Weaselton for plant bulb theft and volunteers to investigate the case of 14 missing predators after Mrs. Otterton brings Emmitt Otterton's disappearance to the station. Assistant Mayor Bellwether authorizes Judy under the condition she solve it within 48 hours. A photo links Emmitt to con artist Nick Wilde, whom Judy coerces into helping by recording him confessing to tax fraud. Judy and Nick follow leads: the Oasis (meeting naturist yak Yax and elephant yoga instructor Nangi), a DMV run by sloths to trace a limo plate, and a limo owned by crime boss Mr. Big. Mr. Big reveals Otterton went \"savage\" and that he was last seen at the limo; Manchas, the chauffeur, later also goes savage and chases Judy and Nick until Manchas vanishes. Chief Bogo pressures Judy to resign, but she keeps investigating with Nick. Nick tells Judy his origin: bullied as a child scout, he became a con artist. Using traffic camera footage provided by Bellwether, Judy and Nick deduce wolves captured Manchas, but the wolves' van goes missing in a tunnel. They find the missing predators held at Cliffside Asylum, and evidence implicates Mayor Lionheart in hiding them; Judy transmits proof and Lionheart is arrested. Bellwether becomes mayor. At a press conference Judy speculates predators' biology causes savagery; her comment sparks citywide fear and predator discrimination, and Nick walks out. Judy, guilt-ridden, quits and returns to Bunnyburrow, where Gideon Grey apologizes and tells her that \"night howlers\" are a plant with a toxic psychotropic bulb. Judy returns to Zootopia, reconciles with Nick, and they trace the night howler bulbs to Duke Weaselton who points them to Doug, a ram chemist working in Bellwether's employ. Judy and Nick storm Doug's subterranean lab, seize a dart gun and serum, and flee through the subway pursued by Doug's henchmen. At the Natural History Museum Bellwether and two rams (Jesse and Woolter) intercept them; Bellwether reveals she engineered the predator panic to install a prey-dominated regime, using night howler-derived serum to make predators \"go savage\" and then framing the attacks to seize power. Bellwether fires a dart meant to make Nick attack Judy, but Nick had replaced the serum pellets with blueberries; Judy records Bellwether's confession on her recorder. Chief Bogo and ZPD arrive; Bellwether is arrested. Lionheart claims he hid the victims to protect Zootopia; an antidote is developed for the serum and the victims recover. Judy rejoins ZPD and recruits Nick as the first fox officer and her partner. The film ends with Judy and Nick pulling over Flash the sloth for speeding, establishing their partnership and restored public trust.",

slashing her in the face. he leaves and, though she's hurt, judy shows her friends the tickets she got back and declares that she doesn't know when to quit. years later, judy hopps (ginnifer goodwin), a rabbit from rural bunnyburrow, fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban zootopia. judy is tiny compared to the other recruits and faces difficulties managing the obstacle courses run by the drill sergeant (fuschia!). but through sheer determination, and by using her wits, judy makes it to graduation as valedictorian. zootopia mayor lionheart (j.k. simmons) oversees the ceremony and assistant mayor bellwether (jenny slate), a sheep, formally congratulates judy as the first bunny police officer, saying it's a big day for all small animals. a few days after, judy, her parents, and many siblings head to the train station. stu convinces judy to take a can of fox repellent with her before she gets on the train to zootopia. judy listens to a hit by pop singer, gazelle (shakira), as she zooms through the diverse districts of the city, from the frozen tundra to the sultry rain-forest. she finds her apartment, a run-down single room with a rickety bed, paper-thin walls, and two noisy neighbors, bucky (byron howard) and pronk oryx-antlerson ( jared bush). despite being the police academy valedictorian, judy is relegated to parking duty by chief bogo (idris elba), who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. judy is disappointed but sets her standards high and uses her sharp ears to help her write 200 tickets before noon. on her first day at the zootopia police department / zpd, she is hustled by nick wilde (jason bateman) and finnick (tom lister jr.), a con artist duo of foxes. finnick acts as a child, who is desperate to get a jumbo pop on his birthday. nick is acting his father. they con judy into buying them a jumbo pop, which they later melt and refreeze into hundreds of mini pops which they sell to school kids, on which they make a healthy profit. the pop sticks, they sell to a rat construction site, selling it as red-wood. judy observes the whole operation and later confronts nick. nick doesn't deny that he's a hustler but provides judy with all the paperwork he needs to make his endeavors technically legal and humbles her by saying that the city is not a magical land where dreams come true and a meter maid can never be a real cop. the next day, judy abandons parking duty to arrest duke weaselton (alan tudyk), a thief who stole plant crocus bulbs. bogo reprimands her for abandoning her post (as the parking ticket officer). an otter named mrs. otterton (octavia spencer) enters bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. judy volunteers, and bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination.\nthe city's assistant mayor, ewe dawn bellwether (jenny slate) arrives at the station and otterton pleads her case to bellwether and says how judy volunteered to help her. bellwether praises judy for taking the assignment, bogo agrees but demands judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours. after determining nick was the last one to see otterton. on the last seen photo of emmit, judy notices that nick is eating a popsicle which looks exactly like what nick was selling the other day. judy blackmails nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion. he then takes them into the oasis to find emmitt's yoga instructor, an elephant named nangi (gita reddy), and judy is shocked to find the oasis is a haven for naturalists or nude animals. nangi has no memory of otterton, but yax unwittingly gives judy all the information she needs, including the plate number for the car otterton was picked up in the last time he was there. nick says he has a friend at the dmv who can help them run the plate number. there, judy is disheartened to see that the dmv is run solely by sloths. by the time they exit, it's nighttime. they track a limousine that picked up emmitt. they search it, finding polar bear fur, claw marks all over the back seat, and otterton's wallet. nick recognizes an insignia on a drinking glass and realizes that the vehicle is owned by mr. big (maurice lamarche), an arctic shrew crime boss whom nick has a history with. nick sold him an expensive rug made from the fur of a skunk's behind. mr big's henchmen capture nick and judy and bring them to big. big berates nick for tarnishing his trust and the hospitality of his grandmother who he recently buried in the skunk rug and scolds him for returning on the day of his daughter's wedding. mr. big orders his bears to 'ice' nick and judy and they're held over a trap door in the floor that reveals icy water. mr. big's daughter, fru fru (leah latham), then walks in wearing her wedding dress and recognizes judy as the bunny that saved her the previous day from being crushed by the doughnut.\nmr. big reveals that otterton was his florist, but he went \"savage\", reverted to a feral state, and attacked his chauffeur, manchas (jesse corti). at his home, manchas mentions that otterton had been yelling about \"night howlers.\" moments later, manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. judy saves nick by trapping manchas and calls the zpd for help. when bogo and other police arrive, however, manchas had vanished. bogo demands judy's resignation, but nick reminds bogo she still has 10 hours to solve the case.\nover the rain-forest, nick explains that he was idealistic like judy once. as a kid, he wanted nothing more than to join the junior ranger scouts. his mother bought him a new uniform and he was excited to become part of the group, despite the fact that he was the only predator to join. upon arriving, however, the other animals bullied and muzzled him, saying that he was stupid for thinking they'd trust a fox. after that day he decided he would never let anyone see that they had gotten to him and if people only thought of foxes as untrustworthy, then that's what he would be. deciding there was no use in fighting prejudiced ideas about fox behavior, he became a con artist. judy recalls that assistant mayor bellwether offered to help them. bellwether gives judy and nick access to the city's traffic-camera system. they discover manchas was captured by wolves, which judy surmises are the \"night howlers\". they watch as the wolves' van drives through a tunnel but fails to come out the other side. nick says that there's a maintenance tunnel and, if he were to do anything illegal, that's the route he'd take to avoid observation. they find otterton and the other missing predators imprisoned at cliffside asylum, where mayor leodore lionheart (j. k. simmons) is keeping them hidden from the public, while a scientist tries to determine the cause of their strange behavior. the doctor has no answer and says that they must come forward to chief bogo but the mayor refuses, saying his reputation as a predator official is at stake. nick and judy manage to get the evidence judy recorded back to bogo. lionheart and those involved are arrested and bellwether becomes the new mayor. lionheart protests that they still don't know why predators are going savage and he was trying to protect the public. judy, praised for solving the case and now friends with nick, asks him to join the zpd as her partner. however, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a biological cause for the recent savage behavior. at a press conference, she accidentally implies the savageness epidemic was caused by the physiology that all predators possess. disappointed and offended, nick abandons judy, whose comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout zootopia. a wedge is driven between the predator and prey populations, with prey acting fearful against all predators. gazelle hosts a peaceful protest against discrimination, despite backlash, and savage attacks continue in the city as more predators go primal.\ntv network znn covers singer gazelle's (shakira) peace protest and the police misconduct against predators. bellwether explains that with the population in zootopia being 90% prey, she wants judy as the face of the zpd to inspire hope. but, wracked with guilt, judy quits her job and returns to bunnyburrow. back in bunnyburrow, judy's parents explain that they've partnered up with gideon and never would have done so had judy not opened their eyes. gideon is red fox from bunnyburrow who used to bully the young rabbits and sheep when he was young. as an adult, he has made amends with those he picked on and became a much-respected baker. gideon apologizes to judy for what he did when he was younger, stating that his own insecurities manifested into unchecked rage, but judy forgives him and says she knows a thing or two about being a jerk. judy learns from her parents and her reformed childhood bully gideon grey (phil johnston) that \"night howlers\" are not wolves, but actually toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals. after she returns to zootopia and reconciles with nick, they confront weaselton, who tells them the night howler bulbs he'd stolen earlier were for a ram named doug (rich moore) an emotionless ram chemist and sniper with puffy wool who works for assistant mayor bellwether. they find doug in a lab hidden in the subway tunnels, creating an illegal drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a dart gun. he loads a pellet into a gun as his phone rings, telling him his next mark is a cheetah in sahara square. he assures the caller he can make the hit since he was able to get an otter in a moving car. judy and nick obtain the dart gun and the serum and escape the facility in a car. they are chased by doug's ram henchmen. after a fight, nick manages to save the evidence as he and judy defeat the henchmen jesse and woolter pursuing them. they run upstairs out of the station and into the natural history museum, empty due to renovations. as they near the exit toward the police station they are called from behind by mayor bellwether, accompanied by two rams in police uniform. these rams are jesse and woolter. but before they can go to the zpd, bellwether confronts them and steals the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy. bellwether calls out to judy, saying that in the city prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. they need to band together to end their mistreatment against the more powerful and loud predators and, once united, will be unstoppable. bellwether calls the police and feigns alarm, saying officer judy is down and being attacked by a savage fox. bellwether says that fear always works and, with a predisposition to savagery, predators will be forced out of zootopia, and she'll dart everyone to keep it that way. judy and nick are trapped in a pit after nick refuses to abandon judy when she is injured. bellwether shoots a serum pellet at nick to make him kill judy, but nick had disarmed bellwether's dart gun by replacing the serum pellets with blueberries. enraged, bellwether threatens to frame judy and nick for the attacks like she framed lionheart, but judy has recorded bellwether's confession on her pen recorder. bogo and the zpd arrive, and bellwether is arrested. in the news coverage that follows, former mayor lionheart gives an interview where he says he didn't know about bellwether's plot and only caged the savage predators to protect the city, citing he did a wrong thing for the right reasons. it is announced that an antidote has been created with positive effects. judy goes to the hospital where she sees emmitt otterton recovering and embracing his concerned wife. judy rejoins the zpd, and nick becomes the city's first fox police officer, as well as her partner. the next day, chief bogo hands out assignments, giving nick and judy the task of catching a hot-rod tearing up the roads downtown. judy and nick come across the speeder in their patrol car and pull him over, surprised to see flash the sloth behind the wheel."

        "text": "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you&#39;d be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands&#39; competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What&#39;s more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black&#39;s over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!"

Absolutely.  Is his humor and delivery similar to the great John Belushi?  Yes, down to the arching eyebrows.  And I say SO WHAT? Jack Black is hilarious in this movie and director Richard Linklater (the underappreciated gem &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;) uses his spot-on observations of Rock music and school days to deliver a wonderful film going experience. Writer Mike White (&quot;The Good Girl&quot;) also plays Black&#39;s wimpy friend and former bandmate.  Although his acting is fine, it is White&#39;s writing that will make him rich in Hollywood.  The kids in the band are wonderfully cast and appear to be very talented musically as well.  Special recognition to Joan Cusack, who just nails the role of the uptight private school principal who is just itching to be unleashed.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the Rock History tossed in for the sake of today&#39;s youngsters, but the tributes to Pete Townsend, Jimi Hendrix, Zeppelin and the Ramones are much appreciated.  Look for Nikki Katt in a brief role, but mostly just sit back and enjoy a pure comedy that truly ROCKS!!"

The movie was well-made for the time and it&#39;s not only about a fake teacher/wannabe rock star trying to get a job and make quick money and instead ends up teaching rock and roll to kids at a private school, but about young individuals learning to uncover their hidden talent, foster a sense of self-confidence, and express themselves in a fun artistic way! The extras in the film did well too and I can see why Miranda Cosgrove was chosen to play Megan in Drake and Josh since she acted brilliantly as a young girl in this movie as well."

Worrying about the &quot;messages&quot; this movie is delivering? Come on, there is no way that the con that Jack Black&#39;s character pulls off could ever get far in the real world! I don&#39;t think any sane person watching this movie would take this seriously. This is a comedy, for crying out loud, made to make us laugh!<br/><br/>I thought Black was fine in this movie. Sure, maybe his character is a little one-note with his proclamations of &quot;rock on&quot; and &quot;stick it to the man&quot;, but Black somehow manages to do it over and over without being boring. He&#39;s unbelievably energetic AND versatile, delivering these same things in different ways each time that prevent the movie from getting into a rut. I think it&#39;s safe to say that only Black himself could have made this role work so well.<br/><br/>There is plenty of humor and great music. Even my senior citizen parents kept laughing, and told me after it was over that they enjoyed the rock soundtrack as well. It&#39;s a great movie for the whole family. Why was this rated PG-13? Sure, there are some references to stuff like alcohol and groupies, but they are not emphasized at all in their brief passing - and your kids will already have seen these kind of things treated much worse elsewhere! In fact, here in British Columbia, the ratings board gave it a &quot;G&quot; rating."

        "text": "The perfect vehicle for Jack Black, a film to show that given the right material he&#39;s a bona fide comedic actor of some worth. Plot has Black as Dewey Finn, a wastrel musician who has no job prospects and who spends his time mooching off of his best mate Ned Sheebly (Mike White). When Dewey is fired from his rock band he&#39;s left in limbo and in danger of being homeless. But when he answers a phone call offering Ned a job assignment, Dewey decides to take it upon himself to impersonate Ned and take the employment himself; as a schoolteacher!<br/><br/>So it&#39;s Jack Black in a classroom full of kids, it probably shouldn&#39;t work, and even might seem like some sort of cruel and unusual punishment to anyone with an aversion to Black, but this is feel good nirvana and a paean to rock and roll. It&#39;s perhaps unsurprising that it&#39;s crammed with clichés from the classroom splinter of moviedom, the kids a roll call of characters we have seen numerous times. The spoilt swot, the roughneck, the one suffering parental peer pressure, the weight issue one and on it goes, but boy can they play music when Dewey takes them out of classical mode and into rock central.<br/><br/>How nice to find that director Richard Linklater and writer Mike White have managed to rise above the clichés and avoid syrupy fodder, there&#39;s such a zest and earnestness to it all, and the kids acting is high in quality as well, led by the big kid himself, Black on full tilt. But most of all, even as the morals and life affirming threads come wading in with the pulsing rock soundtrack, it&#39;s a very funny picture, the gag quota enormously high. Be it Black trying to bluff the kids, the kids trying to bluff everyone else - or the wonderful Joan Cusack as the scatty stickler for the rules Principal Mullins – a laugh is never far away. Rock on! 8.5/10"

You simply cannot see any actor-musician in the role of Dewey Finn besides Black. Jared Leto? No way.<br/><br/>Not that this is Black&#39;s best performance. That would probably have to be &quot;Bernie&quot;. But this is the only film where Black really gets to be Black and it propels the story, makes him out to be a hero.

This is Jack Black at his best and I feel privileged to be alive while this guy&#39;s star continues to skyrocket! <br/><br/>Dewey Finn (Jack Black) loves rock and roll. He is the consummate fan who knows every worthwhile group and song. He is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist in his own band called &quot;No Vacancy.&quot; But other members of the group have grown tired of his immature stage antics, such as 20-minute solos and stage-dives. They vote him out and hire someone to replace him for an upcoming Battle of the Bands contest.<br/><br/>Downcast and distraught, Dewey doesn&#39;t know what to do. Plus, his usually patient roommate Ned (Mike White), a schoolteacher, is being pressured by his aggressive girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) to make Dewey pay the money he owes for rent or get out. When a call comes in to Ned asking him to serve as a substitute teacher at the prestigious Horace Green Elementary School, Dewey decides to assume his identity and take the job.<br/><br/>Of course, faced with a class of fifth-graders all nicely clothed in their school uniforms, this rocker doesn&#39;t have a clue as to what to do. So he tells them to chill out and enjoy some downtime. This scheme works for a little while but then Dewey visits the orchestra class. Lights go off in his head and bingo! -- the new class project is to form a rock band. He decides to teach them everything he knows about rock with lectures on its history, the evils of &quot;The Man,&quot; and the essentials of playing rock songs.<br/><br/>Dewey&#39;s spirits are lifted when he realizes that there are some talented musicians in the class including Zack (Joey Gaydos, Jr.), the lead guitarist; Katie (Rebecca Brown) on bass; and Lawrence (Robert Tsai) on keyboards. Freddy (Kevin Clark), the class rebel, turns out to be an eager learner on drums, and Tomika (Maryam Hassan) surprises him with her unusual singing talent. The smartest girl in the class, Summer (Miranda Cosgrove), gets her chance to excel as band manager while others serve as back-up singers, special effects wizard, head of security, and the official selectors of the band&#39;s name.<br/><br/>The humor quotient of the film is heightened by the funny performance of Joan Cusack as the uptight and unlocked principal of Horace Green Elementary School. When Dewey discovers that she is a secret fan of Fleetwood Mac, they are able to connect as friends. The rock fan gets his wish when he has the class entered in the local Battle of the Bands. By the end of this rollicking film, you&#39;ll happily be chanting, &quot;For those about to rock, we salute you!&quot;<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"

        "text": "After distinguishing himself in any number of memorable supporting roles, Jack Black finally comes into his own in &quot;The School of Rock,&quot; a sporadically funny comedy that is part &quot;Sister Act&quot; and part genial spoof of all those movies about a &quot;super teacher&quot; who brings meaning and purpose to the lives of his students.<br/><br/>Black plays Dewey Finn, an aging rock&#39;n&#39;roller who is still awaiting that moment when he will &quot;make it big&quot; in the music world. He lives with Ned Schneebly, his longtime rocker buddy, who has traded in his dreams of musical glory for a nagging girlfriend and a job as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money to pay the rent, Dewey pretends to be Schneebly and takes a job as a sub at a snooty, tradition-bound prep school, where the last thing the administration and the parents would want is a Jimmy Hendricks knockoff teaching their kids. And since Dewey really only knows one thing, this uncredentialed professorial imposter decides to make rock&#39;n&#39;roll the sole focus of his curriculum, turning these inward, shy, nerdish kids into a viable rock band - all under the radar screen of the ever-watchful administrators and parents of course.<br/><br/>Although the storyline wends its way along a predictable path, writer Mike White and director Richard Linklater find a great deal of warmth and humor in the material. Dewey&#39;s utter obsession with rock music and rock history is reflected in the fact that he leads the band members in a prayer to the &quot;god of rock&quot; before a concert, and screams in frustration - &quot;What have they been teaching you kids at this school?&quot; - when he finds out his pupils have never been educated in the basics of Hendricks, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Dewey is so preposterously well-meaning and good-natured that the audience can&#39;t help but root for him and his students as they embark on their mad quest to appear at a local battle of the bands competition, unbeknownst to the powers-that-be at the school.<br/><br/>The children playing the students are all winning and charming, and Joan Cusack cuts a sympathetic figure as the uptight school principal who harbors a little bit of Stevie Nicks under her prim and proper exterior. But it is Black who makes this film his own, turning what might have been a buffoonish caricature into a fully-rounded human being. Black is not afraid to cut loose and take over the screen when necessary, hitting heights of unbridled mania to rival the master, Jim Carrey. Yet, he also realizes that he is part of an ensemble effort here and understands the importance of integrating himself into the material and not always dominating it. As a result, even when certain elements of the film fall flat, as they frequently do, Black is always there to prop the movie back up.<br/><br/>&quot;The School of Rock&quot; is an entertaining little comedy, but unlike a real satire which would skewer the conventions of the genre it is attacking, this film loses its nerve and winds up endorsing those conventions. Dewey, for all his talk about defying &quot;The Man,&quot; is really a rebel in name only, and the film reflects the kind of feel-good populism that no true hard line iconoclast would be caught dead supporting. I guess it&#39;s too much to expect a mainstream Hollywood comedy to launch a truly savage assault on mainstream values (in the way rock, at its best, often does). Still, it might be nice to come across the unexpected sometime (after all, movies like &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;MASH&quot; were able to do it).<br/><br/>Until then, we&#39;ll settle for what we can get. And Jack Black is good enough for now."

Evicted roommate Ned Schneebly, pressured by his girlfriend Patty Di Marco, is offered a short substitute-teacher job at Horace Green Prep; Dewey impersonates Ned to take the gig to pay rent. At Horace Green Dewey introduces himself as \"Mr. S.\", ignores standard discipline, and discovers his fourth-grade class has musical talent (notably guitarist Zack Mooneyham, drummer Freddy Jones, pianist Lawrence, bassist Billy, lead singer Katie, and manager Summer Hathaway). Dewey secretly converts classroom time into rock lessons and rehearsals, teaching rock history and performance while hiding the band plan from Principal Rosalie Mullins and the parents. He bonds with Rosalie outside school by playing her favorite song and gaining her trust. Dewey enters the kids in the local Battle of the Bands to win $20,000 and reinstate himself in the music world; Summer negotiates the band's late entry by lying that the children are orphans with an illness so they can perform. The deception unravels when Ned receives a Horace Green paycheck, calls the school, and Dewey admits the impersonation to Ned; Patty exposes him at a parents' meeting and the police and Ned confront Dewey. Rosalie learns Dewey is an impostor and fires him. The students, determined to play, secretly go to the Battle of the Bands; Summer rallies them and convinces Dewey to come. Ned stands up to Patty and goes to the show. Onstage, the student band—now named School of Rock—performs an original song by Zack and wins the crowd despite losing the official contest to No Vacancy. Public pressure forces an encore; the band returns and plays AC/DC's \"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\". Afterwards Rosalie opens an after-school program called the School of Rock where Dewey coaches the band and Ned teaches beginner music, while the class continues performing together.",

      "dewey finn (jack black) is a guitarist of an unpopular rock band no vacancy. dewey's arrogance and hyperactive stage antics causes various disadvantages for the band mates. the next day, no vacancy votes dewey out of the band and replaces him with another guitarist named spider (lucas babin). furthermore, dewey's submissive roommate and lifelong friend, ned schneebly (mike white), is pressured by his girlfriend, patty di marco (sarah silverman), to evict dewey unless he gets a real job to pay back his growing rent debt. dewey thinks about having to quit music until he receives an urgent phone call intended for ned from rosalie mullins (joan cusack), the principal of a prestigious prep school, horace green, asking ned to replace for a teacher who broke her leg. desperate for income to avoid getting evicted, dewey impersonates ned and takes the substitute teacher position for a fourth-grade class. upon appearing in the classroom, he requests the students to call him \"mr. s.\" after failing to spell \"schneebly\" on the blackboard. however, dewey incapably resorts to grimacing over his rental problems and being unemployed and allows his students to do anything they wish. occasionally, dewey gives casual and non-motivational lectures to the class. when dewey overhears his students playing in music class, he thinks that the children of his class are musically talented and decides to make his personal project by converting the class into a rock band and crew to serve as a vehicle to stardom by winning the upcoming battle of the bands, where he is out to avenge his eviction from his old band and win the $20,000 prize. when dewey realizes the kids are mostly interested in pop and hip-hop, he turns the school days into lessons of rock history as well as playing rock music, exposing his students to those artists he regards as rock legends. many rock legends are featured in classic photos and footage during a montage scene, including led zeppelin, the ramones, jimi hendrix, pink floyd, iggy pop, the who, rush, the clash, nirvana, ac/dc, black sabbath and david bowie. dewey narrowly avoids detection when rosalie decides to attend one of his class' lessons to check on their progress, forcing him to attempt to teach the actual course material. dewey attempts to make friends with her through rock music, by playing her favorite song \"edge of seventeen\" by stevie nicks on a jukebox while visiting a bar. the two become close friends and the class auditions for battle of the bands, which dewey informed them was their \"school project\". they are rejected because they show up too late despite the bill being full. with the help of class factotum and band manager summer hathaway (miranda cosgrove), dewey persuades the venue's managers to allow the students perform in battle of the bands by lying that the students are orphans and have been diagnosed with a blood disease. dewey becomes exposed when the real ned receives a paycheck from horace green in the mail, although he doesn't work there. he attempts to call the school about this, but dewey breaks the call and confesses everything to ned. he urges ned not to inform patty, but she manages to reveal the truth out of ned. during a parents' meeting later on, dewey meets the students' parents, who initially scrutinize dewey's teaching abilities, utilizing the fact that their children were becoming more engrossed in music rather than the usual schoolwork. ned eventually appears with the police and confronts dewey under pressure from patty. when rosalie appears, his real identity is revealed, causing dewey to become dismissed. back at his apartment, both dewey and patty argue who each should blame until ned intervenes and suggests that dewey should move out. the next day, the class decides they have still put too much work into not do the final show at battle of the bands, so summer arranges the class trip. they stop at dewey's apartment in an attempt to give him new energy and have him join them. rosalie discovers the children leave for the concert and informs their parents who are all in her office wanting answers from the events of the previous day. the parents and rosalie, informed by a phone call from patty, head to the concert venue to take their kids back. meanwhile, ned eventually stands up to patty and leaves her to go to the concert, much to her extreme dismay. at the concert, the band plays their eponymous song, written by their lead guitarist, zack mooneyham (joey gaydos jr.). regardless of the audience's reception and winning over the crowd, school of rock loses to no vacancy, but accept their defeat due to dewey's earlier proclamation that they were there not to win but rather to play \"one great show\". however, the audience (except one member) becomes distressed by no vacancy's winning acceptance and demand school of rock for an encore. the band returns to the stage to play a cover of \"it's a long way to the top (if you wanna rock 'n' roll)\" by ac/dc with an altered ending. the song segues into the film's closing credits. summer is seen calling on her cell phone as she enters the school of rock, a newly opened after-school program where dewey continues to coach the band itself while ned teaches beginner music students. the closing credits roll as the class, breaking the fourth wall, sings \"the movie is over, but we're still on screen.\""

Watching this 8 years later as a grown adult, I can say that I totally understand why this movie became a phenomenon.<br/><br/>Frozen has three big things going for it...the songs, the characters and the interesting subversion of tropes. I personally don&#39;t *love* all of them, but the musical numbers give the movie a bouncy, fun vibe. The characters are lovable and well written; it&#39;s hard not to like SOMEONE here, if not the entire roster of characters.<br/><br/>The Bad: I don&#39;t think the movie does a great job with establishing the central conflict. Despite the first portion of the movie covering it, by the time the movie gets into it, I just didn&#39;t buy the relationship between Anna and Elsa until the halfway mark of the movie. Anna&#39;s motivations are quite poor and while I get that we wouldn&#39;t have a movie without this central conflict, it could have been communicated with a bit more patience.<br/><br/>This might also be a nitpick, but I also felt the environment lacked a real presence; Arendelle sort of gave me &quot;Asgard&quot; vibes, which means: devoid of people, we move on from it too fast and it doesn&#39;t feel like a living breathing world. Maybe it&#39;s the cold setting, but I prefer my fantasy worlds to be brimming with life and character.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Yeah, it&#39;s good. I still think Let It Go is a bit overrated and I&#39;ve definitely seen better looking animated films, but Frozen is a solid movie and fun for the whole family."

And the &quot;In Summer&quot; song with the snow man in summer is pretty cute, if not a little jarringly placed! But, catchy.<br/><br/>Having said that, some people on these reviews are taking this way too seriously. Why would you give it one star just because other people liked it enough to give it a 10? Is that too show how much smarter you are than everyone else? It really shows nothing but taking a carton movie too seriously instead of just going with the flow. It&#39;s not real.

This isn&#39;t really a criticism--I am just trying to clarify the film a bit.<br/><br/>The story is about two sisters--one who eventually becomes queen and one who is her younger sister, a princess. However, the Queen, Elsa (Idina Menzel), has a huge problem that is never really explained in the film--she has magical powers to make things frozen as well as to create snow. While this seems great, it&#39;s also a dangerous power and one she cannot fully control--and she COULD accidentally kill someone. Once she becomes queen, the power is exposed--and she disappears into the mountains to live life apart from others.<br/><br/>The younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), decides to do what any responsible lady would do in this situation--abandon her kingdom and give control of it to an almost complete stranger! Why she didn&#39;t just send some of her people out to find Elsa is beyond me. Regardless, along the way she meets a guy who is to become an obvious love interest and together they seek out Elsa and try to bring her back to the kingdom. After all, since Elsa&#39;s departure, the place has been bathed in perpetual winter! <br/><br/>The film is glorious to watch--particularly on the big screen. The CGI is absolutely lovely as are the character designs. However, it&#39;s a film that looks great but whose story is less than stellar. Part of it is because the characters sometimes do inexplicable things (mentioned above), part of it is because parts of the plot are missing (such as explaining how everyone LOVED the interim leader yet hated him later--after he&#39;d actually done a good job in regard to the people as well as why everyone suddenly hated the guy from Weaseltown) and part of it is because there were too many distractions when the main thrust SHOULD have been the relationship between the sisters (the reindeer and guys got in the way). Still, it is worth seeing--especially if you don&#39;t spend too much time thinking through the plot. Plus, many might enjoy the more Broadway style of the music, as Idina Menzel really pours it on when she sings (as do the rest, though she clearly overshadows them with her magnificent singing)."

        "text": "The directorial duo managed to make another Disney animated film an event. Thanks to the fact that they shared the responsibilities very well, they managed to develop a simple story through characters, music, humor and soul that goes into all the projects of this company.<br/><br/>The script, which began with Andersen&#39;s fairy tale, quickly turns into a disparate block. The writers use only a dramatic basis, which they turn into a completely different story. A distinctive feature of any Disney project has always been not plots, but the subtle skill of artists, the ability of screenwriters to create images, their ability to balance on the border between sad and funny."

        "summary": "Most Overrated Movie of 2013",
        "text": "I&#39;m an 18 year old girl, who is a HUGE Disney fan and loves watching what her friends deem &quot;little kid movies&quot;. I was looking for a way to celebrate finishing my first semester at college(in December), so I went to see Frozen, which had gotten great reviews. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was decent. Do You Want to Build a Snowman made me tear up and Kristen Bell and Santino Fontana&#39;s voices sounded like they were made for each other in Love is an Open Door. However, the positivity stops there. At the end of Love is an Open Door, when Prince Hans asks Anna to marry him, I immediately KNEW that something was wrong and that this was an attempt to mock the Disney &quot;love-at- first-sight&quot; cliché. Now, before I continue, I&#39;d just like to point out that I am ridiculously sick of people praising Elsa for being the first Disney princess to say &quot;You can&#39;t marry a man you just met&quot;.<br/><br/>1) This is a result of people on the internet poking fun at Disney Princess movies. However, if those people even bothered to REALLY watch them, they&#39;d realize that although this movie may be the first to explicitly state that girls shouldn&#39;t marry someone they just met, this is not a new concept in the Disney world. In fact, I don&#39;t recall Pocahontas, Mulan, Rapunzel, Tiana, Jasmine, or Belle marrying men that they just met. <br/><br/>2) Re-watch that scene. She only said that because she was worried about Hans&#39; brothers staying over for the wedding and having yet another social event that she&#39;d be required to attend. She panics and says &quot;No one&#39;s brothers are staying here. No one&#39;s getting married&quot;. See her priorities? Elsa&#39;s reason for not blessing their marriage doesn&#39;t stem from their quick engagement. It&#39;s much more self-centered than that. <br/><br/>Next, let&#39;s not forget the plot holes, the most obvious one being the anti-climatic ending: &quot;Of course...Love!&quot; Sorry, what? Elsa trying to protect Anna from herself wasn&#39;t love? Besides, why does Elsa even have powers? Why are there trolls and where did they come from? Why did Prince Hans protect Elsa if he wanted her dead? He could have been &quot;distracted&quot; when the guard was trying to kill Elsa. Why does Olaf come to life and where has he been the entire time the girls were growing up? Maybe the directors should have paid less attention to casting *famous* people and more to making a good plot. (Casting complaint: Elsa looked like she was in her mid-twenties and sounded old enough to be Anna&#39;s mother.)<br/><br/>Anyways, moving on to my next complaint: Olaf, the snowman AKA my least favorite character in the entire movie. His awkward attempts at jokes and sheer stupidity were torturous to sit through. In Summer was one of the worst songs in the movie, right up there with Fixer Upper. What is Fixer Upper even promoting? Cheating?!?! Because that&#39;s what I thought as the trolls sang about getting Anna&#39;s fiancé out of the way. Also, I could not stand how Anna flirted with and almost MARRIED Kristoff while engaged to Hans. Luckily for her, Prince Hans just *happened* to be a villain. How very convenient (and completely unnecessary). Elsa, having been alone her entire life, could have used a love story and Kristoff would have been the perfect match for her. Elsa and Kristoff could have bonded over her powers and his love for ice. Instead, Kristoff and Anna ended up being an extremely weak, unlikeable rip-off of Flynn and Rapunzel. <br/><br/>Lastly, having watched Disney movies all my life, I have to say, this movie has the largest percentage of bad songs I&#39;ve ever seen in a single movie. &quot;Let it Go&quot; is the most overrated song I have EVER heard and I was quite disappointed to hear that it had won the Oscar for Best Original Song. The rhymes were unoriginal and it was not memorable at all, although after hearing people sing it 24/7, it does get ingrained into your brain. Some of the other songs were catchy, but there was still a HUGE lack of originality in the rhymes. Even my nine-year-old sister criticized the Frozen songwriters&#39; creativity, pointing out that they rhymed &quot;door&quot; and &quot;anymore&quot; in four songs (&quot;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&quot;, &quot;For the First Time in Forever&quot;, &quot;Love is an Open Door&quot;, and &quot;Let it Go&quot;). <br/><br/>To summarize, this movie was not deserving of the Oscars it won. Then again, there was not much competition this year. This movie was basically a slap in the face to all the Classic Disney Princess movies and is tied for #1 with Brave on my Worst Disney Princess Movies list. If you REALLY want to see a movie worth watching, I recommend Tangled, which is as underrated as Frozen is overrated. The songs, plot, and characters are much better developed and the whole movie is absolutely delightful. The music was beautifully composed and don&#39;t even get me started on how amazing Donna Murphy, Zachary Levi, and Mandy Moore&#39;s performances were! Whereas I will never re-watch Frozen, I re-watch Tangled every couple of months even though I can quote the entire movie and sing every song. I know many Tangled fans went to see Frozen - expecting it to be as good as Tangled- and were very disappointed. Disney may be gaining new fans, but they&#39;re losing their loyal fans. Look at Frozen&#39;s percentage of 1/10 ratings compared to those of Tangled. Until Disney gets their act together, I will not be wasting any more of my time watching these movies in theaters. As Zazu said, &quot;If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out&quot;.<br/><br/>tl;dr- Plot holes galore. Lackluster songs. Terrible morals/lessons. Save your money and time.<br/><br/>(Apparently 0/10 is not an option, so I&#39;ll give it one point for the animation.)"

        "summary": "A story that's all slush.",
        "text": "It is sort of disheartening going into Disney&#39;s production of &quot;Frozen&quot; to report that this is a project that Walt himself had been tinkering with as far back as the 40s, disheartening because the result falls far short of spectacular. After all these years, after all this effort, what has come to the screen is a dull, lackluster and fairly canned story that Uncle Walt would have most certainly demanded be rewritten.<br/><br/>What comes to the screen looks terrific. The animation is crisp and colorful. The ice-flows glisten in a magical way, but the story is disastrously underwritten. It plays like one of Disney&#39;s quickly-made DVD releases, or one of those classic fairy tales starring Barbie. Worse, it has musical numbers that are not only forgettable; they slow down the film&#39;s forward momentum. They&#39;re bad, and that ain&#39;t good.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson 1845 tale &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, the story takes place in the Nordic kingdom of Arendelle where Elsa (Idina Menzel) is born with a superpower that she doesn&#39;t want: Everything she touches turns to ice. With this gift, her royal parents reasonably do what any Disney parent would do, by keeping her power a secret and locking her up in her bedroom for life. Who wouldn&#39;t? Elsa&#39;s cold-weather Midas Touch eventually gets her banished from the kingdom when a wintry temper tantrum leads to disaster. Cast out into the cold, she heads off into the mountains where she builds herself a lonely castle in which to stew in her misery. Meanwhile, the winter-wonderland that she has left in her wake is (unbeknownst to her) turning out to be permanent.<br/><br/>That sets her sister Anna (Kristen Bell) off into the frozen wilderness to bring her disgraced sibling back. Her sidekicks include a hunky guide named Kristoff who runs an ice business, and a living, breathing snow man named Olaf (Josh Gad).<br/><br/>Olaf would seem to be the film&#39;s chief selling point. He&#39;s a cute motor-mouth with a silly wish that, given his molecular configuration, might prove fatal - he&#39;s unaware that snow melts in summer. Olaf is not one of the great Disney sidekicks. Unlike Goofy or The Genie or Dug the Dog, Olaf just feels manufactured and underwritten. He&#39;s also pointless to the rest of the story. He shows up halfway through the movie, sings a song and then has nowhere to go.<br/><br/>That&#39;s pretty much the problem with the entire movie. For everything right with the movie – the beautiful wintry landscapes – there is something that goes wrong – all the characters look like a line of Barbie dolls. The music is dull, the characters are ill-defined and, while small children may enjoy it, their parents will be checking their watches.<br/><br/>If I sound a bit cold-hearted, it&#39;s only because I know that the quality of the Disney name deserves better. This is a professionally made, but lackluster musical fantasy that needed a better story, better characters and better music. After 70 years of toil and trouble, &quot;Frozen&quot; is all slush.<br/><br/>** (of four)"

      "plot_summary": "In a Scandinavian-styled kingdom of Arendelle, Princess Elsa (born with the power to create ice and snow) and her younger sister Anna play as children, conjuring a snowman they name Olaf. Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the head with magic, turning some of Anna's hair white. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, take the girls to the trolls led by Grand Pabbie, who heals Anna and erases her memory of Elsa's magic, warning Elsa to control her powers. The royal family withdraws into isolation; Elsa is taught to suppress her emotions and wear gloves, and the sisters grow apart. After their parents die at sea, the castle gates are opened for Elsa's coronation when she turns 21. During the coronation celebrations Anna meets Prince Hans of the Southern Isles and impulsively becomes engaged to him that night. When Anna and Hans announce their engagement to Elsa, Elsa refuses and, in a confrontation, loses control; she exposes her powers to the crowd, creates an ice barrier, and flees across the fjord. In her flight she accidentally plunges Arendelle into an eternal winter. Accused of witchcraft by the Duke of Weselton, Elsa retreats to the North Mountain and builds an ice palace where, free from restraint, she discovers she can create without fear.\n\nAnna volunteers to find Elsa and end the winter. She travels to the mountains, buys supplies at Wandering Oaken's, then hires ice-harvester Kristoff and his reindeer Sven to guide her. They are joined by Olaf, the living snowman Elsa inadvertently created. At Elsa's ice palace Anna begs her to return to Arendelle; during an emotional exchange Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the heart with magic. Elsa panics, creates a giant snow guardian (Marshmallow) and drives them from the palace. Kristoff takes the wounded Anna to the trolls, who examine her and tell them Anna's heart is frozen; only an \"act of true love\" can thaw it. Kristoff races Anna back toward Arendelle, believing Hans can save her.\n\nBack in Arendelle, the Duke organizes men to capture or kill Elsa. Hans and his captain reach Elsa's palace and subdue her; she is brought back to Arendelle, imprisoned in the dungeon, and publicly accused. Hans pretends to help Anna but when confronted by Anna pleading for a true-love's kiss, Hans reveals his plot: as a youngest son whose family holds no throne, he courted Anna to marry into power, intending to let Anna die and then kill Elsa to seize the throne. He plans to declare himself protector and rule Arendelle. He leaves Anna to die while he organizes a summary execution of Elsa.\n\nElsa escapes her shackles, flees into the blizzard on the fjord and, distraught, unwittingly intensifies the storm enveloping Arendelle. Kristoff races back toward the city. Hans confronts Elsa on the frozen fjord and raises a sword to kill her; Anna intervenes by throwing herself between them and is struck by Hans's blade, freezing solid in the act. Anna's sacrifice—an act of true love for her sister—thaws her frozen heart and breaks the curse. Elsa, realizing love can control her powers, dispels the winter and restores summer. She also conjures a permanent flurry above Olaf so he can exist in warmth. Hans is arrested and sent back to the Southern Isles; the Duke of Weselton is rebuked. Elsa reopens the castle gates, names Kristoff royal ice harvester/deliverer, and Anna and Kristoff's relationship is confirmed with a kiss. The sisters reconcile: Elsa promises never to isolate herself again and to rule openly, ending Arendelle's winter and restoring the kingdom.",

      "in a winter landscape, ice harvesters use saws and hooks to cut blocks of ice from a lake, chanting as they work about how ice is a powerful force that's both beautiful and dangerous. they load the ice blocks onto their sled and ride off. they follow the northern lights through the sky, before panning down on a stave castle, located on the shores of a scandinavian fjord, ringed in by cliffs. elsa (idina menzel), princess of arendelle, possesses the ability to create ice and snow. elsa and her sister anna (kristen bell) decide to play in the winter snow and create a snowman. at anna's urging, elsa waves her hands, conjuring up a snow crystal, which she then shoots into the air. it explodes, raining snow down on them. to enhance the winter playground, she then stomps her foot, covering the entire floor with ice. they create a snowman that she nicknames olaf, who likes warm hugs. the girls play gleefully with olaf until anna makes a leap elsa wasn't prepared for and the blast of power meant to create a pile of snow hits anna in the head, knocking her out and turning several strands of her hair white. king agnarr of arendelle (maurice lamarche) and queen iduna (jennifer lee) seek help from trolls led by grand pabbie (ciaran hinds). agdar and his wife hastily load both girls onto their horses and ride at full speed into the mountains. the trolls heal anna and remove her memories of her sister's magic. grand pabbie observes that anna is lucky she was hit in the head, as a hit to the heart would have been fatal. he advises the family that it might be best if elsa doesn't use her powers around anna. grand pabbie warns elsa that her powers will grow, and although they are beautiful, they will be a great risk to her if she cannot learn to control them, as fear will be her greatest enemy. the royal couple then isolate the family in the castle and teach elsa to suppress her powers. the palace is closed to most visitors. staffing is reduced to a minimum. traumatized elsa spends most of her time in her room, afraid of hurting her sister again. anna, meanwhile, can't understand why her sister is shutting her out.\nwhile anna's life is dull but normal, elsa's powers grow stronger as she matures. her father cautions her to wear gloves to keep her icy magic in check, and to conceal her feelings, because strong emotions seem to cause her powers to manifest in unexpected ways.\nthey grow up lonely and estranged from each other. the rift between the two sisters even deepens after their parents are lost at sea in a storm. when elsa comes of age (when she turns 21), the kingdom prepares for her coronation and the castle gates open to the public for the first time. among the dignitaries is the duke of weselton (alan tudyk), a tradesman who wants to exploit the kingdom for profit. excited to be allowed out of the castle gates, anna explores the town and meets prince hans (santino fontana) of the southern isles, and they immediately develop a mutual attraction. elsa's coronation goes off without incident.\nanna's first friendly interaction with elsa in years brings quite the delightful feeling to anna, flustered at first, as well as seeing elsa so happy instead of serious and preserved boosts anna's confidence, prompting her to continue on with the conversation. the duke invites elsa for a dance, but she asks anna to accompany him instead. anna then takes to the floor with hans. the two of them quickly sneak off to spend the evening together, quickly realizing the mutual attraction between them. the romantic dance eventually leads to an entire date, with the entire night of the young couple being spent bonding. hans, during their time together, learns of anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting anna out one day when they were kids. hans then promises to never shut anna out unlike elsa, much to the princess' absolute joy.\nduring the reception, prince hans proposes marriage, and anna joyfully accepts. however, when they approach elsa, the queen forbids such a hasty marriage. elsa asks to speak to anna alone in private, likely to finally confess her abilities and why it's not wise to marry someone she just met without causing a scene that would expose her powers, but anna refuses any private conversation, stating whatever elsa has to say can be said to both her and hans. the sisters argue, and elsa is unable to control her emotions, culminating in her abilities being exposed to the guests. elsa makes a violent sweep with her left arm, causing a barrier of sharp icicles to suddenly appear around her. the whole town is afraid of the sudden display of these awesome powers & tries to shield themselves from elsa.\nelsa pleads for people to step back, moments before another bolt of ice shoots from her hands, nearly hitting the duke and his guards. she keeps running away, sprinting across the waters of the fjord, her feet forming an ice bridge, and vanishes into the forest on the other side of the fjord. panicked, elsa flees the palace, inadvertently unleashing an eternal winter on the kingdom in her wake. elsa is accused of witchcraft by the scheming duke of weselton. the duke of weselton declares they must take action and put an end to elsa's curse. anna, however, refuses and volunteers to seek out elsa herself and make things right, feeling that it's her fault for pushing her. elsa flees to the north mountain. high in the mountains far from arendelle, elsa casts off restraint and creates a solitary ice palace, and unknowingly brings to life her and anna's childhood snowman, olaf (josh gad). it is here she realizes that far away from what she was taught, being on her own, she can begin to control her powers. elsa changes her confining wardrobe into a shimmering dress, and vows to stay in seclusion, where she feels she can be herself, and harm no one else. anna sets out in search of her elder sister, leaving hans in command. anna is determined to return her to arendelle, end the winter, and mend their relationship.\nanna staggers through heavy snow to the cabin with the chimney, a place known as wandering oaken's trading post and sauna, run by its burly owner, oaken (chris williams). kristoff (jonathan groff) staggers in out of the storm, seeking to buy some rope, an ax, and carrots for sven. kristoff argues with oaken over the outrageous price gouging on the items he needs (due to oaken claiming that there's a supply and demand problem since kristoff is buying from the almost-bare shelves of the winter department), which ends with oaken roughly throwing kristoff out into the snow after kristoff makes the mistake of calling him a crook. kristoff and his reindeer sven take refuge in a barn on oaken's property, but are soon met by anna, who has bought kristoff's supplies for him, on condition he take her up the north mountain immediately. kristoff eventually agrees.\non the way the group encounters a pack of wolves and anna helps kristoff to fight them off. kristoff loses his sled when it falls off a cliff, and he is angry as he had just paid it off. kristoff and the others are now forced to walk. the group encounters olaf. anna doesn't recognize olaf until he gives his name. this jogs anna's memories and she remembers building him with elsa when they were young. anna and kristoff mention that they're looking for elsa so they can restore summertime, and olaf suddenly grows excited as it's his dream to see what summer is like, and he fantasizes about what he wants to do in the summertime. anna and kristoff choose not to reveal that he will melt in the summer heat, but follow him as he leads them to elsa's ice palace. when they get to the front door of elsa's palace, anna tells kristoff and olaf to wait outside, warning them that the last time she introduced elsa to a guy, she froze everything.\nanna and elsa are reunited, but elsa still fears hurting her sister. elsa is surprised to learn that her entire kingdom is frozen, and anna is surprised in turn to learn that elsa doesn't know how to stop it. but anna insists her sister's powers are no reason why they should be so distant. however, having seen olaf, elsa flashes back to accidentally hitting anna in the head with her snow abilities and grows scared, demanding anna leave. when anna tries to persuade her elder sister to return, elsa becomes agitated and accidentally strikes anna in the heart with her powers. she then creates a giant snow creature (that olaf calls marshmallow) to run the friends out of the ice castle. as they flee, kristoff notices that anna's hair is turning white. kristoff takes her to his family, who happen to be a group of rock trolls and the same ones that saved anna many years before. kristoff explains that as he had no family at a young age, the trolls took him and sven in.\ngrand pabbie comes forward and examines anna but concludes that this time her sister's powers struck her in the heart. they are told that anna's heart has been frozen, and unless it's thawed by \"an act of true love,\" she will become frozen solid forever. she weakly tells kristoff that hans can surely help, and they take off for arendelle. believing that only hans can save her, kristoff races back with her to arendelle. meanwhile, hans had gone on a search for anna. the duke of weselton volunteers his two bodyguards and secretly tells them to shoot elsa if they should encounter her. hans reaches elsa's castle and is attacked by marshmallow. hans is a skilled warrior and manages to defeat marshmallow. meanwhile, duke's men attack elsa, who defends herself and prepares to kill them.\nhans and his men show up just in time and hans pleads for her to stop, so she doesn't become the monster people accuse her of being. elsa settles down a bit at hans' words, realizing what she's doing. the guy pinned to the wall, still complying with the orders of the duke, aims his crossbow at elsa's head and prepares to shoot her. hans suddenly runs over and deflects the bow. the arrow is released and hits the bolt attaching an icy chandelier to the ceiling, which begins to fall straight for elsa's head. elsa tries to run, but the falling chandelier fragments and knocks her unconscious.\nhans brings her back to arendelle after she is knocked unconscious during a skirmish with the duke's men, shackling her in the dungeon. when anna is reunited with hans and begs him to kiss her to break the curse, hans refuses. hans explains that as the youngest of 13 brothers, he had no chance at claiming his family's throne, so he went looking for a royal family he could marry into. unable to get to elsa, he made anna's acquaintance and played on her naivete. he intended to marry her before causing some form of \"accident\" for elsa that would clear his path to the throne. however, given anna's current condition, he plans to simply let her frozen heart overcome her, then stab elsa, ending the eternal winter. leaving anna to die, hans goes to speak with the duke of weselton and several other dignitaries. he claims that elsa has caused anna to freeze to death, but before she died, he and anna recited their wedding vows. this apparently is enough to give him full authority to declare elsa guilty of treason and sentence her to death. elsa freezes her shackles to the point that they shatter, then breaks through the wall to the outside and heads out into the blizzard on the fjord. meanwhile, far from arendelle, kristoff and sven are trekking away when sven urges kristoff to go back. kristoff claims he has no need to, but as they look back at arendelle, a mysterious swirling cloud of snow begins to engulf the kingdom. the two then take off towards the growing danger. olaf finds anna and reveals kristoff is in love with her. olaf recalls how kristoff did so much to get her back to save her, when the wind blows a window open. olaf goes to close it, but in the distance, he sees kristoff and sven charging towards them. the two then travel together onto the fjord to find kristoff. hans confronts elsa and tells her anna is dead because of her actions. in elsa's despair, the storm suddenly stops, giving kristoff and anna the chance to reach each other. however, anna, seeing that hans is about to kill elsa, throws herself between the two and subsequently freezes solid, blocking the blow. as elsa grieves for her sister, anna begins to thaw as her decision to sacrifice herself to save her sister constitutes \"an act of true love.\" it is then that elsa realizes what can end the winter: love. and with this realization, she dissipates the ice and snow, and summer returns to the kingdom. olaf is found, and before he can melt, elsa creates a perpetual snow flurry above his head, which lets him survive the summer heat. hans is sent back to the southern isles to face punishment for his crimes against the royal family of arendelle, and the duke is told that elsa has cut off trade with weselton.\nelsa appoints kristoff the royal ice deliverer, and he and anna share a kiss. anna and kristoff share a kiss, and the two sisters reconcile, with elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again."

It is, partially, but I&#39;ve always viewed it as an amazingly well done parody.<br/><br/>It pokes fun of the fairy tale tropes while at the same time paying tribute to the genre. All the exaggeration about true love, evil princes, and torture chambers is on point. Its a self aware movie that plays up to its its biggest strength, the characters.<br/><br/>Every character in the film is memorable, even down to the preist who only has a few lines. The casting and writing of these characters all came together and it really shows. You just cant help but wish Wallace Shawn survived longer so his loveable villian character could get a little more screentime.<br/><br/>All in all, you should give this film a chance. Its a hilarious yet family friend entertaining ride that still holds up. As you wishhhhh!"

Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by three rogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).<br/><br/>This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk&#39;s feign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and Fred Savage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put together all the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. The characters are memorable.

        "text": "Princess Bride is something that is really special. It is well designed, well directed and well acted. Rob Reiner is a very good director indeed, directing films like Stand By Me and all that. The film itself is beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, matched with a funny and touching script, not to mention quotable. The story was simple, but very well-developed, with a few surprises here and there. As for the acting, it is superb. Cary Elwes is a very charismatic lead as Westley, and Robin Wright gives a very spirited performance as Princess Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is a little annoying, but he has some delicious throw-away lines, so you warm to him, especially when Westley insults him at the end. Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant and Christopher Guest(who bares a mere resemblance to Tim Curry&#39;s Cardinal Richelieu) were very good too, as is an unrecognisable Billy Crystal. And Mandy Patinkin is deliciously hammy as the man who wishes to avenge his father&#39;s death by killing his six-fingered murderer. But what impressed me most were the funny interruptions with the grandfather(played wonderfully by Colombo&#39;s Peter Falk)and his sick grandson(Fred Savage). All in all, an original and funny movie that is a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox."

        "text": "I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner&#39;s unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride, I was only 7 years old, and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable, I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience, and recently, I got the chance to view it, on the big screen, with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.<br/><br/>Personally, I am one of those people who, by nature, absorbs memorable quotes, and by that token, the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching, I could always hear somebody, if not more than one person, at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile, I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were pre-teens, teens, people in their twenties, thirties, and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight, I do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.<br/><br/>With a screenplay written by William Goldman (based on his book), The Princess Bride is a classic, familiar story of a princess, her true love, and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance, this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you, however, it is the film&#39;s whimsical, irreverent, pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you hang around people who love this film, do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation, &quot;Inconceivable!&quot; Likewise, if you tell them to just wait a minute, don&#39;t be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying, &quot;I hate waiting.&quot; And if you suddenly, from out of nowhere, hear, &quot;Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die,&quot; don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s not your fault, and you&#39;re not going to die.<br/><br/>While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults, the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale, and for this reason, there is a little something for everyone. In addition, the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories, even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.<br/><br/>A sick grandson (Fred Savage), who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic Atari 8-bit type), gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk). To the grandson&#39;s dismay, his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather&#39;s old-fashioned ways, the grandfather&#39;s response is, &quot;When I was your age, television was called books.&quot; Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.<br/><br/>The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom, but of course, as the reading of the story progresses, this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup (Robin Wright, in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired, stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug, cowardly Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him, and she has been without joy since her true love, a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes), was reportedly murdered on the seas.<br/><br/>Of course, without Wesley, there is no story of true love, and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary, and increasingly hilarious, set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy, Guilder. These three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the Spanish swordsman Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), and the big-hearted slow-witted giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant, in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).<br/><br/>During the kidnapping, however, a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors, and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill, strength, smarts, and of course, deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles, however.<br/><br/>With the exception of Vezzini, the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo, and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik, are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor, sportsmanship, and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).<br/><br/>Inigo, Fezzik, and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead, they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result, when we see them engage in competition, there is not a sense of enmity, but a wonderful air of camaraderie.<br/><br/>Also included in the mix are a sadistic count (Christopher Guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain, an albino (Mel Smith) with a stuffy throat, the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S., and a clergyman (Peter Cook) who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable, perhaps, is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracle-man Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene, Reiner was forced to leave the set, because Crystal&#39;s improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.<br/><br/>Regarding the film&#39;s casting, every single choice, without exception, is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring, ingenious hero, but as an actor, he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy, one that easily coincides with the film&#39;s sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess, endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing British accent, despite her American origins).<br/><br/>For the scene of swordplay, Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months, which is impressive, but on-screen, I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability, wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik, and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course, Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive, perpetually exasperated Vezzini.<br/><br/>We also don&#39;t have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance, callousness, and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity, captivating acts of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film&#39;s most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film&#39;s sole swear word).<br/><br/>For someone who watches this film for the first time, and quickly catches on to the film&#39;s capricious mix of reverence and satire, the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer: any of them will do, as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.<br/><br/>From start to finish, The Princess Bride is a transcendent, magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich, magnificent, and almost nostalgic world of folklore that, after the end credits roll, seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987, it has grown into a cult film of legendary status, and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting), it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come."

I watched it with my parents when I was very young, and have been watching it constantly ever since. It&#39;s a movie that I just can&#39;t seem to grow tired of. For one, I absolutely love the medieval fantasy genre, both in books and movies. From a small child I&#39;ve loved knights, castles, dragons. the whole sort. This movie, quite simply, puts the viewer into an imaginative world where everything seems real. Second, the characters are so enjoyable to watch, you really begin to feel for them - all of them. Even humperdink, whose name does him justice, gets pity at the end. Lastly, the grandfather&#39;s list of the qualities of the book at the very beginning are all true... this story has everything. That is why it is such a classic, when everything comes down to it. From the moving love story between Wesly and Buttercup, to the dynamic and brilliantly scripted duel between the Man in Black and Indigo, to even the hilarious bickering from Vezinni to his lovable giant, Fezzik... This movie finds a place to include EVERYTHING one can imagine.  The story moves along at a great pace, and you feel as though the whole land has been covered when the book is closed. Furthermore, the whole conception of using the &quot;telling a story&quot; approach doesn&#39;t taken away from the realism of the story, but raises it even more by showing how mesmerized the boy is, listening to the tale - just as we are, in front of the screen.<br/><br/>Maybe it was how I was captivated to the screen, watching it as a child... Maybe it was how I&#39;d pop the movie in and turn a boring Sunday afternoon an exciting adventure as I grew up... Or maybe it&#39;s how I can sit down with friends and all enjoy the movie together, laughing at its funny parts, and cheering at it&#39;s exciting moments. The movie has a place in my heart, and that will never go away. A &quot;10&quot; on the scale, and even these words, can&#39;t begin to tell how much I love this movie."

        "text": "I&#39;m not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or, at the very least, I just can&#39;t pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed, it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan (okay, MALE action adventure fan), but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously (at the risk of sounding shallow) girly name, because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel, but the film is truly great from start to finish. And, indeed, the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves, and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage&#39;s initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on, we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can&#39;t get enough. <br/><br/>\nCary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley, the love-struck servant to Buttercup, a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly, Elwes&#39; later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well, especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup, but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief (it was nearly nonstop from start to finish) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini, the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out, Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini&#39;s enormous, idiot sidekick, and by far my favorite of all, Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s (`My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!&#39;).  <br/><br/>This is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book, just like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages. The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed."

        "text": "&quot;Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.&quot;<br/><br/>I know, I picked the most quotable line of this epic fairy tale (sorry for being such a cliché), but it was honestly the scene I enjoyed the most in this movie. Rob Reiner&#39;s The Princess Bride is one of his most revered films and it has become a cult favorite over time. I didn&#39;t fall in love with it however, but I can understand the appeal this romantic fantasy has on so many people considering it has it all: a tale of true love, adventures involving pirates, sword-fights, fantasy creatures, and a princess who is forced to marry against her will. The premise is no different from that of your typical damsel in distress fairy tale, but the way the film seems to be mocking and honoring those familiar elements at the same time are what makes it stand out. It has a unique innocent quality to it while remaining funny, charming, and sweet. Perhaps I would&#39;ve benefited from watching this at a younger age, but having waited so long to experience it for the first time was a bit of an underwhelming experience. I wasn&#39;t swept away by its magical and fantastic elements and the love story didn&#39;t stand out from other romantic tales. There are several fun scenes and unexpected character interactions, but during most of the film I felt a bit bored. The satire works in parts and so does the fantasy, but it just felt too familiar to win me over entirely. <br/><br/>The screenplay was adapted by William Goldman from his own novel of the same name. Although for this film he uses a grandfather (Peter Falk) to narrate the story as he is telling it to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). At first the grandson isn&#39;t too keen about having his grandpa read him a story, especially because it starts off with kissing, but once the adventure begins he&#39;s hooked. There are occasional interruptions that bring us back to the kid&#39;s room, but most of the film takes place in this fantasy land where we are introduced to a very beautiful woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls in love with her farm boy, Westley (Cary Elwes). The two have found true love, but having no money to marry he embarks on a trip and promises to return to her. Buttercup is shattered when she hears that Westley was killed by a fearful pirate named Roberts. With nothing more to look forward to, eventually she gets engaged with Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) of Florin who promises to turn her into a princess. On the eve of her wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two hired henchmen, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) a skilled swordsman who has promised to avenge his father&#39;s death, and the strong but gentle giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant) who really doesn&#39;t know no better. While holding Buttercup ransom and fleeing from the site, they discover that they are being followed by a mysterious man in a black mask. He catches up with them soon and the adventure begins as these men face off with one another and new revelations are made.<br/><br/>Allowing for the story to take place through this narrative style was one of the better decisions because it gave the film its unique dreamy style and it wasn&#39;t necessary to deliver realistic visuals. It was all part of the fantasy, although I would&#39;ve preferred less interruptions, but I guess they had to give Fred Savage and Peter Falk some more lines. The relationship between Elwes and Wright was believable, but it didn&#39;t stand out because it was too familiar. However, they were both the perfect casting choice for these roles. It was Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya who stole the movie for me. I absolutely loved his character and the sword fighting scene was the highlight of the movie for me. It included a brilliant homage to Douglas Fairbanks (which I&#39;m sure gave someone the idea that Elwes would be the perfect choice to spoof his Robin Hood character in a later movie). Montoya was probably the inspiration for Antonio Banderas as well when he was cast to play the Zorro. This character has become an icon and he was the saving grace of the film for me. The rest of the characters were OK, but he stood out. The exception and I think I&#39;m in the minority here was Vizzini. I found Wallace Shawn&#39;s portrayal of him rather irritating and I couldn&#39;t stand him. There is also a hilarious scene with Billy Crystal playing a miracle doctor, who you&#39;d only recognize due to his voice because he is heavily covered in make up to look like an old man. The Princess Bride had its strong moments, but somehow I never managed to fall in love with the fantasy and wouldn&#39;t consider it one of Reiner&#39;s best films. It does prove however what a versatile director he is because the film is very different from his other works. I&#39;m still a bit shocked that the film is so widely loved, but I can&#39;t argue it isn&#39;t a good movie. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

But it&#39;s in the IMDb &#39;Top 250&#39;, so as I manage my viewing to go through that list, this one came up in it&#39;s proper turn. I&#39;d have to say this one was more than a surprise. It was fairly entertaining and I don&#39;t mind saying it had the very best sword fight I&#39;ve ever seen in any movie, which is saying something because I&#39;ve seen Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks in action, and I don&#39;t think any of them could have held their own with either Dread Pirate Roberts/Farm Boy Westley (Cary Elwes) or Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). Now there could have been some special effects involved there, but if so, it wasn&#39;t transparent. Those two put on quite a show.<br/><br/>The story also had a few pretty cool concepts like the shrieking eels and the Cliffs of Insanity. The Fire Swamp and the Lightning Sand were kind of original too. The convoluted turn of phrase that old Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) engaged in trying to outwit the Dread Pirate was pretty amusing, and if you try to keep up with it you&#39;ll be hopelessly lost, so best not even to try. It was also neat to see Andre the Giant in the film, one of the wrestling world&#39;s all time favorites. Interesting, but when he spoke he sounded kind of normal, unlike his in-character TV interviews where he had a much more guttural and heavily accented voice.<br/><br/>With all that going on, it&#39;s easy to forget that the Princess Bride tale is a story within a story, as a grandfather (Peter Falk) attempts to carry on a long family tradition of reading a favorite book to his grandson (Fred Savage). It doesn&#39;t sound very favorable at the outset with the romance and the &#39;eeeuw&#39; kissing, but the kid warms up to the story when it sounds like there will be some action and adventure. If I had to come up with a minor nit-pick, it seemed like the picture got a bit more slapstick in the final third of the movie. Otherwise the humor was well placed and I thought it made for fine family fare."

      "plot_summary": "An elderly grandfather (the Grandfather) reads the book The Princess Bride to his sick grandson in their home. The book's story follows Buttercup, a farm girl in the kingdom of Florin, who loved her farmhand Westley; his stock phrase “as you wish” revealed his love. Westley leaves to seek fortune; Buttercup learns his ship was taken by the Dread Pirate Roberts and believes Westley dead. Buttercup is engaged to Prince Humperdinck of Florin but, while riding to clear her head, is kidnapped by a trio: Vizzini (a Sicilian strategist), Inigo Montoya (a skilled Spanish swordsman), and Fezzik (a huge strongman). They carry her by boat up the Cliffs of Insanity. A mysterious masked Man in Black pursues them, defeats Inigo in a courteous sword duel, knocks out Fezzik by choking him, and outwits Vizzini in a poisoned-wine battle of wits, killing Vizzini. The Man in Black reveals himself to Buttercup as the Dread Pirate Roberts; she pushes him off a cliff in fury, but he tumbles and says “as you wish,” revealing he is Westley. Westley explains he became Roberts’ successor rather than being killed. He and Buttercup flee toward the Fire Swamp; they survive R.O.U.S. (rodents of unusual size), lightning sand, and flame spurts, but are captured by Prince Humperdinck, who had arranged the kidnapping to manufacture a casus belli against the neighboring country Guilder. Humperdinck offers to free Westley if Buttercup will marry him; she agrees to save Westley, believing Westley will return for her. Instead, Humperdinck betrays Westley and hands him to his sadistic right-hand, Count Tyrone Rugen (the six-fingered man). Rugen tortures Westley in a subterranean Pit of Despair using a device called the Machine, leaving Westley seemingly dead. Meanwhile, Inigo, who has pursued the six-fingered man for twenty years to avenge his father Diego Montoya (whose killer was the six-fingered Count), and Fezzik — now working in Florin’s brute squad — learn Rugen is in the castle. Fezzik finds an inebriated Inigo in the Thieves' Forest; they reunite and agree they need the Man in Black’s planning. Inigo and Fezzik discover Westley’s body being hauled away by the albino. They take Westley to Miracle Max, a disgraced miracle-worker, who at first refuses but then, pressed by Valerie (Max’s wife) and the trio’s purpose (to ruin Humperdinck), makes a pill that brings Westley back — mostly dead but able to speak. Westley, Inigo and Fezzik plan a desperate assault on the castle during Buttercup’s wedding to Humperdinck. Disguised as the Dread Pirate Roberts (Fezzik in a dark cloak in a wheelbarrow, Inigo pushing, and Westley pale and nearly immobile), they bluff the castle guards, set the cloak on fire to cause panic, and gain entry. Inigo hunts Rugen through castle corridors; they fight in a banquet hall where Rugen wounds Inigo multiple times but Inigo ultimately kills Rugen after repeating his challenge: “Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.” Westley, feigning death earlier, frees himself and confronts Prince Humperdinck in the honeymoon suite. Humperdinck attempts to reassert control; Westley forces him to submit verbally and threatens to disfigure him rather than kill him. Buttercup, preparing to commit suicide rather than live married to Humperdinck, is reunited with Westley; she learns the wedding was rushed and not legal. Fezzik finds four white horses; the four (Westley, Buttercup, Inigo, Fezzik) escape on horseback. Back in the frame story, the grandson demands to hear the ending; the Grandfather reads the final romantic line and promises to return the next day, ending with “as you wish.”",

      "fairy tale story-within-a-story with an all-star cast. in the frame story, a grandfather ( peter falk ) reads a favorite book to his sick grandson ( fred savage ). the book he reads, the princess bride by s. morgenstern, is about the most beautiful woman in the world, the hero who loves her, and the evil prince who says he wants to marry her. the lovely buttercup ( robin wright ) is kidnapped on the eve of her wedding to prince humperdinck ( chris sarandon ) of florin. (buttercup isn't in love with humperdinck; long ago she gave her heart to westley ( cary elwes ), a farmhand. but she's given westley up for dead because his ship was captured by the notorious take-no-prisoners dread pirate roberts and she's heard nothing for years, so she might as well marry humperdinck.) the kidnappers carry her off in a boat and up the cliffs of insanity, pursued by a mysterious masked man in black. at the top of the cliffs, vizzini the sicilian ( wallace shawn ), the chief bad guy, leaves his henchman inigo montoya ( mandy patinkin ) to deal with the man in black. inigo is a superb swordsman, but in a spectacular cliff-top duel after a most gentlemanly accommodating chat, the man in black proves to be better. sparing inigo's life, he goes off in pursuit of buttercup and her captors. the huge and immensely strong fezzik ( andré rené roussimoff ), vizzini's remaining henchman, tries to overpower him, but the man in black manages to choke fezzik until he loses consciousness. when he catches up with vizzini and his captive, the man in black challenges the sicilian to a battle of wits in which one of them is sure to die. he has a packet of highly poisonous iocaine powder and two goblets of wine. out of vizzini's sight, he adds iocaine to one of the goblets. he places one goblet in front of vizzini and one in front of himself. vizzini must choose whether to drink from the goblet given to him or the one the man in black kept for himself; the man in black will drink from the remaining goblet. after a fevered application of logic, vizzini chooses, drinks, and dies -- the man in black, who has spent years developing a tolerance of iocaine, has poisoned both goblets. the man in black tells buttercup he's the dread pirate roberts and he's taking her to his ship. buttercup, infuriated that the man who killed westley has come after her, pushes him down a mountainside. as he tumbles down the steep incline, he says \"as you wish...\" -- which westley used to say to buttercup. realizing that the man in black is westley, buttercup goes down after him and learns his story: rather than killing him, the dread pirate roberts took westley on as his apprentice. he taught westley everything he knew, then retired, bestowing his ship and his name on westley. westley didn't reveal himself to buttercup at first because he didn't think she still loved him. meanwhile, prince humperdinck -- who of course arranged the kidnapping -- has raised the alarm and given chase. he wants an excuse to go to war with guilder, the neighboring country toward which buttercup's captors were carrying her. westley and buttercup flee into the fearsome fire swamp to escape their pursuers. the fire swamp offers no end of excitement: hungry rouses (rodents of unusual size), lightning sand (quicksand on steroids), and unpredictable jets of flame shooting out of the ground -- but westley gets them through it. alas, it's all for nothing; they're captured by prince humperdinck and his men as soon as they emerge from the swamp. so buttercup makes a deal; she'll go back and marry humperdinck in exchange for westley's freedom. humperdinck has no intention of holding up his end of the bargain and turns westley over to his friend and lieutenant, count rugen ( christopher guest ), as soon as buttercup is out of earshot. count rugen is a cruel and arrogant man whose history is tied to inigo montoya's. twenty years before, the count visited inigo's father diego montoya, a famously skilled swordsmith, and commissioned a sword of the highest quality. the job was challenging because count rugen (who did not give his name) has six fingers on his right hand. when the count came to collect his new weapon, which was the best diego montoya had ever made, rugen would pay only a fraction of the agreed-upon cost. when montoya objected, count rugen killed him. inigo challenged his father's killer to a duel, but he was only 11; the count bested him easily, left him with a scar on each cheek, and rode off -- without his new sword. the grief-stricken boy vowed to avenge his father and spent the next twenty years studying swordsmanship and searching for the six-fingered man. he kept the sword. count rugen has made a long study of pain and has built the machine, a suction-cup-based instrument of torture which he believes can inflict the most intense pain a human being can experience. he keeps the machine in a secret chamber beneath the castle grounds called the pit of despair, and it is here that westley is taken. humperdinck, with buttercup in tow, goes home to prepare for his wedding and for the invasion of guilder, for which he plans to get popular support in florin by murdering buttercup on their wedding night and blaming guilder. buttercup shortly realizes that her love for westley is so strong that she can't bring herself to marry humperdinck. she asks to be released from her promise on the grounds that she'll kill herself on her wedding night if forced to go through with it. humperdinck pretends to give in. he suggests that westley might no longer love buttercup, but he promises to send his four fastest ships in pursuit of the fugitive, carrying copies of a letter from buttercup asking westley to come back for her. he asks that if westley doesn't come back, she consider marrying him, humperdinck, as an alternative to suicide. buttercup, serenely confident that her westley will save her, agrees. in the days leading up the wedding, prince humperdinck makes a great show of beefing up security around the castle. he orders florin's thieves' forest cleared of potential troublemakers and the guard at the castle gate increased. fezzik is hired into the brute squad assigned to purge the thieves' forest and learns that count rugen -- inigo's long-sought six-fingered man -- is in the castle. when he finds a very inebriated inigo in the thieves' forest, fezzik takes him home, sobers him up, and tells him that he's found the six-fingered man. inigo and fezzik resolve to go after count rugen, but realize they need someone who's good at planning -- someone like the man in black. meanwhile in the pit of despair, count rugen has used the machine (on a low setting) to suck away a year of westley's life. when buttercup realizes that prince humperdinck never sent those ships to search for westley, she calls him a coward. he takes out his anger by running down to the pit, cranking the machine all the way up, and torturing westley to death. (buttercup still has no idea that humperdinck has westley.) fezzik and inigo hear westley's dying scream and come looking for him. near the pit they meet the albino ( mel smith ), who has brought a wheelbarrow to haul away westley's body. fezzik knocks him out by mistake before he can tell them where westley is, so inigo has to call on his father's spirit to guide him to the pit's hidden entrance (which is in a tree trunk). they reach the pit of despair to find that westley is dead and they need a miracle. cut to the frame story. the grandson is upset: how can westley be dead? who gets prince humperdinck in the end? nobody, says the grandfather -- humperdinck lives. the grandson becomes more upset, and the grandfather suggests that they stop reading the book for now. the grandson settles down and begs his grandfather to continue. inigo and fezzik take westley's body to miracle max ( billy crystal ), who is retired (having been fired by humperdinck) and doesn't want to take the job. he threatens to call the brute squad to run them off, but gives in when fezzik points out that he's on the the brute squad. max diagnoses westley as being mostly dead and (using bellows to give him the breath to answer) asks westley what in his life is worth coming back from the dead for; westley answers \"true love.\" max pretends to misunderstand, but his wife valerie ( carol kane ) badgers him to help and mentions that max lost his confidence when prince humperdinck gave him the sack. inigo says that westley is buttercup's true love, and if max can bring him back to life, it will ruin humperdinck's wedding. delighted at the prospect of doing the prince a bad turn, max accepts their money and whips up a large, chocolate-coated miracle pill. inigo and fezzik go off with westley and the pill, accompanied by max and valerie's good wishes. \"have fun storming the castle!\" on a rampart overlooking the castle gate, inigo and fezzik feed the miracle pill to westley's corpse. it works immediately -- at least, it brings him mostly back to life; he can talk, but he can't walk or move much. the three review the situation: the castle gate is guarded by 60 men and buttercup is due to be married in less than half an hour. they need to get in, rescue buttercup, and kill count rugen. their assets: inigo's sword, fezzik's strength, and westley's brains. westley objects that with so little time to plan, it can't be done -- though if they had a wheelbarrow, that might help. inigo and fezzik recall that the albino's wheelbarrow is handy, and when westley says \"what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak,\" fezzik produces one that max gave him because \"it fit so nice.\" in the castle chapel, the wedding is ready to begin. outside, a dark apparition (fezzik wearing the holocaust cloak and standing in the wheelbarrow, pushed with difficulty by inigo, who is also dragging the nearly-immobile westley) approaches the gate. \"i am the dread pirate roberts,\" the apparition booms. \"there will be no survivors!\" the guards at the gate waver. when inigo sets the holocaust cloak on fire, the guards flee, except for yellin ( malcolm storry ), humperdinck's chief enforcer. yellin gives up the gate key when they threaten to have fezzik rip his arms off. inigo, fezzik and westley encounter count rugen and some guards in a castle corridor. rugen sics the guards on inigo and fezzik, but inigo dispatches them easily. then he addresses count rugen: \"my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.\" count rugen extends his sword, thinks better of it, and runs away. humperdinck (who heard the commotion at the gate and sent rugen to investigate) has rushed the silly-voiced clergyman ( peter cook ) straight past the \"i do's\" to \"man and wife,\" and a bewildered buttercup (who was sure westley would save her before she was married) is escorted to the honeymoon suite by the king ( willoughby gray ) and queen ( anne dyson ), her new in-laws. buttercup thanks the king for his kindness and tells him she'll be killing herself shortly; the king (who's rather deaf and probably gaga) replies \"won't that be nice!\" inigo takes off after rugen but quickly runs into a locked door and calls for fezzik. fezzik drapes the rubbery-legged westley over a suit of armor and goes off to help. he's puzzled when he comes back a few minutes later and westley is gone. meanwhile, though, inigo has chased the count through the castle. brought to bay in a banquet hall, rugen pulls a dagger from his boot and throws it at inigo, hitting him in the stomach. inigo seems on the verge of expiring, and the count is able to wound him in both shoulders. then inigo pulls himself together and returns to the fight reciting his challenge, his voice and his attack strengthening with every repetition: \"hello, my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die!\" \"stop saying that,\" the unnerved count whines just before inigo closes in. after inflicting wounds on rugen's cheeks and shoulders that match the wounds rugen inflicted on him, inigo allows the count to bargain and beg for his life, then kills him with a thrust to the gut. in the honeymoon suite, buttercup takes up a dagger. as she prepares to kill herself, a voice behind her says \"there's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. it would be a pity to damage yours.\" she turns to find westley reclining on the bed and throws herself into his arms. after a moment of blissful reunion, buttercup confesses that without meaning to, she's married prince humperdinck. westley points out that if she didn't say \"i do\" (which she didn't because humperdinck made the clergyman skip most of the ceremony), it wasn't a legal wedding. humperdinck enters, declaring that he will remedy the technicality. but first, he wants to challenge westley to a battle to the death. westley counters, \"no! to the pain!\" he describes how he will disfigure the handsome prince, leaving him his ears so every shriek and cry uttered by people who see him will echo in his perfect ears. westley stands and tells humperdinck to drop his sword. cowed, humperdinck does, and then he sits in a chair as buttercup ties him to it. inigo stumbles in and offers to kill prince humperdinck, but westley wants him to live alone with his cowardice. they hear fezzik calling for inigo from the courtyard. fezzik has found four white horses, and since there are four of them, he brought them out with him. buttercup jumps down and fezzik catches her. inigo isn't sure what he'll do with the rest of his life. westley asks if he's considered piracy: \"you'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts.\" they jump down and all four ride away on the whites. the grandfather is finishing the story. before reading the last line, he closes the book, because it's more kissing. (the grandson doesn't like the kissy parts.) but the grandson says that he doesn't mind so much, so the grandfather reads the last line of the book: \"since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses rated the most passionate, the most pure. this one left them all behind.\" the grandfather tells the boy to go to sleep, and the grandson asks him to return the next day and read the book again. the grandfather replies, \"as you wish.\""

      "an elderly man reads the book \"the princess bride\" to his sick and thus currently bedridden adolescent grandson, the reading of the book which has been passed down within the family for generations. the grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he prefers something with lots of action and \"no kissing\", but he lets grandfather continue, because he doesn't want to hurt his feelings. the story centers on buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to prince humperdinck of florin. buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, westley, five years ago. westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of \"as you wish\" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. but westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the dread pirate roberts. on a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named fezzik who works on his brawn, and a spaniard named inigo montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. they in turn are chased by the dread pirate roberts himself. but chasing them all is the prince, and his men led by count tyrone rugen. what happens to these collectives is dependent partly on buttercup, who does not want to marry the prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. but a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.",

The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema.

        "text": "Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family&#39;s ban on music. <br/><br/>In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos. <br/><br/>Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it&#39;s beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel. <br/><br/>Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I&#39;m not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn&#39;t paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes. <br/><br/>In high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly. <br/><br/>It&#39;s not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It&#39;s about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!"

Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn&#39;t work that well. Then came Pixar with it&#39;s revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.<br/><br/>Though the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven&#39;t felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.<br/><br/>Coco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don&#39;t think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it&#39;s definitely up there among Pixar&#39;s finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll like it and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hug &#39;em all as soon as the credits roll."

So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.<br/><br/>We were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)<br/><br/>It surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. &quot;there will be no X in this family!&quot; X being &quot;instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past&quot;. Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we&#39;re at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?<br/><br/>Did I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them &quot;mama, I miss you.&quot;<br/><br/>Beautiful."

He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!<br/><br/>The story here is very artificially structured, with all sorts of bits and pieces present s that a predetermined trail of events can be created. But you never notice that, so natural is the narrative flow. <br/><br/>This film is highly original, full of truly gorgeous visuals, lovely songs, delightful characters, and touching resolutions to several individual story threads.

      "plot_summary": "In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, matriarch Imelda Rivera banned music after her husband (a musician) abandoned her and their infant daughter Coco; the family became shoemakers and maintained an ofrenda with ancestor photos. Ninety-six years later, 12-year-old Miguel Rivera secretly teaches himself guitar and idolizes film star musician Ernesto de la Cruz. On Día de los Muertos Miguel's abuelita destroys his homemade guitar; Miguel finds a torn photograph hidden behind a frame that shows a man holding Ernesto's famous guitar and assumes Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather. Miguel steals Ernesto's guitar from Ernesto's tomb in the municipal cemetery to enter a talent contest. When he strums it he becomes invisible to the living and is pulled into the Land of the Dead, a vast, colorful city accessed by a marigold-bridge. There the Riveras discover Imelda's photo is missing from the family's ofrenda in the living world, so Imelda cannot cross over. Miguel is told he has been cursed for stealing from the dead: he will become dead if he does not receive a blessing from a living family member using an aztec marigold petal before sunrise. Imelda offers a conditional blessing if Miguel renounces music; he accepts and returns to the living, then immediately steals Ernesto's guitar again and is transported back to the Land of the Dead. Miguel meets Hector, a scrappy skeleton who claims to have been a songwriter and Ernest o's former partner; Hector offers to help Miguel find Ernesto in exchange for Miguel returning Hector's photo to the living world so Hector's daughter will remember him. Hector guides Miguel to Ernesto's mansion. There Miguel learns—through Hector's accusations and later evidence—that Ernesto and Hector were once a duo, but Ernesto grew envious, poisoned Hector to keep him from leaving, stole Hector's songs and guitar, and passed them off as his own. Ernesto appears and welcomes Miguel as kin, then betrays them: Ernesto seizes Hector's photo and has Miguel and Hector thrown into a cenote. In the cenote Hector reveals he is Miguel's real great-great-grandfather and that his daughter is Coco; Coco (alive, elderly and increasingly forgetful) still remembers him. Dante, Miguel's stray dog who becomes an alebrije (spirit guide) in the Land of the Dead, helps rescue them. The dead Rivera family locates and infiltrates Ernesto's sunrise concert to recover Hector's photo and expose Ernesto. In the resulting confrontation, Ernesto is crushed by a falling bell just as in his recorded death, and Hector's photo is recovered but is damaged when it falls into water. As dawn approaches Hector begins to fade because Coco may forget him; Imelda, seeing Hector's truth and moved by reconciliation, gives Miguel an unconditional blessing using a marigold petal so he can return to the living. Miguel returns home, apologizes, and plays Hector's song \"Remember Me\" on the guitar; Coco sings and recounts her father's story, restoring Hector's memory. Miguel reunites with his family; the ban on music is lifted. One year later the family ofrenda includes Hector and the recently deceased Coco; letters prove Ernesto stole Hector's work and Ernesto's reputation is ruined in the living world while Hector receives posthumous recognition. In the Land of the Dead, Hector rejoins Imelda, Coco and the Rivera family, and Miguel performs for both worlds.",

      "in santa cecilia, mexico, family matriarch imelda rivera (alanna ubach) was the wife of a musician. imelda's husband left imelda and her daughter, coco (ana ofelia murguía), to pursue a career in music. imelda banned music in the family and turned to shoe-making, which became the family business as each of the next generation was taught to make shoes by imelda and then by coco. 96 years later, her great-great-grandson, 12-year-old miguel (anthony gonzalez) now lives with the elderly coco and their family in a small mexican village. coco is miguel's great-grandmother, her daughters abuelita (renee victor) & late tia victoria (dyana ortelli) are miguel's grand-mothers, papa julio (alfonso arau) is coco's late husband, tia rosita (selene luna) is coco's late sister-in-law, tios oscar and felipe (herbert siguenza) are miguel's late uncles. the photographs of the deceased ancestors are preserved on the family ofrenda. papa (jaime camil) is abuelita's son & miguel's father, & mama (sofia espinosa) is his mother. tio berto (luis valdez) is papa's brother, and gloria (carla medina) is papa's sister. berto is married to carmen, and they have a son abel (polo rojas) and daughter rosa (montse hernandez). despite the family's continued ban on music, miguel secretly loves it and teaches himself to play guitar by watching videos of his idol, the late musician ernesto.\nhe secretly dreams of becoming a musician like ernesto de la cruz (benjamin bratt), a popular film/singing star of imelda's generation. ernesto made people fall in love with him and he had the coolest guitar, with which he sang the best songs including miguel's favorite \"remember me\". ernesto died in 1942 during a stage performance, when a heavy bell hung on stage accidentally fell right on top of him. miguel was giving a shoeshine to a mariachi while telling him his life's story. the mariachi encourages miguel to enter the talent show on day of the dead to honor the legacy of ernesto. but this is when abuelita arrives and chases away the mariachi. day of the dead is like a family reunion day except that the dead ancestors are the guests of honor. as per local folklore, only those ancestors are able to cross over who are remembered in some shape or form by the living relatives. this is why families put their ancestors' photos on the ofrenda.\ncoco is now old and senile, and she still asks imelda if her papa is coming home on the day of the dead. miguel has a secret ofrenda he has created for ernesto and even made a guitar himself. on the day of the dead, miguel inadvertently bumps the family ofrenda and breaks a frame containing a photo of imelda and an infant coco. he discovers a hidden section of the photograph that shows his great-great-grandfather (whose head has been torn from the photo) holding ernesto's famous guitar. miguel believes that this conclusively proves that ernesto is his ancestor. later, when miguel attempts to enter a talent show for the day of the dead, his grandmother abuelita destroys his guitar. miguel argues that he is supposed to be a musician, but his family is adamant that the man abandoned his family and the man's music was a curse. miguel runs away saying that he wants no part of his family. miguel goes to play in the town plaza, but he had no instrument, and nobody would lend him a guitar. miguel comes across ernesto's statue in the plaza, holding a guitar. he reckons that ernesto would have been buried with his beloved guitar. concluding that he is ernesto's great-great-grandson, miguel enters his tomb and steals his guitar to use in the show. when he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza but can see and be seen by his xoloitzcuintli dog dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the land of the dead for the holiday. miguel's dead relatives take him to the land of the dead (by crossing a large bridge made of flowers) and miguel is astounded that the land of the dead is a like a vast city, grown over centuries. at the end of the bridge are cross over officials who match the ancestors with their photos in their family's ofrenda. only is the photo being there, are the ancestors allowed to cross over. if anyone tries to cross over by force, the flower bridge traps them. they find that imelda is unable to cross over as her photo has been removed from the ofrenda. miguel also discovers that he has been cursed for stealing from the dead. miguel must return to the land of the living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead. to do so, he must receive a blessing from his family that can undo the curse placed upon him by stealing ernesto's guitar, using an aztec marigold petal. imelda offers miguel a blessing on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits. miguel accepts and lands right back at ernesto's tomb. but then miguel steals the guitar again to play at the plaza and lands right back in the land of the dead.\nmiguel refuses to accept imelda's condition and attempts to seek ernesto's blessing (as he believes that ernesto was the one married to imelda). miguel encounters hector (gael garcia bernal), a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played with ernesto and offers to help miguel reach him. in return, hector asks miguel to take his photo back to the land of the living so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him, which would cause him to fade from existence. hector attempts to return miguel to his relatives, but miguel escapes. miguel sneaks into ernesto's mansion and is welcomed by a surprised ernesto. ernesto welcomes miguel as his descendant, but hector confronts them, imploring miguel to take his photo. hector accuses ernesto of stealing his songs. as the two argue, miguel slowly pieces together the truth: ernesto and héctor were once a musical act on the brink of fame until hector grew homesick and tried to leave. unable to write songs himself, ernesto poisoned héctor and stole his guitar and songs to pass off as his own.\nernesto steals hector's photo and has him and miguel thrown into a cenote pit. there, hector reveals that his daughter is named coco, thus making him miguel's actual great-great-grandfather. coco is the only living person who still remembers him. with the help of dante - who now appears as an alebrije - the dead riveras find and rescue them. miguel explains that hector's death was the result of his decision to return home to her and coco, and imelda and hector reconcile. they infiltrate ernesto's sunrise concert to retrieve hector's photo from ernesto and reveal him as a fraud to the crowd. ernesto is crushed by a falling bell, just as he was in life, but the photo is destroyed once it reaches the water. as the sun rises, hector is in danger of being forgotten and disappearing. imelda blesses miguel without conditions so he can return to the land of the living. back home, miguel apologizes to his family for running away and plays \"remember me\" on hector's guitar, brightening coco to sing with him. she shares that she kept the torn piece of the photo with hector's face, then tells her family stories about her father, preserving his memory and existence in the land of the dead. miguel reconciles with his family and the ban on music is finally lifted. one year later, miguel shows his new baby sister, socorro, the family ofrenda, now displaying photos of hector and the recently deceased coco. coco's collected letters from hector prove ernesto's theft of his songs, leading to ernesto's disgrace and hector's rightful recognition. in the land of the dead, hector joins imelda, coco, and their family to visit the living world. miguel performs a heartfelt song for his living and dead relatives."

The Bishop&#39;s Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don&#39;t have the same magic.\nThis year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It&#39;s a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.<br/><br/>The story is about this lazy and clumpsy guy, Jesper, who is the only son of the director of a Mail School. His father wants to teach him a lesson and sends him to this little snowy place called Smeerensburg. Only if he succeeds in delivering 6000 letters in a year he&#39;s allowed to come back and continue his luxery life.\nOf course Jesper obeys: he doesn&#39;t have a choice. But when he arrives at Smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is an almost imposible one. Two rival families are at constant war with each other and will never send each other letters. But when Jesper visits his last hope, this hermit called Klaus, something magical happens. By accident this mourning figure receives a letter from a child and wants to return this nice gesture by giving the boy a present. Suddenly all the childeren of the village want to send letters...<br/><br/>Why does Santa always say &quot;Ho! Ho! Ho!?&quot;. How did he get his reindeers? Does he really have a naughty book? Why does he travel on a sleigh? All those questions will be answered in this great tale of one man, Jesper, changing the fate of a town that once only knew anger and never friendship. The end of Klaus is actually quite moving.<br/><br/>Forget The Polar Express or all the Christmas Carols. Klaus is the real deal! Go see it on Netflix!<br/><br/>9/10"

      "plot_summary": "Jesper Johansen, the spoiled, lazy son of the Royal Postmaster General, deliberately performs poorly at the postal academy. To force him to become responsible, his father ships him to the frozen island town of Smeerensburg with one year to post 6,000 letters or be cut off from the family. Jesper arrives to find a fogbound, hostile village dominated by two feuding families, the Ellingboes and the Krums; the post office is dilapidated and no one writes letters. The ferryman Mogens explains the town's coldness; teacher Alva (who now sells fish) tells Jesper the children don't attend school. Jesper initially plans to leave but, desperate for letters, studies an old map and locates a remote house belonging to a giant, reclusive toymaker named Klaus Klausson. When Jesper first meets Klaus, he is frightened by Klaus's size and solitary ways and flees, leaving behind a child's drawing of a home life. Klaus forces Jesper to deliver a toy from his house to the boy in the drawing; the boy's joy sparks other children to bring letters asking Klaus for toys. Jesper returns to Klaus and proposes a partnership: the toymaker will give toys and accompany Jesper on night deliveries; Klaus agrees if Jesper brings letters at night. Word spreads and more children learn to write so they can send letters; Alva reopens her school after using her savings to move back into teaching. Jesper invents a story that Klaus only gives toys to good children — a lie that motivates better behavior among the kids and, gradually, the adults. The Krums and Ellingboes begin to thaw when a Krums boy and an Ellingboes girl play together after receiving a toy, enraging their parents. Klaus reveals to Jesper that he and his late wife Lydia made toys for children they never had; seeing the community's joy, Klaus begins to make more toys. When the toy supply dwindles, Jesper, pushed by a Sami girl named Márgu who cannot speak Norwegian, persuades Klaus to help build a sled; Klaus resists at first but reconciles with Jesper and finishes the sled with him. The townspeople's generosity spreads; Jesper grows close to Alva and contemplates staying. The feuding family heads, Mr. Ellingboe and Mrs. Krum, resent the new goodwill and conspire to sabotage Jesper and Klaus. They manipulate Jesper's father into believing Jesper has posted 14,000 letters, prompting the postmaster general to visit Smeerensburg on Christmas Eve. The families plan to destroy Klaus's toys to rekindle the feud; during their attack Magda Ellingboe and Olaf Krum (their brawny children) fall in love in the chaos. Jesper tries to stop the destruction but appears to fail; Alva and Klaus, forewarned by the children, had already swapped real toys for wooden decoys in Klaus's sled. Jesper redeems himself through his efforts, and Klaus and Alva help deliver the real presents to the town. The public reveal of the children's letter-writing and the marriage between Magda and Olaf force the Ellingboes and Krums to end the feud. Jesper stays in Smeerensburg with his new purpose; he and Klaus continue delivering toys each Christmas and expand the tradition beyond the island for eleven years. Klaus gradually withdraws and then mysteriously disappears on the twelfth year; Jesper marries Alva, they raise two children, and Jesper continues to deliver gifts every Christmas Eve, waiting for Klaus's return as the town keeps the legend alive.",

      "jesper (jason schwartzman) is the lazy and unambitious son of a postmaster general, who deliberately under-performs at his father's postal academy. jesper does not take the academy seriously and even undermines the authority of the drill sergeant (j. k. simmons) the assistant head of the johansen family's postal department who works under the royal postmaster general.\njesper had spent 9 months at the academy and learned nothing at all. jesper was not good at sorting / filing, carrier pigeon handling, transport of fragile merchandise, among other things. in a final effort to get his son to change his behavior, his father sends him to the distant island town of smeerensburg with the task of posting 6,000 letters in a year, and if he fails, he will be cut off from the family estate. that would be the end of jesper's privileged life, and he would end up in the gutter.\njesper travels by coach to the end of the mainland and the only way to get to smeerensburg is to take a ferry. the island is surrounded in fog, and it is miserably cold. once there, it becomes clear, as explained to jesper by the sarcastic, mischievous ferryman mogens (norm macdonald) and bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger alva (rashida jones), that the town's perpetually warring families, the ellingboes and the krums, and who comprise nearly all of the population, hardly exchange words, let alone letters. few months go by, without any letters at all.\nthe 2 families are in a constant state of war with each other and even the children are caught up in the frenzy and contribute to the animosity. alva resorted to selling fish as people didn't send their kids to school in town. now she is saving money to escape. the post office is a dilapidated structure, which is completely rotten and exposed to the elements, and jesper has a tough first night sleeping in the bitter cold with high winds. desperate to figure out a way to post letters from the town, jesper notices on the map in his office a far-off little establishment. there, he discovers a reclusive woodsman named klaus (j.k. simmons), with a house filled with handmade toys. terrified by the man's size and appearance, jesper flees, and leaves behind a drawing made by one of smeerensburg's children about his own home life. jesper prepares to escape the town when klaus comes to him, demanding to go to the house depicted in the drawing. there, klaus forces jesper to deliver a package to the boy inside-a toy. word of this event spreads to other children, who go to jesper the next day, thinking that, by sending letters to klaus, he will deliver a toy to them. jesper capitalizes on the idea and goes to klaus with the proposal of donating the toys in his house, to which klaus agrees provided the toys will be delivered at night so he can accompany jesper. news of the deeds quickly spreads, and more and more town children begin writing letters to klaus. the krum boy's toy leads him to play with an ellingboe girl, much to their clans' outrage. as more children write letters to klaus, jesper tells a boy who had earlier ridiculed him that klaus knows whenever any child misbehaves and only gives toys to good children. jesper says that klaus always knows when any child misbehaves, the acts of kindness they subsequently perform gradually inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their dispute. the children ask bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger alva to teach them to read and write so they can send letters. with her faith restored, alva uses her escape savings to reopen her school. eventually, jesper and klaus begin running out of toys to give to the children, and jesper suggests they make more in time for christmas. klaus initially refuses, but jasper happens upon a keepsake of klaus's late wife lydia, klaus forces him away.\nmotivated by márgu, a sami girl who can't write or speak in norwegian, jesper works with alva to help márgu write a letter asking for a sled, which he then attempts to build alone. seeing jesper's effort, klaus reconciles with him and the two finish the sled. while making the sled for the sami girl margu (neda margrethe labba) in a neighboring settlement, klaus tells jesper about his wife, lydia. he explains he made the toys to give to the future children that the couple never had, especially due to lydia's early passing. klaus realizes their work has been spreading joy to the children, and comes around to the christmas plan. márgu arrives with the rest of her people to help. as the town and jesper's relationship with alva flourish, jesper finds himself conflicted about whether to leave smeerensburg. meanwhile, family leaders mr. ellingboe (will sasso) and mrs. krum (joan cusack) form a temporary truce in order to stop jesper and klaus so that they can have the families resume their traditional feud. they eventually trick jesper's father into believing jesper had posted 14,000 letters. jesper's father arrives on christmas eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing the true reason he did everything he had since coming to smeerensburg to everyone. just before they leave town, jesper's father notices his son's remorse; after a private talk, he allows jesper to stay. when the 2 families heads go to destroy the christmas toys, jesper does everything he can to stop them and apparently fails, however, over the course of the resulting chase, mr. ellingboe's brutish daughter magdalone (sergio pablos) and mrs. krum's oafish son olaf (also pablos) fall in love, and thanks to alva having been informed by the children about their parents' plot, she and klaus had already replaced the toys in klaus' sleigh with wooden decoys. jesper's actions have redeemed him to klaus and alva, and they then deliver the christmas presents to the town. with jesper now redeemed, smeerensburg becomes a kind and happy town, with mr. ellingboe and mrs. krum being forced to end the families' feud due to the marriage of their children. jesper and klaus continue to deliver presents in smeerensburg and beyond for the next ten years. the year after that, klaus disappears, seemingly going to join his departed wife. jesper marries alva and they raise two children. he and klaus continue to deliver presents in smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. on the twelfth year, klaus mysteriously disappears. every subsequent christmas eve, jesper waits for klaus, who returns every year to deliver toys across the world."

      "postal worker jesper is sent to a remote, feuding town where he meets reclusive toymaker klaus. together, they inspire acts of generosity, kindness, and community, gradually transforming the town's culture. the film blends humor, heart, and inventive animation to explore friendship, redemption, and the origin of the santa claus myth. themes of empathy, hope, and the transformative power of goodwill underscore the story, making it a family-oriented tale of moral awakening."

Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who&#39;s trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.<br/><br/>The first part of this movie is a real tear jerker. When Carl and Ellie&#39;s lives flash through the years, all the heart breaks and all the love just jump off the screen. Then there is comedy as the journey to Paradise Falls starts. The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar."

Forced to leave his home, threatened by real-estate interests, to live in a nursing home where he didn&#39;t want to go, Carl decides to go on a long journey that always wanted to do with his wife but that life never allowed... and departs with your home through a system that he created and that makes it fly. But the journey is bound to change radically when he meets the scout Russell, eight-year-old, grabbed on his porch, an unwitting passenger on that trip.<br/><br/>Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two brilliant directors of Pixar Animation Studio behind hits like &quot;Wall-e&quot;, &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; or &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, this film has a number of experienced voices and a touching soundtrack, which earned the Academy Award that year for Best Original Score. A curious fact: the place represented as a destination point for Carl&#39;s trip - the fictional Paradise Falls - exists on the real life, in the border between Venezuela and Brazil: its Mount Roraima.<br/><br/>The most touching on this film is to see the love of Carl and Ellie, alive even after her death and visible in the way he keeps her memory alive and ever present. Russell&#39;s goodness also move us, especially when he is confronted with the harsh ways of stubborn Carl, who sees in Russell a problem. Another deeply moving character is Dough, a friendly and affectionate dog who speaks through a device placed on his leash.<br/><br/>For all these things, &quot;Up&quot; is a film for the whole family, is a film that touches us, moves us and thrills. It proves that, if love cannot move mountains can still move homes, and that no one is too old to live an adventure or fulfill a dream."

        "text": "What&#39;s up? Up is up! It was very successful movie! It even was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. It was the second animation film to do that. Directed by Pete Docter, Up is Pixar&#39;s tenth film in their series and their first full-length 3-D film. The film tells the story of an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Voiced by Edward Asner) whom trying to fulfill his late wife&#39;s dream by taking their house to South America. The only problem is, that an earnest Boy Scout named Russell (Voiced by Jordan Nagai) has tagged along, making the simple trip, so much, more complex. Can Carl make it to South America or will his late wife&#39;s dreams be shattered? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The movie is gorgeous and colorful. Sadly, the 3D isn&#39;t worth it, but it&#39;s still, beautiful to the eyes. I love the amazing music by Michael Giacchino. I just wish, the tune sound more South or Latin American, than European, because it would make more sense. The movie is unsurprisingly well action part. Great pacing. The film is also well-acted. Everybody did their parts, very well. Edward Asner was a great choice as Mr. Fredricksen. I love his grumpiness in his voice. The use of mostly grunts, make it seem, like his responses come from a protective stance, rather than his own grouchy nature. Jordan Nagai as Russell is just as likable. He has the most lines, in the film, and none of it, sounds too annoying. I guess, there was something, sweet about his voice. You really do hear it, whenever, Russell speaks. I love that the actor wasn&#39;t even trying to get cast for the role, but end up, getting it, over his brother who was. It show, how charming, his voice is. The supporting cast&#39;s voice acting is just as memorable. Christopher Plummer as the villain, Charles Muntz, the explorer was fun to listen to. Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog, was pretty amazing. His voice in this, remind me so much of veteran voice actor, Dom DeLuise. I also love the cameo from Pixar&#39;s own favorite actor, John Ratzenberger in his minor role. As much as I love the voice acting; I really love, how the cartoon characters appear in this film. I like how, they have more child-like appealing cartoony look. The whole over the top celebrity caricatured facial appearances kinda works, because the older computer model for humans, used in Toy Story 1&amp;2 are just way too bland-looking and unappeased. It has that creepy uncanny valley look to it. Anyways, I think, the new model gives the movie, the amount of surrealism to make the plot to work. I really doubt, the film could work, with more realistic facial appearances, because how bizarre, the premise is. While, the appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, 1967&#39;s Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner. I like his short square status, and cartoony facial expressions. It makes Carl stand out. Unlike some critics, I also love, how Russell look. He doesn&#39;t look, like a kid with Down syndrome. He looks like a normal kid. I think, they were a little too harsh in their judgment. I also love the fact, that Russell is clearly Asian American, but his character lack the typical Asian over-stereotyping. Surprising, it makes the character, so much, more appealing, because it&#39;s not stepping over to over-used racial clichés. Charles F. Muntz really looks like, an old explorer, but his character&#39;s looks was a bit jarring. I really had a hard time, believing, that he&#39;s that well maintain, at his age, when he spent, most of the film, living for so long, outside of civilization. In my opinion, he should have, look, a little more broken-down. Last is Dug. He&#39;s a very realistic looking golden retriever. I own one, and they got it exactly right. I like how he closes his mouth and freezes when he notices a squirrel. Funny moment right there. For the story, it&#39;s both a hit and miss. I love that the film deals with more adult like drama, than childish antics. Having Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife, gave the movie, so much depth. It was really needed. However, besides the awesome and unexpected genuine tearjerker opening marriage montage, the film goes into another direction, with its absurdity. It&#39;s really off the wall, crazy and convenient, that Carl able to travel to South America in the way, he&#39;s traveling. The movie takes great artistic license, when it comes to engineering and physics. You have to really, be willing to suspension your disbelief from the rest of the entire film. Especially, when Russell was designed to be the child that Carl and his wife were unable to have, in both a figurative and literal spirit. Another thing, I didn&#39;t get about the plot, is how Charles Muntz can be, easily discredited. Clearly, the amount of what he found, in his short life, would give, his statements about the exotic bird, some credit. Clearly, much of the unexplainable questions in the plot, could be solve in the Carl is crazy theory that certain people has latch on. In theory, Carl didn&#39;t travel to South America, instead the Balloons are metaphors, reflecting Carl&#39;s happy and uplifting memories of his wife. Hints, why he was stubbornly clinging to them and refuses to let go, as if he&#39;s afraid he&#39;s going to fall. It wasn&#39;t until he did, was he able to live life, once more. Other people have notice, some themes similarity in the plot to John Milton&#39;s great poems Paradise Lost, Harvey Potter&#39;s Balloon Farm by Jerdine Nolen, and most of all, several really obvious references to Studio Ghibli. Overall: It deserve its good praise. A must-watch. Things can only go up from here."

As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn&#39;t cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect.

        "text": "I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn&#39;t be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar&#39;s masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.<br/><br/>First of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino&#39;s music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E&#39;s haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.<br/><br/>I have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn&#39;t a dog talk? It&#39;s an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don&#39;t fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.<br/><br/>And finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "text": "If there&#39;s a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It&#39;d be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I&#39;d place it among so much stellar work.<br/><br/>Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you&#39;re looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it&#39;s the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There&#39;s an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don&#39;t feel gives anything away. It&#39;s pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you&#39;re reminded of it, but I suppose it&#39;s up to one&#39;s own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.<br/><br/>Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don&#39;t really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that&#39;s just simply unprecedented. <br/><br/>I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn&#39;t really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you&#39;re better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn&#39;t take away from Up mind you, it just didn&#39;t add to it either. <br/><br/>Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It&#39;s pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we&#39;re entitled to the entertainment. It&#39;s nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don&#39;t know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie."

After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar&#39;s new high water mark, Up.<br/><br/>My favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl&#39;s life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no &quot;new&quot; technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.<br/><br/>As the associate producer who participated in the Q&amp;A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they&#39;ll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar&#39;s commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here. All of the good press is true, and I can&#39;t wait to see it again. Thanks for staying true to yourselves Pixar!"

        "text": "Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young &quot;wilderness explorer&quot; Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.<br/><br/>The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.<br/><br/>Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.<br/><br/>What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a &quot;bird&quot; named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl&#39;s backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.<br/><br/>But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up&#39;s favour.<br/><br/>But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl&#39;s facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).<br/><br/>I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.<br/><br/>10/10."

        "text": "I was luckily able to catch a screening a few weeks ago here in Houston.<br/><br/>As an avid lover of Wall-E, I felt Pixar could never reach those heights again.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>UP&#39;s story will probably seem peculiar at first glance. An old man as a protagonist? It definitely blew my expectations. The first 5 minutes demolished every other Pixar feature just because it was the first time I cried in a theater.<br/><br/>This just shows how much heart there is to the movie. I really don&#39;t want to get into specifics because of spoilers but the movie literally has everything.<br/><br/>Amazing visual effects.<br/><br/>Amazing sound.<br/><br/>Hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>Breath taking action.<br/><br/>Heart.<br/><br/>All those combined equal something special. Today&#39;s movies like to blow you away with gimmicks, Pixar is different. Each movie shows soul and UP definitely has it.<br/><br/>I can&#39;t wait until it comes out so I can see it in 3d, im bringing everybody.<br/><br/>10/10"

      "plot_summary": "Young Carl Fredricksen idolizes explorer Charles F. Muntz and befriends tomboy Ellie, who dreams of moving their neighborhood clubhouse to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls in Venezuela. Carl and Ellie marry, restore a house in the neighborhood, save toward a trip to Paradise Falls but repeatedly spend the money on necessities; Ellie dies after giving Carl her scrapbook and the two never make the trip. Decades later, 78-year-old widower Carl resists the neighborhood's redevelopment, injures a construction worker trying to protect his mailbox, and is ordered to move to a retirement home. To keep his promise to Ellie, Carl attaches thousands of helium balloons to his house and lifts it into the sky bound for Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell, who came to Carl's doorstep seeking a merit badge for assisting the elderly, is accidentally carried along as a stowaway. During a storm the house lands on a high South American plateau opposite Paradise Falls where the balloons are losing lift. Carl and Russell explore the plateau, tethered to the buoyant house, and encounter a giant, colorful flightless bird (Russell names her Kevin) and a talking dog named Dug, whose collar translates his thoughts. A pack of dogs with tracking collars hunts the bird; their master is Charles Muntz, now a reclusive, obsessive adventurer living aboard a massive dirigible. Muntz initially greets Carl as a hero but quickly reveals he has become paranoid and violent in his quest to capture proof of Kevin. After Russell's friendship with Kevin is exposed, Muntz becomes hostile and imprisons Kevin on the zeppelin. Carl, Russell, Kevin and Dug escape and try to return Kevin to her chicks, but Muntz's dogs pursue them. Muntz's hunting party captures Kevin with a net; he burns under the tethered house to force Carl to choose between saving his home or Kevin. Carl attempts to save both; he retrieves Ellie's scrapbook and reads her final note, which urges him to have new adventures. Russell, determined, sails off on balloons to rescue Kevin and is captured by Muntz. Carl empties the house, follows in pursuit, boards Muntz's airship, and frees Russell and Kevin. A chase across the dirigible ends with Muntz lunging after them, snagging on balloon lines; he falls to his death. The house is torn free and descends out of sight; Carl accepts losing it. Kevin is reunited with her chicks in the jungle, Muntz's airship returns to the city with the animals, and Carl proudly presents Russell with his final Wilderness Explorer badge plus Ellie's grape-soda-bottle-cap “Ellie badge.” The film ends with Carl living a fuller life as a surrogate grandfather to Russell, and the house resting on the cliff beside Paradise Falls as Ellie had wanted.",

      "young carl fredricksen (ed asner) is a quiet bespectacled boy wearing an old pilot's cap and goggles who idolizes renowned explorer charles f. muntz (christopher plummer). he is saddened to learn, however, that muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant bird he had claimed to have discovered in paradise falls, venezuela, south america, and was fired. intent on proving them wrong, muntz is seen boarding his zeppelin called the spirit of adventure, with his team of dogs and promises to return once he has brought back living proof of his find. the zeppelin was designed by muntz himself, and has all the comforts of modern life, including a doggy bath and a mechanical dog walker. one day, carl befriends an energetic and somewhat eccentric tomboy named ellie, who is also a muntz fan. ellie invites carl to join her club, and to commemorate the occasion she gives him a grape soda bottle cap as a badge. ellie is the outspoken, adventurous type, who pushes carl out of his comfort zone to try new adventures. she confides to carl her desire to move her \"clubhouse\", an abandoned house in the neighborhood, to a cliff overlooking paradise falls, making him promise to help her. carl and ellie eventually get married and grow old together in the restored house, working as a toy balloon vendor and a zookeeper, respectively. carl and ellie make a beautiful life together, spending time with each other and enjoying nature. ellie suffers a miscarriage, and it is implied that she is infertile. when they are told by a doctor that they are unable to have children, they save for a trip to paradise falls but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs like a new car tire, carl's accident (which caused a leg fracture), house repairs when a tree fell on it during a storm and so on.\nmany years later, a now elderly carl decides to surprise ellie with tickets to south america, but she falls ill and is hospitalized, giving carl her scrapbook before dying soon after. now in his late 70s, carl holds out while the neighborhood around him is redeveloped. he refuses to sell. he ends up injuring a construction worker over damage done to his mailbox. he is evicted from the house by court order due to being deemed a \"public menace\" and is ordered to move to a retirement home. however, carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to ellie. workers from shady oaks retirement home arrive to pick him up the following morning but are shocked to find carl releasing millions of helium balloons into the air which detach his house from its foundation, lifting it over the city and into the sky. he turns his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons to lift it off its foundation. he uses curtains as sails and the wind pane as a rudder to control direction and speed. carl sets a course for south america. a 13 year young member of the \"wilderness explorers\", tribe 54, sweat lodge 12 (a youth organization) named russell (jordan nagai) becomes an accidental passenger, having pestered carl earlier in an attempt to earn his final merit badge, \"assisting the elderly\". russell was missing this last badge to become a senior wilderness explorer. carl has asked russell to find a snipe that had been bothering him, and russell had come over to provide a progress report when carl unfurled the balloons. russell was stuck on the front porch of the house.\ncarl lets him in and decides to descend to return russell home before a severe storm hits. after surviving a thunderstorm, the house lands near a large ravine facing paradise falls. carl releases some balloons to descend but they hit ground early and are knocked out of the house. they manage to hold onto it using a hose attached to the porch while the fog lifts to reveal that they are standing on a high plateau opposite paradise falls. unable to climb back into the house, carl and russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it around the ravine, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. meanwhile, a chase is progressing in the jungle. three dogs with red lights on their collars are in hot pursuit of what appears to be a giant bird, but they lose the trail when their sensitive ears pick up the fine tuning of carl's hearing aid. carl and russell later befriend a tall, colorful flightless bird (whom russell names \"kevin\") trying to reach her chicks, and then a dog named dug (bob peterson), whose collar has a device that translates his thoughts into human speech. after failed attempts to evade the animals, carl reluctantly allows both to join the party. kevin loudly calls out and is answered by smaller calls. dug says that kevin is calling to her babies, and russell realizes that kevin is a girl. meanwhile, the three dogs seen chasing the bird earlier have picked up the scent of carl and russell, who they nickname the mailman. the leader alpha (bob peterson), a doberman pinscher, tells beta (delroy lindo), a rottweiler, and gamma (jerome ranft), a bulldog, that they must be vigilant and continue their search. alpha had sent dug on a fools errand to keep him occupied, but when he turns on the collar communication device, alpha realizes that dug has found the bird and is with carl and russell. alpha turns on the tracking beacon on dug's collar to find his position.\ncarl and russell encounter the pack of dogs led by alpha, but kevin has already run off. they are taken to dug's master, who turns out to be elderly 92 years old charles muntz. muntz invites carl and russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains that he has spent the years since his disgrace searching paradise falls for the giant bird. the zeppelin is anchored inside a large and tall cave, where mintz lives with his dogs. the dogs serve muntz and even do his cooking for him. carl's initial excitement over meeting his hero fades as he becomes aware that muntz's obsession has driven him insane. after muntz shows them the bird skeleton, russell notes its resemblance to kevin. muntz says that he has tried to smoke the bird out of its habitat, but sometimes years go by between sightings. the bird's habitat is a labyrinth, which has no way out and muntz has already lost many dogs in the process.\nwhen russell innocently reveals his friendship with kevin (indicating that he attracted the bird with chocolate), muntz becomes disturbingly hostile. muntz reveals that he has murdered other travelers he suspected of also seeking the bird. muntz reveals a table of head mannequins wearing various headgear and grimly knocks each one off with his cane as he describes the stories their wearers told him (a surveyor making a map, a botanist making a catalog of the plants); claiming that each one was actually after his bird.\nthis is when kevin enters the cave and gives out a call, distracting muntz. this gives an opportunity to carl and russel to run out of the zeppelin.\nthis prompts carl, russell, kevin and dug to flee, chased by muntz's dogs. riding on kevin's back and assisted by dug, who calls carl his new master, they barely escape capture by muntz's dogs, though kevin is injured in the process. hearing kevin call out to her chicks, carl agrees to take her home. just before kevin can re-enter her labyrinth home, a net flies out and captures her. muntz and his dogs have arrived in the zeppelin, led to the spot by a tracking device on dug's collar.\nmuntz eventually catches up with them and starts a fire beneath carl's house, forcing carl to choose between saving his home or kevin. carl rushes to put out the fire, allowing muntz to take the bird. carl and russell eventually reach the falls, but russell is angry with carl. settling into his home, carl discovers photos of their married life in ellie's childhood scrapbook and a final note from his wife thanking him for the \"adventure\" and encouraging him to go on a new one. reinvigorated, he goes to find russell, only to see him sailing off on some balloons to rescue kevin. carl empties the house of his furniture and possessions and pursues him. russell is captured by muntz, but carl boards the dirigible in flight and frees both russell and kevin. muntz pursues them around the airship, finally cornering dug, kevin, and russell inside carl's tethered house. carl lures kevin out through a window and back onto the airship with dug and russell clinging to her back, just as muntz is about to close in, muntz leaps after them, only to snag his foot on some balloon lines and fall to his death. snapped from its tether, the house descends out of sight through the clouds, which carl accepts as being for the best. carl, russell and dug reunite kevin with her chicks, then fly the dirigible back to the city. when russell's father misses his son's senior explorer ceremony, carl proudly presents russell with his final badge for assisting the elderly, as well as a personal addition: the grape soda cap that ellie gave to carl when they first met (which he dubs the \"ellie badge\"). meanwhile, carl's house is shown to have landed on the cliff beside paradise falls, as promised to ellie.\na series of photographs shows carl enjoying his latest adventure: living an active life as a surrogate grandfather to russell."

        "summary": "Disney comes through with yet another animated masterpiece, and this one goes by the name Mulan.",
        "text": "Mulan is a young girl in ancient China. When the Huns start attacking the country, the Emperor orders one member of every family to join the Chinese Army and defend the country. The one member must be a man, but in Mulan&#39;s family, the only male is her injured father. Not wanting to allow her father to die, Mulan dresses like a man, and escapes into the night to join the war. To protect her, the ancient elders of her family ask the great Stone Dragon to watch over her. Unfortunately, the great Stone Dragon is destroyed by the little tiny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy). So with Mushu and a small cricket by her side, Mulan heads off to help destroy the Huns.<br/><br/>\nI think we can all guess what happens. Mulan, although a woman, manages to save the day. The plot line isn&#39;t really a surprise when you break it down. And the animation is, by now, expected to be great, and Mulan certainly lives up to the great Disney tradition. It&#39;s the story and the feeling you get that makes this movie so wonderful. Disney went through a lot to make sure it&#39;s depiction of ancient China was accurate. From the decorations on the walls, to the matchmakers, to the great honor in family, Disney manages to show what the country of China was like, and in many ways, still is today. Following the Disney tradition, there is a strong female character, this time taking lead. There are the over the top bad guys, and of course, the comic relief. Eddie Murphy was just down right hilarious in this movie. I wish they had showed more of him. The songs were sort of a change of pace, with Matthew Wilder and Jerry Goldsmith doing the honors, and not the venerable Alan Menken. The music was good, but the lyrics in some of the songs were weak. <br/><br/>The reason I feel Mulan was better than recent Disney fare like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame is because it had a much more lively feel to it. Hercules was very dark, animation-wise. Everything was centered on the color blue, so it didn&#39;t feel alive. And The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a more adult story, and some of the scenes were very dark and broody. Mulan took a simple plot, put it in ancient China, and made it very colorful and fun to watch. It was light, and &quot;Disney&quot; enough for kids to enjoy, while still being adult enough for the parents to enjoy. <br/><br/>Overall, I&#39;d say Mulan is definitely one to watch. Disney animation has done it again."

        "summary": "Thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!",
        "text": "Mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national hero/heroine. Although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, Disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. As a Chinese myself, I know the mulan story like millions of Chinese people do. Some people (espcially Chinese people) may not like the Disney version of mulan simply because Disney didn&#39;t stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. Not only did i have no problem with Disney&#39;s decision to make modifications to mulan&#39;s story, I actually kinda appreciate that they did. Cuz Disney&#39;s retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. I mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in Disney&#39;s mulan. In the Disney version, Mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient Chinese society, where a woman&#39;s value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. So naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number &quot;reflection&quot; that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. This song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and I&#39;m a guy! This song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. And now back to the movie, there&#39;s a lot to love about Disney&#39;s mulan: the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. The story is smoothly-paced and very believable. You have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. And I think Disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real Chinese people instead of the classic Disney characters that we used to see. And they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful Chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me! And the opening of the movie is probably one of the most brilliant among the Disney animation features. I was completely blown away when i first saw it in the theater. Although Disney didn&#39;t completely stay true to the original mulan, it stayed true to the spirit of the original story and the spirit of china in most part! And as Mulan being a Chinese story, i think Disney did its best to make it look like and feel like Chinese, and i really appreciate their effort. So thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!"

        "summary": "The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.",
        "text": "One of the reasons why I like Mulan so much, is because she is independent and braver than many of the female characters from Disney, who looks always to be searching for a man to be the reason for them to live or to be happy. Mulan is lovely, but also a tomboy what always gives her problems. Since the story takes place in a China of more than 1.000 years ago, women from that time, more than in the present days, needed to have an outstanding behavior all the time and with everybody.Being the only kid her parents had in a time where women didn&#39;t have many rights,Mulan is pressed to marry with a good catch. One day, she is going to see the matchmaker but everything goes wrong,since she is clumsy and not very graceful. Being accused that she &#39;&#39; will never bring honor to her family&#39;&#39;, Mulan stays sad and depressed, and so stays her parents. But the chance to change that awful prophecy comes quick when the Emperor&#39;s men started to call one man from every family to serve in the Imperial Army: since Mulan&#39;s father was no longer young and healthy, Mulan reported to the army with a new name and looks. But she needed to make this a secret, because it was against the Chinese laws to a woman be a soldier, so, with the help of the dragon of the family called Mushu,one of the coolest adventures from Disney&#39;s starts."

        "summary": "Why Mulan sticks out as a great Disney film.",
        "text": "I was impressed by this Disney film for so many reasons, too many to list here, but I will go on the record as saying that Mulan has got to be one of the best Disney female characters that ever saw production, in the midst of a colorful and artistic film, that will resonate in your memory.<br/><br/>Mulan sticks out in my mind for this reason. For once, we have a strong female lead, or at the least, stronger than most of them. She isn&#39;t counted among the Disney &quot;princesses&quot; line-up. She doesn&#39;t want for herself, and she seeks to look deeper within herself to discover her inner being. She isn&#39;t like Ariel, who wants to be someone else. She isn&#39;t like Jasmine, who sits in luxury, waiting to be swept off her feet by Prince Charming, just like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and almost any female character that Disney brings to life. And while she does share some traits among this list, she stands out because she does something that these do not. She uses her mind. <br/><br/>Mulan, in fact, has more in common with male Disney leads than the female Disney leads. Mulan is a thinker, and a do-er. She&#39;s resourceful, like Aladdin. She is quick to act, like Eric (mermaid.) And she sacrifices herself for the sake of others, like Hercules. She also speaks her mind, even in a culture that does not allow such a thing. She doesn&#39;t waste time pining about &quot;will I ever find true love?&quot; Indeed, we see that she has an attraction to Shang (as he was her husband in the legends,) but we see her uncomfortable and unsure of meeting the Match-maker. She begs for her father&#39;s life when Chi-Fu came to the village. When you see her make her decision to take her father&#39;s place in the army, she does so out of her love for him, valuing his life above hers. She doesn&#39;t wish to become a man to see what it is like or for a change. Only to save his life. She later doubts herself and her reasons for going, but she did so because of her inner strengths, something other female Disney leads too often lack. (And it is these strengths that Shang is attracted to at the end.)<br/><br/>This movie also has a simple, but very effective villain, Shan Yu. Though not as memorable as Jafar or Ursula, he is more effective and more menacing because he is not fantastic. By that, I mean that he is not magical, he holds no special power. He is portrayed as a man, and as a man that could have truly existed, performing vicious acts that men do. We see the destruction that his army lays to a village, and when Mulan finds the doll, it shows that Shan Yu left no one living, man, woman or child. This is what makes him so effective as a villain, showing how truly human he indeed is. Granted, the producers did not develop him in any great depth, but they showed enough of him to remind us of his threat to China. Besides, sometimes the better villains are the ones you don&#39;t know too much about, or see a lot of.<br/><br/>Of the rest of the supporting cast, I will only mention four of them as being memorable in any real way. Chi-Fu, the emperor&#39;s consultant, was a reminder of the way many men looked at women in this culture. He thrusts his head up when Mulan begs for her father&#39;s life, and when she is discovered to be a woman, though she is a hero, he is quick to insult her, and to order her execution, simply because she impersonated a man. The other three were, of course, her comrades, Ling, Yao, and Chian Po. Though they were mainly comic relief (almost like a 3 stooges set,) they remained loyal to Mulan and trusted her fully, even after she was discovered. I like them, because they were not discriminatory to her in any way, even trying to stop her execution. When Mulan told them she had an idea to help the emperor faster, they were the first to her side, even when Shang was still reluctant to do so.<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful movie to the Disney list. If you haven&#39;t seen it, then do so, you won&#39;t regret it.<br/><br/>And yes, Mushu was a cool character as well.<br/><br/>**** In Response to an earlier post by Phoenix-1 **** To expect any movie to accurately portray history in any way is lunacy. Even those movies that come close to historical accuracy are flawed in many ways. This was a way of telling a story, as any movie is. It can be argued that it tries to provoke curiosity in another culture, but it is also meant to entertain. I would also like to point out that Mulan is really not &quot;historical,&quot; like Joan of Arc, but rather she is a legend, much like Hercules and Aladdin, who also come from the realm of myth, stories and legends. And while there is some difference between the original legend and this movie, your examples of how Disney would butcher tales of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln do not compare to this story in any way. Your arguments for comparison should be better applied to Pocahontas, as she was an actual historical figure."

One is that I love the fact that Disney is exploring legends from other cultures and I am so glad it brought us this one.  The other is that I just wanted to stand up and cheer at this great heroine.  I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but most of the heroines, while spunky, are still just your basic damsel in distress.  I loved Mulan&#39;s character.  She was strong, she was powerful, she could do anything she wanted, and she overcame much diversity.  I was thrilled to see the portrayal of a strong female character surviving because of her own integrity and strength rather than because of her looks.  Bravo, Disney, for bringing us this wonderfully progressive Chinese tale."

        "text": "Every Disney movie is always advertised as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, but Mulan is one of the few that REALLY fit the bill.  The animation itself is simple and flowing, reminiscent of ancient Chinese art.  But the animation for this is really something else.  In fact, this is the best thing since The Lion King.<br/><br/>Mulan is a young girl who does her best to bring honor to her family.  Then, when the Hun army invades China, one man from every household must serve in the Imperial Army.  Since Mulan has no older brothers, her crippled father must serve.  And it&#39;s obvious, early on in the movie, that it&#39;s impossible for him to fight with a crippled leg.  There&#39;s a great likelihood that this man is going to die in battle.<br/><br/>So, out of the sheer love for her father, Mulan disguises herself in his armor and takes his place in the army.<br/><br/>This movie isn&#39;t about some gal going off to war to prove herself, or break free from the caste system, like so many other Disney heroines.  And it isn&#39;t about &quot;finding your prince and living happily ever after&quot;.  Mulan goes for the simple love of her father and because of the her dedication to her family.  She risks losing everything to SAVE everything.<br/><br/>Mulan is a wonderful movie because the main character is realistic.  She&#39;s not perfect, she has her faults, and we all identify with her because we all try out best to please our fathers.  This is one of the few movies I watched with my dad that he really liked, and he isn&#39;t that fond of animated stuff. It&#39;s a great film.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s what makes a true masterpiece."

It turned out to be an actual pleasure watching this film. It had great animation, a good soundtrack, and a wonderful story about courage and strength.<br/><br/>Mulan is a girl in China who is ready for marriage but seems like she isn&#39;t ready to settle down in this man&#39;s world where she must have permission to speak and only cook and please her husband. When her father is called to war, she fears for his life and dresses like him and fights in his place disguised as him. Mushu, her &quot;guardian&quot; dragon per say, comes to help her out and make sure she doesn&#39;t get herself killed out there in battle. She also falls for the captain that doesn&#39;t kill her when he finds out her secret.<br/><br/>It is a visually stunning masterpiece that I am glad that I had a chance to watch. It had great morals and values for children, even if it was a bit unrealistic, we have to let go. Still, I don&#39;t think a film will compare yet to The Lion King or Beauty and The Beast, but Mulan is a treasure of it&#39;s own.<br/><br/>7/10"

        "text": "I have a 4.5 year old daughter who is going through the princess phase. We read lots of fairy tales etc and its very difficult to find a fairy tale where the princess is strong and resourceful. Most of the time they are pretty passive and the worst one is sleeping beauty. I find myself treading a fine line between letting her enjoy the fairy tale and occasionally commenting on the fact that perhaps some of these princesses just don&#39;t do enough to help themselves and how they can help themselves a little bit more. I don&#39;t want to destroy her pleasure in these fairy tales, after all, I loved them too. But it took me a while as adult to see how the subconscious message of helplessness in these fairy tales can reinforce the existing values of society and parents that girls are meant to be saved. <br/><br/>So it is a great pleasure to be able to show my daughter a story of a strong and intelligent girl - Mu Lan and its great that Mu Lan and we are both ethnically Chinese. Here is a heroine who is resourceful, uses her brains, saves the Captain and China. We draw many discussion points from the story, such as why it is that women were not allowed to join the army, the value of trying hard and training and practising hard, what is discipline and why it is needed to succeed, using your brains and thinking of how to solve a problem, not just using brute strength, etc. Even some politics - like why did the Hun king want the Emperor to bow to him and why the Emperor wouldn&#39;t bow to him but would bow to Mulan. My challenge is the explain things in a way which is both accurate and yet understandable to a 4 year old. My daughter loves the story because Mulan does a lot of &quot;saving&quot;. <br/><br/>My daughter has probably watch the movie only 3 times coz I limit TV and video a lot. But she&#39;ll ask me to tell her the story in my own words, based on the video. It works out great.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie Mulan captivates me as an adult also helps. There&#39;s only so much I can enjoy of a barney video. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie to parents with young girls, as a good place to start talking about being a strong and intelligent woman. Another good one is Beauty and the Beast. I&#39;ve not seen Pocahontas so I can&#39;t comment on that."

The script has some funny lines. <br/><br/>The music is not great (the writers didn&#39;t ring any bells with me as to their past work) but good lyrics. I was disappointed that the music wasn&#39;t as Asianish as &quot;Lion King&quot; is Africanish. And the final rap is a bit off-putting, though the segue into the Stevie Wonder song was fun.<br/><br/>Eddie Murray isn&#39;t Robin Williams but he&#39;s fun. At least they do use quite a few Asian actors&#39; voices - Wing Na Wen (&quot;E.R.&quot;), George Takei (&quot;Star Trek&quot;), B.D. Wong (&quot;Oz&quot;) Pat Morita (&quot;Karate Kid&quot;). <br/><br/>I think &quot;Mulan&quot; is the first Disney animation post-Katzenberg and there&#39;s a couple of digs at him and responses to the criticisms of how he did the girl stars. There was a lot of criticism of how Katzenberg personally insisted on Jasmine in &quot;Aladdin&quot;s impossible Barbie shape and &quot;Mulan&quot; takes that on with a line about how stupid it is to want such a narrow waist. Definitely a much more positive body image movie than under the Katzenberg regime. <br/><br/>There&#39;s no dead mother syndrome here, well for Mulan anyway. The Captain&#39;s mother isn&#39;t mentioned. Not only is there a mom, but even a grandmom. The father is still Freudian - he&#39;s wounded. All the Disney dads of daughters have some incapacity or other or tragic flaw.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, there&#39;s no wedding at the end with birds chirping as a canopy. The courting is assumed and the grandmom invites the captain to live there forever--but Mulan shuts her up. <br/><br/>(originally written 7/23/1998)"

      "plot_summary": "When Hun leader Shan Yu breaches China’s northern border, the Imperial court orders one man from each family to join the army. In a village, tomboyish Fa Mulan fails a matchmaker visit and fears bringing dishonor when her elderly, lame father Fa Zhou is conscripted. To spare him, Mulan cuts her hair, takes Fa Zhou’s armor and horse Khan, and leaves disguised as a son named “Ping.” Her grandmother’s ancestors debate her actions; the disgraced tiny dragon Mushu is sent (after accidentally destroying the stone guardian) to rouse the guardian but instead accompanies Mulan to redeem himself. Mulan joins basic training under Captain Li Shang alongside recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po; initially clumsy, she gradually masters soldiering—helped by Mushu’s schemes—and earns the men’s respect. Chi-Fu, the emperor’s adviser, remains skeptical and later reports Li Shang’s troops unfit.\nGeneral Shang (General Li?) leads the army north but is ambushed; Li Shang pursues Shan Yu to a mountain pass. During the confrontation, Mulan rigs the last huolongchushui cannon to trigger an avalanche that buries the Hun army, apparently killing Shan Yu. Mulan is wounded in the battle; her gender is revealed when Li Shang treats her wound. Bound by military law, Li Shang spares her life but expels her; the company marches to the Imperial City to claim victory while Mulan is left behind. Mushu admits he lied about being sent by the ancestors; Cri-Kee admits he isn’t truly lucky.\nShan Yu survives and infiltrates the Imperial City, hiding among the returning troops and seizing the palace, taking the Emperor captive. Mulan sneaks into the city and warns Li Shang, who does not believe her; when the Huns seize the palace, Li Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po—now convinced—accept her plan. Mulan and the others infiltrate the palace (disguising most as concubines) and free the Emperor. Mulan lures Shan Yu onto the imperial roof and fights him; Mushu ignites a large firework that blasts Shan Yu off the roof and kills him. After the battle, Chi-Fu attempts to punish Mulan for impersonation, but the Emperor publicly honors her bravery, presents her with Shan Yu’s sword and a medallion, and offers her a position on his council. Mulan declines and returns home with the Emperor’s gifts. At the Fa household, Fa Zhou embraces Mulan rather than the trophies; Li Shang arrives, returns Mulan’s helmet, and accepts her invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is restored as the Fa family guardian by the ancestors.",

      "shan yu (miguel ferrer) is a hun & attacks china after the emperor builds the great wall. general shigeta is in charge of defenses. shan yu has already crossed the northern borders when the news reaches the royal court. chi-fu (james hong) is the emperor's adviser and assistant.\nin the imperial city, the emperor (pat morita) orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the imperial chinese army. mulan (ming-na wen) is a tom boyish village girl who fails at finding herself a good husband. mulan is expected to be quiet, graceful, polite, punctual and demure. mulan has a pet horse khan (frank welker) and cricket cri-kee (frank welker). she is arranged to meet a matchmaker (miriam margolyes) to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. fa-zhou (soon-tek oh) prays to the ancestors to help mulan impress the matchmaker and bring honor to the family. fa li (freda foh shen) is her mother and her grandmother fa (june foray). in these times women bring honor to their family by getting married to a suitable groom and giving birth to boys, who can serve the emperor. women are only expected to conduct house chores and look beautiful. mulan is bathed and dressed up for her meeting with the matchmaker. grandmother fa adds cri-kee to mulan's outfit for extra luck. following a few mishaps (mulan had taken notes on her hand, and when the matchmaker holds her arm the ink is transferred to her palm and from there to the matchmaker's face. then cri-kee gets into the matchmakers dress, and she falls on hot coals), the matchmaker deems her a disgrace to the family. mulan is heartbroken and know that if she is herself, she will never bring honor to her family. fa-zhou consoles mulan and says that she is just a late bloomer and when her time comes, she will bring honor to the family. mulan's father fa zhou is summoned by imperial army to serve the emperor against the huns. fa zhou is old and has a limp in his leg (but he would not even consider not going as that would mean dishonor for the family for generations), so mulan goes instead, dressed as a man. mulan takes fa-zhou's orders, his sword and armor and rides away on khan. when her absence is discovered, fa-zhou refuses to go after her, as if mulan is found impersonating a man, she will be killed. mulan's grandmother prays to the family's ancestors (mary kay bergman) for mulan's safety. in the local temple, mushu (eddie murphy), a small red dragon, is a disgraced former family guardian who is demoted to the role of awakening the spirits of the ancestors. mushu was demoted when he was sent to protect fa-deng and his misguidance led to disaster, with fa-deng being decapitated.\nthe ancestors argue whether mulan's actions are right or not, and the ancestors are split in 2 camps on the issue. the great ancestor (george takei) decides that the powerful stone dragon guardian should guide mulan; and sends mushu to wake him. after accidentally destroying the guardian's statue, mushu travels to mulan's aid himself (after cri-kee talks to mushu and gives him this idea), desiring to redeem himself to the ancestors by making mulan a war hero. cri-kee decides to travel with mushu, just to make sure that he doesn't get mulan in trouble. as china continues to prepare for war, shan yu and the huns are riding quickly through the wilderness toward the city. shan-yu sets fire to all the villages in his path. he has an eagle that soars above the battlefield and informs shan-yu of any unseen dangers. hun soldiers capture two imperial scouts, and shan yu tauntingly instructs them to tell the emperor to send his finest troops to battle the huns. reasoning that it only takes one man to deliver a message, shan yu has one of the scouts executed.\nmeanwhile mulan is practicing how to be a man, just outside the army camp where she is supposed to report. mushu links up with mulan (mulan is not convinced that her ancestors send her a little lizard to help her) & devises a plan to make mulan a war hero to restore her family's honor & secure his own place as the guardian of ancestral temple. mushu teaches mulan to walk and talk like a man.\nmulan meets fellow soldiers yao (harvey fierstein), chien-po (jerry tondo), and ling (gedde watanabe). mushu's advise of hitting men and slapping their behinds only leads to a brawl and mulan barely manages to escape.\ncaptain li shang (bd wong) is general shigeta's son & in charge of training. general shigeta takes the trained soldiers to stop shan yu at a pass, and leaves li shang in charge of the camp. shigeta argues that li shang was at the top of his class, is well versed in military techniques and has an impressive military lineage, and so is the right person for the post. chi-fu is not happy with li shang's appointment and promises to keep a close eye on him for any mistakes.\nli shang has a tough assignment on his hands to train the troops as they are totally undisciplined. mulan gives her name as ping and says that ping is fa-zhou's son. chi-fu believes this as \"ping\" is clumsy and awkward.\nthe remaining soldiers turn against ping as li shang punishes them for ping's mistakes and make him sleep outside of their camp. li shang starts training the troops. their first task is to retrieve an arrow from the top of a tall mast, by wearing 2 heavy weights in their wrists. yao and his buddies continue to undermine \"ping\" by tripping him or putting insects down his shirt.\nat first mulan is clumsy & disgraceful. mushu helps mulan cheat and pass the tests, but she is often caught by li shang. slowly mulan learns all the skills & surpasses all fellow soldiers at the defense arts. mulan is the first to retrieve the arrow from the top of the mast. with time, the other soldiers accept \"ping\" as their friend and comrade.\nthe guys enter the lake when mulan was bathing there, and she is trapped. she is only able to get away when mushu bites one of the men and they believe that there is a snake in the lake. the confusion and chaos allow mulan to escape with khan's help. shan yu attacks the village that general shigeta is defending as he already knew from his eagle that an ambush was set up for him. though the soldiers have successfully completed training, but army supervisor chi fu (james fong) is skeptical of the progress captain li has made and declares that in his report he will mark the troops as unfit for battle. mushu also finds that mulan is attracted to li shang.\nmushu, afraid of losing the plot fakes a letter to chi fu from general shigeta requesting all available troops at the front line. the ruse works, and shang marches the troops out of camp the following day.\non their march, the guys dream of becoming a hero and marrying a beautiful girl. but nobody wants a girl with a brain and one who speaks her own mind. li shang's troops arrive at the village to find the army destroyed & shigeta dead. li decides to pursue shan yu before he gets to the imperial city.\nwhile pursuing, mushu accidentally sets off a cannon giving away li's position in the mountain pass. li shang's men use their cannons to attack the archers atop the mountain, but li shang asks them to save the last cannon. when the cannons are exhausted, shan yu attacks with his huge army. as the soldiers march up a mountain pass, they are ambushed by the huns. mulan cleverly uses the last huolongchushui cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries the entire hun army. shan yu is himself buried in the resultant avalanche.\nmulan and khan risk their own lives to save li shang from being swept away in the avalanche. li shang's soldiers survive by hiding behind a rock and the avalanche tides over it. angered, shan yu wounds mulan during the battle, and her deception is revealed to li shang when the wound is bandaged. instead of executing mulan as the law requires, li shang spares her life (he says that his debt to her repaid by sparing her life, in exchanging for saving his) and expels her from the army. mulan is left behind as the other soldiers depart for the imperial city to report the huns' defeat. mulan miserably tells mushu that entering the army was a mistake, and that she was fated to dishonor her family. mushu finally admits that he was not sent by the ancestors, and that his mission was a selfish one to get his job back. even cri-kee confesses that he is not a truly lucky cricket.\nmushu consoles mulan and says that things will work out. he counsels her to return him and face her father.\nhowever, shan yu and several of his warriors have survived, and mulan sees them heading towards the city. in the city, captain shang and his troops are being hailed as heroes for defeating the huns. though surrounded by cheering citizens, shang, yao, ling, and chein-po are noticeably dejected. mulan enters the city and warns li shang, but he ignores her. mulan begs the other citizens to take notice of the danger, but they all ignore mulan as she is a girl.\nthe huns then secretly enter the city (being part of the victory parade), capture the emperor and seize the palace. knowing of mulan's knack for creative problem-solving, shang, yao, ling, and chien-po turn to her for a rescue plan. with all except shang disguising themselves as concubines, they infiltrate the palace and attack the huns guarding the chamber into which the emperor was taken. shan yu threatens to kill the emperor if he refuses to bow to him and accept him as the new leader of china. the emperor stoically refuses and shan yu prepares to strike, but shang leaps into action just in time. as shang and shan yu battle, chien-po carries the emperor to safety. mulan then attracts shan yu's attention by proving herself to be the soldier who started the avalanche, luring him to the roof of the palace for a final fight. mushu, armed with an enormous firework rocket, launches himself at shan yu. as the hun leader is blasted to smithereens in a colorful display, mulan and mushu drop to safety on the palace steps. as the chaos subsides, chi fu berates mulan for her actions. shang angrily defends her until the emperor appears. he explains to mulan that, despite her fraud, she has saved the entire nation of china. in the ultimate display of respect, the emperor bows to mulan, as do the countless people in the attending crowd. he then offers mulan a place in his council (to the shock of chi fu), but mulan respectfully declines and expresses her wish to return home. the emperor gives her his medallion and shan yu's sword as gifts to honor the fa family. back at the fa estate, fa zhou is overjoyed at the return of his daughter. though mulan presents him with the emperor's crest and the sword of shan yu, he casts the priceless gifts aside and embraces her, assuring her that she herself is the greatest honor to their family. captain shang arrives soon afterward, returning the helmet that mulan left behind, and awkwardly but happily accepts mulan's invitation to stay for dinner. mushu, at last, is restored to guardian status in the family temple. mulan thanks him for his help in her adventurous plan, and the ancestors celebrate that the fa family is complete again."

However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film&#39;s appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn&#39;t quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.<br/><br/>I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I&#39;ll just end it here!"

This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.<br/><br/>Now then: The movie itself is marvelous! The characters are gentle and funny; there is no gratuitous violence; there are innuendos, of course, but skillfully done in a way that the &quot;libretto&quot; if you will can be &quot;read&quot; at least two levels. The story line itself is charming, and the ending is a real, nifty surprise!<br/><br/>I add here that I&#39;ve watched this with my younger G_Kids, who loved it; and also with my bride of fifty years, who loved it.<br/><br/>It is in all ways in a class with the best that Mr. Jobs has so far produced, which is saying a great deal.<br/><br/>HIGHLY recommended as good, funny, charming entertainment for a whole bunch of ages.<br/><br/>Nick Fortis Los Altos California"

        "text": "The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes&#39; only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It&#39;s the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek&#39;s swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek&#39;s Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it&#39;s own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say &quot;that does not look right.&quot; There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike."

        "text": "9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of &quot;Shrek&quot;. We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs&#39; Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up &quot;WHAT&#39;s he compensating for?&quot; cracked me up...<br/><br/>Be warned that this movie is a non-stop send-up of all things Disney. If predictability and saccharine is your cup of tea, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you are cynical about theme parks and like the idea of fairytale classics getting the Monty Python treatment, you&#39;ll love it. Every time a scene looks familiar, it means it is about to go pear-shaped. And it&#39;s not just old classics that get the treatment. I spotted (mis)quotes from films that are just being released, both Disney and non-Disney. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in &quot;Shrek&quot;.<br/><br/>As a fairytale, however offbeat, &quot;Shrek&quot; is tighter plotted and better characterised than most Hollywood dross.The parodic twists, a love story subplot that owes more to Shakespeare&#39;s comedies than fairytale formula, and the &quot;ugly is the new beautiful&quot; Message more than make up for the derivativeness due to extensive quotation.<br/><br/>As for the acting, confinement to voice-overs keeps the egos of Myers and Murphy in check, and they do a fantastic job as the big fat green smelly recluse and the obnoxiously manic donkey respectively. Diaz is great as a feisty princess who reminds me of Lloyd Alexander&#39;s Eilonwy crossed with Lara Croft. Lithgow&#39;s Farquaad is a wonderful Bad Guy, modelled on Olivier&#39;s Richard III apart from his Little Problem being different. And the Fairytale Creatures...excellent, all of them. The graphics, of course, are state of the art for at least another 2 weeks. We&#39;re talking freckles, skin pores and stubble, pupil dilation, and amazing light-and-shade. They had to tone down the realism of the humanoids to stop them looking creepily android-like.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, except for overly precious schmalz addicts."

        "text": "I never set the bar too high for children or animated films because adults can never seem to get into them.  Adults go to animated films because their kids complain and fuss and drag them to see it with them.  Meanwhile, the parent is stuck there trying to watch the movie, but can&#39;t because all the children are either asleep or screaming their lungs out and the parent just wants to go see the new action flick playing right next door.  It&#39;s a waste of $7.00, I know.  However, Shrek was a real treat to go to and is meant for an older crowd.<br/><br/>The bedtime stories our parents used to tell us as children and which we pass down to ours is retold to please a much older crowd who grew up with these stories.  It&#39;s a spoof of all the fairy tales that we all know. However, this story has a wonderful twist to it.  There&#39;s no prince charming and there&#39;s no dashing night to save the day.  Shrek is an ogar, who has to rescue the princesses so he can get back his land from the storybook characters that have overrun it.<br/><br/>Mike Myers is witty and brilliant as the voice of Shrek.  He allows the role of Shrek to come alive.  This probably has to be one of Mike Myers&#39; better films, and the great thing about working as a voice animator is that you don&#39;t have to spend three hours in make up and another hour or so in wardrobe.  You can just get up at six o&#39; clock in the morning go in say your lines and get out.<br/><br/>The other great thing about this movie is that it spoofs of such movies as the matrix and almost any fairy tale ever made.  However, it so original in plot.<br/><br/>Eddie Murphy steals the screen as the talking donkey.  It seems everything out of his mouth gets wittier and wittier throughout the entire movie.  He brightens up the screen with a zany performance.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz shines as the princesses.  She enlightens us with her witty charm and surprising outbursts.   John Lithgow plays the devious prince who sends Shrek on the quest to save the princesses.  For some reason John Lithgow seems to have an amazing and talented voice.  All in all I enjoyed the film and would give it about a 7.  If you liked the movie I would suggest watching There&#39;s Something About Mary, Wayne&#39;s World, and Austin Powers."

Angry, Shrek travels to Duloc with a talkative Donkey (who escaped the crowd) to confront Lord Farquaad and demand the creatures be returned. In Duloc Farquaad, seeking to become king, consults a magic mirror that points him to Princess Fiona as the bride he must marry. During a tournament to determine who will attempt Fiona's rescue from a lava-surrounded castle, Shrek defeats the competitors (with Donkey's help) and Farquaad strikes a bargain: Shrek will rescue Fiona in exchange for the return of his swamp. Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle; Donkey wins over the female Dragon and is kept safe in her chambers, while Shrek finds Fiona in the tower. Fiona is initially pleased but disappointed when she sees Shrek is an ogre. They escape when Dragon, angered by Donkey's removal, chases them out. On the journey back to Duloc, Shrek and Fiona grow closer and begin to fall in love. At night Fiona refuses to sleep near them; when Donkey investigates one night he discovers Fiona transforms into an ogress in a windmill. Fiona explains privately to Donkey that she is cursed: by day she is human, by night she becomes an ogress, and only a true love's kiss will break the spell. She makes Donkey promise not to tell Shrek. Shrek overhears part of Fiona's apology about her \"ugly beast\" form and, misunderstanding that she means him, withdraws in hurt. The next morning Shrek takes Fiona to Duloc and hands her over to Farquaad; he then returns to his now-cleared swamp and angrily severs his friendship with Donkey. Donkey, who kept Fiona's confidence, eventually convinces Shrek that Fiona's words were about herself, not Shrek, and that Fiona will soon marry Farquaad. Donkey and Shrek race to Duloc with Dragon (who fell for Donkey and followed them) and crash Fiona and Farquaad's wedding. As the sun sets before Farquaad can kiss Fiona, she transforms into an ogress in front of the crowd. Farquaad orders Shrek killed and imprisons Fiona; Shrek summons Dragon, who bursts into the wedding, eats Farquaad, and destroys Duloc's authority. Shrek and Fiona confess their love and kiss; the spell's light appears but Fiona remains an ogress—her \"true form\" turned out to be ogresshood. They realize they love each other as they are. The film ends with Shrek and Fiona's wedding in the swamp and a celebratory reception with Donkey and the fairy-tale creatures; Shrek and Fiona depart on their honeymoon.",

      "shrek, a grouchy, mean, selfish yet insecure green ogre that has always enjoyed living in peaceful solitude in his swamp, finds his life disrupted when numerous fairy-tale beings, including pinocchio, the three little pigs, and donkey, are forced into the swamp by order of the obsessive, perfectionist, fairy-tale despising lord farquaad. shrek leaves the swamp to ask farquaad for the return of his privacy, with his new friend donkey happily tagging along. meanwhile, farquaad tortures the gingerbread man into revealing the whereabouts of the remaining fairy-tale creatures until his guards rush in with an object farquaad has been searching for: the magic mirror. the mirror tells him that farquaad can only become a real king by marrying a princess (completely disregarding his original question regarding if his kingdom was the fairest of them all). the mirror gives him three princesses to choose from (in a parody of the dating game): cinderella, snow white, and princess fiona. farquaad chooses fiona and silences the mirror before he can mention \"the little thing that happens at night\" (which is later revealed to be a curse). shrek and donkey arrive at farquaad's palace in duloc, where they find themselves in the midst of a tournament. the winner will have the \"privilege\" of attempting to rescue fiona from a castle surrounded by lava and protected by a fire-breathing dragon so that farquaad may marry her. shrek (with some help from donkey) easily beats the other knights in a fashion that resembles a wrestling match and farquaad agrees to remove the fairy-tale creatures from the swamp if shrek rescues fiona. shrek and donkey travel to the castle and split up to find fiona. donkey encounters the dragon and sweet-talks the beast to save himself before discovering that the dragon is female. dragon takes a liking to donkey and carries him to her chambers. when shrek finds fiona, she is appalled at his lack of romanticism. as they are leaving, shrek manages to save donkey, caught in dragon's tender clutches, and causing her to become irate, chasing shrek, fiona, and donkey out of the castle. at first, fiona is thrilled to be rescued but quickly becomes disappointed when shrek takes his helmet off and she realizes that he is an ogre. the three make their return journey to farquaad's palace, with shrek and fiona finding that they have more in common with each other along the way and falling in love. however, at night, fiona refuses to camp with them, taking shelter in a nearby cave until morning. shrek and donkey stay awake and watch the stars while shrek informs donkey that he plans to build a 10-foot wall around his swamp when he returns. when donkey persistently asks shrek why he is doing this, shrek sadly confesses to him that everyone judges him before they get to know him. therefore, he feels he is better off alone, despite donkey's admittance that he did not immediately judge him when they first met. fiona hears this and decides to be kinder to shrek the next day. the next night, fiona takes shelter in a nearby windmill. when donkey hears strange noises coming from the windmill, he finds fiona has turned into an ogress. fiona explains she was cursed as a child and turns into an ogress every night, which is why she was locked away in the castle, and that only a kiss from her true love will return her to her \"love's true form\". shrek, about to confess his feelings for fiona, overhears part of their conversation, and is heartbroken as he misinterprets her disgust at her transformation into an \"ugly beast\" as being disgusted with him. fiona makes donkey promise not to tell shrek about the spell, vowing to do it herself, but when the next morning comes, shrek has brought lord farquaad to fiona. the two return to the castle, while a hurt shrek returns to the now-vacated swamp, not long after breaking off his friendship with donkey, out of anger. shrek finds that, despite his privacy, he is miserable and misses fiona. donkey comes to the swamp, angry at shrek and shrek reveals that he overheard their conversation. donkey keeps his promise to fiona and tells shrek that she was talking about someone else. he then tells him that fiona will be getting married shortly, urging shrek into action to gain fiona's true love. they are able to travel to duloc quickly, thanks to dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed donkey. they interrupt the wedding before farquaad can kiss fiona, but not before the sun sets, which causes fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. while her transformation causes shrek to fully understand what he overheard at the windmill, farquaad, disgusted over the change, orders shrek killed and fiona imprisoned, but shrek whistles for dragon, who bursts in and devours farquaad. shrek and fiona admit their love for each other and share a kiss; fiona is bathed in light as her curse is broken but is surprised to find that she has remained an ogress, as she thought she was supposed to become beautiful, to which shrek replies that she is beautiful.\nthe two of them get married in the swamp and depart on their honeymoon while the rest celebrate by singing \"i'm a believer\"."

The story is based on Phyllis McGinley&#39;s 1956 book of the same name, illustrated by Kurt Werth. It was originally broadcast on December 10, 1974 on ABC.<br/><br/>This could be a sequel to &quot;Santa Claus is Coming To Town&quot; and it is in a spiritual way. Their is however isn&#39;t. The animation is different and the elves in this special are not the same elves we see in &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot;. It is however produced by the same company (Rankin/Bass) and Mickey Rooney voices &quot;Santa&quot; in this special as well.<br/><br/>Now in this film &quot;Santa&quot; decides to not deliver presents this year because he sees that people no longer have &quot;Christmas Spirit&quot; and no longer believe in Santa.<br/><br/>In an effort to save Christmas Mrs. Claus dispatches two elves out into the world to prove to Santa wrong. <br/><br/>Now this special has the now classic songs from &quot;The Heatmiser&quot; and &quot;Mr Snow&quot;. There is however 2 other songs that should of been cut or re-worked. Then again that is just my opinion <br/><br/>This special is a true classic. To call it &quot;One of the crown jewels of Holiday Programming&quot; would not do it justice. It is one of the finest programs ever produced for TV. <br/><br/>This special really gained a huge following once it hit Home Video. ABC held the rights for TV broadcast for years but seldom aired the special. After it became obvious that this special was loved by millions ABC began running it again on &quot;ABC FAMILY&quot; and the &quot;ABC Network&quot;. The same thing happened with &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot; that special was also returned to the ABC Network because of its huge following. That special was syndicated for years. ABC has now re- gained broadcasting rights."

Mrs. Claus (voiced by Shirley Booth) decides it&#39;s up to her to prove to Santa how much everyone still loves and admires him, so she sends off two elves on an around-the-world fact-finding mission to compile evidence of a belief in Santa and what he stands for. From there, the plot goes all over the place and nothing makes a whole lot of sense, but it&#39;s all harmless enough. The film&#39;s biggest selling point, of course, are the miser brothers, Heat and Snow, who each get a showstopping burlesque number complete with mini back up singers.

I have this on DVD now and plan to collect all the Rankin Bass Specials in addition to the Charlie Brown Holiday specials.<br/><br/>A Year Without a Santa Claus is just great.  You can&#39;t beat it in my opinion.  I agree with all the other comments that the Miser Brothers are the highlight of the special and should be mentioned whenever this special is marketed.  But unlike some of the other comments, I liked the ENTIRE story.  Another person who commented, Oldra, seems to hit the nail on the head about the song &quot;So You Don&#39;t Believe in Santa Claus&quot;.  Call me silly, but my eyes get just a &quot;little wet&quot; whenever Ignatious&#39;s Father and Mr. &quot;Clouse&quot; start singing to him about the existence of Santa Claus.  Even though in real life, a man does not come down chimneys in a red suit to deliver presents, the symbolism of what Santa stands for what the song is trying to convey-and it does a very good job in my opinion!!! To quote the song, &quot;Just believe in Santa Claus, like you believe in Love, and just believe in Santa Claus, and everything he does&quot;.  Happy Holidays and beyond!"

The Year Without A Santa Claus is almost as good as them and definitely one of the better Rankin/Bass Christmas specials. The stop-motion animation is wonderful, very detailed and both enchanting and atmospheric. I also loved the music, the score is whimsical with some lovely themes that never take away from the story or the festive feel of Christmas. The songs are sweet and catchy, I happen to think that they are memorable too. The Miser Brothers songs are a lot of fun as is Blue Christmas, and I also want to give a shout out to I Believe in Santa Claus, which I have always found very touching with a beautiful and truthful meaning without beating the audience around the head with it. The writing is amusing with the Miser Brothers, and there is evidence of conflict and pathos, and the story while bizarre in places has a lovely subtly handled message and gets you into the Christmas spirit. The characters I also like very much. The Miser Brothers definitely steal the show, especially Heat, but I do also enjoy Mrs Claus&#39; wit and sarcasm, Vixen&#39;s cuteness and Santa&#39;s benevolence. The voice acting is terrific. Overall, a lovely special that brings me great joy every time, when something gives you that feeling you know it&#39;s done something right. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

They&#39;re both stop-action cartoons by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, and both feature Mickey Rooney as the voice of Santa Claus, but they both shine in different aspects.<br/><br/>In this one, Shirley Booth stars as Mrs. Claus, and she and Mickey are the perfect choices to voice the North Pole couple. Mickey is loving, humorous, jolly, and just tired-sounding enough to sound like he keeps busy throughout the year. Shirley is hilarious and sweet, and while I&#39;ve always thought it a little weird for Santa Claus to be married, I couldn&#39;t have imagined a better, more fitting sounding wife than Shirley Booth. Dick Shawn, George S. Irving, Colin Duffy, Bob McFadden, and Bradley Bolke join the unforgettable cast, providing an endless supply of accents and deliveries to mimic. I can&#39;t count how many household phrases my family has acquired because of this delightful animated Christmas classic.<br/><br/>The jokes in William Keenan&#39;s script aren&#39;t just for kids. Some jokes are very fast-paced and might not be understood by the little ones, some poke fun at politics or issues kids won&#39;t yet understand, and some are geared for the kids but are so hilarious even the poutiest grown-up in the audience will burst out laughing. It&#39;s just delightful. Every year, my family and I curl up on the couch and look forward to Shirley Booth&#39;s adorable lilting, &quot;Do you think you should, with your cold and all?&quot;, Mickey Rooney&#39;s sad, tired, famous line, &quot;I dreamed unhappy things!&quot;, the toe-tapping Heat Miser and Cold Miser scenes, and the &quot;I Believe in Santa Claus&quot; song when everyone, young and old, even though we&#39;ve watched it every year for thirty years, sheds a tear."

There&#39;s a touching rendition of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; by a child writing a letter to Santa, but the other characters&#39; reactions to Santa&#39;s decision seem too mild to generate real drama.  Most of the other songs are pleasant but unmemorable. The plot&#39;s resolution is too contrived to be affecting.<br/><br/>The two real reasons for THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS&#39;s popularity are Snow Miser and Heat Miser.  They are minor characters with limited onscreen time, but they blow away the other characters.  Those quarreling siblings provide the special with some much needed brio. As the voice of Snow Miser, Dick Shawn oozes with self-satisfied smarm.  Yet he conveys such gleeful humor in his delivery that his oiliness endears viewers. As the voice of Heat Miser, George S. Irving is hilariously irascible, an overgrown brat who fumes over everything associated with snow.  It is this very childishness that makes Heat Miser so amusing.  Of course, their musical numbers stop the show not because of their lyrics, which are repetitive, but their snappy deliveries.  <br/><br/>The Miser brothers are so delightful that their absence creates a void in THE YEAR WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.  One wishes that Rankin Bass, which produced this special, had produced a special focusing on them.  It is too late now, at least with the voice of Dick Shawn, who has long passed on.  One can still appreciate the fact these characters were devised at all.  Without them, THE YEAR WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS would probably be forgotten by now."

The Miser Brothers are great, its extremely charming, and I&#39;d argue the best animation out of the Rankin/Bass specials. If you love Christmas and the Rankin/Bass specials, like me, then I&#39;d request to give this a watch."

She sends elves Jingle and Jangle with reindeer Vixen to find Christmas cheers and goodwill. Santa follows them into town. Ignatius &quot;Iggy&quot; Thistlewhite is a young boy. Like the rest of the kids, he doesn&#39;t believe in Santa Claus anymore. Mrs. Claus negotiates an agreement between Snow Miser and Heat Miser to bring snow to South Town and revive the Christmas spirit.<br/><br/>This Christmas special follows Santa Claus Is Comin&#39; to Town and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. It introduces great new characters Snow Miser and Heat Miser. The other characters are less compelling by comparison. This adds to the established tradition of the stop-motion animated Christmas specials."

        "text": "Santa Claus (robustly voiced by the ever-exuberant Mickey Rooney) gets a bad cold and decides to take a year off. Ms. Claus (given an endearingly warm voice by Shirley Booth) sends bumbling elves Jingle Bells and Jangle Bells along with baby reindeer Vixen to go out into the world to find plenty of holiday cheer in order to persuade Santa to go ahead with his usual routine. Meanwhile, the constantly feuding Miser Brothers further muck things up. This delightful Noel family musical television program from Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr., the same fine folks who gave us such sparkling gems as &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Frosty the Snowman,&quot; offers a winning mix of good-natured humor and several highly catchy songs. However, it&#39;s the marvelously campy antics of the Miser Brothers who make this show a prime piece of hilarious entertainment: George S. Irving is deliciously manic as the cantankerous overgrown brat Heat Miser while Dick Shawn is camp perfection as the smarmy hambone Snow Miser; their scenes are a complete sidesplitting joy to watch and the jaunty burlesque songs they both heartily belt out are simply awesome. Rhoda Mann likewise impresses as the folksy matronly voice of Mother Nature. The funky stop-motion animation and the light, upbeat tone further enhance the overall merry charm of this lovely little beaut."

      "plot_summary": "At the North Pole, Santa Claus catches a severe cold; Dr. Flammer diagnoses him and advises he stay home, saying public belief in Santa is waning. Discouraged, Santa announces he will cancel Christmas and take a holiday. Mrs. Claus refuses to accept this and considers delivering gifts herself. She recruits two elves, Jingle and Jangle Bells, to find proof that people still care about Santa. The elves take Vixen and head to Southtown, USA, where it never snows and where they hope to find Christmas spirit. Santa, suspicious that Mrs. Claus has sent the elves, follows on Dasher. On the way south, Jingle and Jangle are intercepted by the Miser brothers: Snow Miser and Heat Miser. Vixen escapes with the elves. In Southtown the elves are stopped by a policeman, ticketed for riding a reindeer on a one-way street and for their attire; they disguise Vixen by covering her antlers, but a cat chases them and they climb a tree. The dogcatcher takes Vixen to the pound. The elves talk with several local children who claim they no longer need Santa and regard belief as childish. Santa, traveling incognito, meets Ignatius 'Iggy' Thistlewhite and, posing under a false name, learns that Iggy's family and his father do believe in Santa. Iggy helps Santa and the elves by locating Vixen in the pound; when they go to the mayor to demand her release the mayor refuses unless they can make it snow in Southtown. Santa rescues a sick Vixen from the pound and returns her to the North Pole on Dasher. Back at the North Pole, Mrs. Claus, the elves and Blitzen go to ask Snow Miser to make it snow in Southtown. Snow Miser says he lacks authority because Heat Miser controls Southtown; they confront Heat Miser, who refuses because of a grudge against Santa and demands control of the North Pole in exchange. Mrs. Claus threatens to appeal to the misers' mother, Mother Nature. Mother Nature summons both brothers and brokers a compromise: Snow Miser will give Southtown a snowstorm in exchange for one spring day at the North Pole. With the promise secured, Santa nurses Vixen back to health, places her in his bed, and falls asleep in his chair, still unconvinced. The mayor of Southtown wakes to find snow falling; the town and children worldwide react by declaring a holiday for Santa and sending him gifts and letters. A little girl's letter saying she'll have a 'blue Christmas' without him finally convinces Santa that people still care; he recovers his faith and decides to make his Christmas Eve deliveries after all.",

      "santa claus comes down sick, and the doctor tells him he needs to stay home and not deliver presents this year. when santa protests, the doctor says that no one even believes in him any more and it doesn't matter. over mrs. claus' objections, santa decides to cancel christmas. mrs. claus considers putting on the red suit and delivering the presents herself, and calls two elves, jingle and jangle bells, to help her. the elves don't see mrs. claus as a convincing replacement, and they move to plan b: finding someone in the world who really cares about santa. jingle and jangle take vixen and head south. santa accuses mrs. claus of being up to something, and she confesses to sending jingle and jangle on their errand. santa, worried that they will not complete their mission, follows them on dasher. before he can reach them, jingle and jangle run into the miser brothers, snow miser and heat miser. vixen is able to escape with the elves safely. when they reach town, they are pulled over by a policeman, who writes them a ticket for riding a vixen the wrong way on a one way street and wearing funny-looking suits on a sunday. they disguise vixen as a dog by putting socks over her antlers, but a cat chases her and the elves up a tree. meanwhile, santa interviews the policeman, who is lacking in christmas spirit. the elves discuss christmas with some children, who all claim they don't care if santa comes or not, and \"believing in santa claus is for little kids.\" they don't notice the dogcatcher taking vixen away. later, ignatius thistlewhite, one of the children, is found by santa. using a false name, he visits the thistlewhite home and mrs. thistlewhite gives him a hot drink to help with his sneezing. ignatius (iggy) asks if his father or santa believe in santa claus, and they both respond in the affirmative. iggy tells them that the elves' \"dog\" had been taken by the dog catcher, and santa rushes to save her. both iggy and the elves resolve to visit the mayor to get vixen back, but when the three of them meet with the mayor, he is disbelieving. he then proposes a bargain: if they can make it snow in southtown, he'll release vixen and give santa a national holiday. santa gets a very sick vixen released from the pound, and dasher takes them both home to the cool air of the north pole. the elves meet mrs. claus and blitzen on a rooftop and they all go to visit snow miser to see if he would be willing to make it snow in southtown. snow miser explains that southtown is under the control of his brother heat miser and without his permission he can't do anything, so off they go to heat miser. heat miser has a grudge against santa due to santa's prejudice against warm weather, and refuses to allow the snow unless snow miser is willing to turn over control of the north pole. they call snow miser on the hot line, but the brothers refuse to bargain. mrs. claus makes an ultimatum: if they cannot come to an agreement, she will go to see the miser brothers' mother, mother nature. mother nature calls the brothers to her and brokers a compromise: one spring day at the north pole in exchange for a snowstorm in southtown. santa brings vixen back to the north pole and puts her in his own bed. he falls asleep in his chair. the mayor of southtown gets a call from his wife reminding him to wear his galoshes - snow is falling in southtown. children around the world decide that not only are they giving santa a holiday, but they will send him presents as well. if they don't have anything to send, they write letters. one such letter from a little girl tells santa that she'll have a blue christmas without him. finally convinced that goodness still exists in the world, santa decides that he will deliver the presents after all."

I think everything about this movie is perfect: the visuals, the action, the dialogue, the costumes, the acting... it was both beautiful and apocalyptic. I loved how everything felt like a rock &#39;n&#39; roll fest.<br/><br/>I love dystopian movies, but you don&#39;t have to be a fan to recognize how amazing this was. It&#39;s a story of survival in a savage wasteland, every scene felt epic. I liked the cult-like nature and how they glorified their deaths like they were Vikings. Everything was eccentric and crazy, with non-stop action for nearly the whole movie.<br/><br/>It&#39;s really dystopian and wild, so it&#39;s surprising that this was actually a mainstream hit. &quot;Do not become addicted to water&quot; was such a wild statement, lol.<br/><br/>The premise is very simple; I don&#39;t think I can think of a more simplistic movie that worked so well. They drive out into the desert, then make a U-turn back to where they came from. That&#39;s it. And it&#39;s a blast. This is my favorite action movie, jam-packed with crazy sequences.<br/><br/>The movie is really just one huge dystopian action sequence, so I guess the drawback could be that it&#39;s all action. If you&#39;re looking for something more, you won&#39;t find much. Apparently, Mad Max lore has some complex and darker elements, and maybe the upcoming Furiosa will delve deeper into that.<br/><br/>Furiosa was probably the main character; it felt like Mad Max himself was just tagging along. The villain, Immortan Joe, was great. All the characters are memorable. And because the premise is so simple and the movie is so action-packed, it feels shorter than it actually is. It&#39;s just great fun and keeps me glued to the screen. Looking forward to Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga."

Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80&#39;s action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There&#39;s no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It&#39;s not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron&#39;s character. I didn&#39;t think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn&#39;t terrible. He just didn&#39;t lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.<br/><br/>Special mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you like Mad Max!"

The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it&#39;s plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don&#39;t mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn&#39;t like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much."

        "summary": "Pure action spectacle",
        "text": "MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I&#39;ve watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it&#39;s a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.<br/><br/>I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there&#39;s little else to get in the way. It&#39;s one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that&#39;s never been done before.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that&#39;s not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it&#39;s pretty much my idea of a perfect film."

        "text": "George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. &#39;Mad Max: Fury Road&#39; is ridiculous in all the right ways.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you&#39;ll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young &#39;&quot;wives&quot; escape from the film&#39;s antagonist.<br/><br/>Leading up to the film&#39;s release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron&#39;s character. Is the story something we haven&#39;t seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it&#39;s nice to see a solid narrative.<br/><br/>Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character&#39;s make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It&#39;s motivated. And it&#39;s glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.<br/><br/>&#39;Mad Max: Fury Road&#39; has set a new standard for action films. It&#39;s arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It&#39;s that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80&#39;s action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It&#39;s the best time I&#39;ve had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn&#39;t help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face."

        "text": "Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller&#39;s attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.<br/><br/>Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy&#39;s talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron&#39;s Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. <br/><br/>Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I&#39;m happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I&#39;m calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it&#39;s chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it&#39;s one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.<br/><br/>There&#39;s a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition."

        "text": "The rationale behind the success of &#39;Fury Road&#39; predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he&#39;s been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it&#39;s pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there&#39;s not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, &#39;Fury Road&#39; is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design."

        "text": "When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what&#39;s your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn&#39;t interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. <br/><br/>At least it wasn&#39;t so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. <br/><br/>I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller&#39;s masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn&#39;t I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn&#39;t even noticed that we don&#39;t have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. <br/><br/>NOTE: &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time if you have seen the original.&quot; from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.<br/><br/>10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise."

        "text": "Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller&#39;s return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn&#39;t have much of a plot at all but seriously you&#39;re not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn&#39;t even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don&#39;t, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. <br/><br/>The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn&#39;t anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. <br/><br/>I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn&#39;t slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we&#39;re always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10"

        "text": "Rewatching this before Furiosa felt like a cornucopia of action, eye candy and quite simply, madness. It&#39;s a film that has a simple plot and premise but is heavy on pretty much everything else from dedicated actors sinking into the madly written lines and plot, gorgeous cinematography, an excellent audio score and the excellent use of practical effects. Seriously it uses such a blend of practical effects within special effects that compliment each other so well you start to believe they&#39;re actually in these crazy chase sequences including a ridiculous one through a live sand storm that was wicked to watch unfold. My only complaints would be it could have used a little more complex plot and Max himself could have been in the movie more as a protagonist instead of feeling like a supporting character in a movie with his name in the title. Other than that it&#39;s a wild ride from start to finish with almost near non stop action to keep you invested until the climactic, while partially abrupt, finish."

      "plot_summary": "After civilization collapses into a desert wasteland, Max Rockatansky is captured by Immortan Joe's War Boys and taken to the Citadel, where his hair is shaved and vital information is tattooed on his back. Designated a \"universal blood donor,\" Max is chained and used to transfuse blood to a sick War Boy named Nux. Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's lieutenants with a mechanical arm, drives the armored War Rig out to barter with nearby allies (the Bullet Farm and Gas Town). Unbeknownst to most of Joe's men, Furiosa has loaded Joe's five breeding wives (Capable, Cheedo, Toast, The Dag, and Angharad) into the rig and escapes toward a childhood haven she calls the Green Place. When Joe notices his wives missing he launches a massive pursuit, calling up all forces including the War Boys led by his sons Rictus Erectus and the zealot Immortan Joe himself; Nux straps Max to his vehicle so Max accompanies the chase as a living blood bag.\nFuriosa's crew fights multiple chases: first against Buzzards who attack in hostile territory, then into a sandstorm that separates pursuers. Nux tries to sacrifice himself to destroy the rig during the storm; Max frees himself, subdues Nux and, after the storm, finds Furiosa repairing the War Rig with the five wives. Max initially steals the rig but cannot fully control it and stays with the group. Nux sneaks aboard later; after the wives overpower him, he is captured by Joe's forces but later rescued emotionally by Capable and re-joins the fugitives.\nThey attempt to reach the Green Place but are intercepted by a biker clan in a canyon; the bikers try to block Joe with detonations. Joe forces his way through with a massive vehicle, and during the ensuing confrontation Angharad—heavily pregnant and Joe's favorite—falls, is crushed by Joe's car, and dies with her unborn child. Furiosa reveals the Green Place was a childhood memory; later, the group crosses swampland and encounters an older woman who summons Furiosa's clan, the Vuvalini. The Vuvalini confirm that the marshes they passed were the Green Place but it has been devastated and is no longer viable.\nRecognizing that the Citadel—Joe's fortress—holds the only real chance for a sustainable life because it contains water and greenery Joe hoards, Furiosa and Max (haunted by guilt over losing a wife and child) decide to turn back and take the Citadel from Joe. They plan to lure Joe's army into the canyon trap set by the bikers. On the return run they are attacked; Furiosa is seriously wounded. On the canyon approach Joe positions his vehicle to block the War Rig. Rictus and his men battle Max while Joe pursues Furiosa. Toast distracts Joe and manages to remove his breathing apparatus; Furiosa rips the mask off, killing Immortan Joe. Nux, seeking redemption, sacrifices himself by ramming his vehicle into the enemy and wrecking the pursuing cars, killing Rictus and blocking Joe's forces, which allows Furiosa, Max, the wives, and the Vuvalini to escape driving Joe's armored car.\nFuriosa is gravely injured and Max gives blood to transfuse into her so she survives. They return to the Citadel; the starving populace cheers when Joe's corpse is revealed and his regime collapses. Furiosa, the five wives (those still alive), and the Vuvalini ride onto the Citadel's platforms and are accepted by the people and even some War Boys. Max, having helped secure their future, quietly slips away into the crowd after sharing a final look with Furiosa.",

      "following a nuclear holocaust, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. max rockatansky (tom hardy), a survivor, is captured by the war boys, the army of the tyrannical immortan joe (hugh keays-byrne) and taken to joe's citadel. max is haunted by nightmares of a woman and a child that he failed to protect. at the citadel, max's hair is shaved, and his vital information is tattooed on his back. max tries to escape but realizes that he is being inside a cave system of a stump like mountain with sheer drops to the surface on all sides. designated a universal blood donor, max is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for a sick war boy called nux (nicholas hoult).\nmeanwhile, imperator furiosa (charlize theron), one of joe's lieutenants with one artificial arm, is sent in her armored truck to trade produce and water for petrol and ammunition with two of his allies, the bullet farmer (richard carter) and the people eater (john howard) ruler of gas town.\njoe is an old man, who has blisters all over his body. he requires a special suit to protect his body and an oxygen mask that allows him to breathe. joe rules the population with an iron fist and controls them with limited release of water for consumption at periodic intervals. the water is stored in the mountain stump, and released for a few moments on orders of joe, for the teeming masses living below. when furiosa drives off-route, joe realizes that his five wives-women selected for breeding-are missing. joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farm. nux joins the pursuit with max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. meanwhile, furiosa's rig is attacked by buzzards in hostile territory. her own escort, who is not aware that furiosa has betrayed joe, helps her fight off the buzzards, but that's when joe and his forces catch up with furiosa.\na battle ensues between the truck and joe's forces. furiosa drives into a sandstorm, evading her pursuers, except nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the truck. max escapes and restrains nux, but the car is destroyed. after the storm, max sees furiosa repairing her truck, accompanied by the wives: capable (riley keough) the most level-headed and mature of the five, cheedo the fragile (courtney eaton) the meekest and most timid, toast the knowing (zoe kravitz) the most practical and intellectual of the five and is shown to have good knowledge of guns, the dag (abbey lee) an eccentric and bold personality, and the splendid angharad (rosie huntington-whiteley) joe's most \"treasured\" breeder, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with joe's child. max steals the truck, but its kill switch disables it. max begrudgingly agrees to help furiosa's group escape joe's wrath. nux sneaks onto the rig and attempts to kill furiosa, but the women overpower him and throw him out. nux who was left behind, is picked up by joe's army. furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon to barter a deal for safe passage. however, with joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block joe. joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the rig. he sends nux to carjack the rig.\nmax and furiosa fight pursuing bikers as joe's car, with nux now on board, surmounts the blockade and eventually attacks furiosa's truck, allowing nux to board. however, as the truck escapes, angharad falls off in an attempt to protect max and is run over by joe's car, mortally wounding her and her child. furiosa explains to max that they are escaping to the \"green place\", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. capable finds nux hiding in the truck, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. that night, the truck gets stuck in mud. furiosa and max slow joe's forces with mines, but joe's ally, the bullet farmer (richard carter), continues pursuing them. nux helps max free the truck while furiosa shoots and blinds the bullet farmer. max walks into the dark to confront the bullet farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition. moved by capable's compassion, nux joins the group and helps get the rig moving again. they drive the truck overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. max suspects a trap, but furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. the naked woman summons her clan, the vuvalini, who recognize furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the green place, now inhospitable. the vulvalini include the valkyrie (megan gale), the keeper of the seeds (melissa jaffer) and others (melita jurisic, gillian jones, joy smithers, antoinette kellerman, and christina koch). the group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended citadel, which has ample water and greenery that joe keeps for himself, and trap joe and his army in the bikers' canyon. the group heads back to the citadel, but they are attacked on route by joe's forces, and furiosa is seriously wounded. joe positions his car in front of the truck to slow it, while max fights joe's giant son, rictus erectus (nathan jones). joe captures toast, but she distracts him long enough for furiosa to rip off his breathing mask, killing him. nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the truck, killing rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing max, furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini to successfully escape in joe's car, where max transfuses his blood to furiosa to help her survive her injuries. at the citadel, the impoverished citizens are overjoyed at the sight of joe's corpse. furiosa, the wives, and the vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the war boys, but max walks away, sharing a glance with furiosa before disappearing into the crowd."

Indy himself is one of the most famous characters in American cinema, fitting the profile of the classic action hero, but with several peculiarities that make him special, from his acid sense of humor, his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence. All villains are purposefully shallow and Manichean, with Nazism incorporating all the evil on Earth in a cartoonish way, but that never sounds strange in this proposal.<br/><br/>In &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, Spielberg makes his first openly action movie, even though &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;1941&quot; had their setpieces there, here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish, and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert. The opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe, with Spielberg&#39;s camera keeping a mystery about Indy&#39;s identity - Douglas Slocombe&#39;s photograph skillfully covers Ford&#39;s face with shadows - but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills; see the closed planes of the hat, the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker. It is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmaker&#39;s camera game, which is maintained throughout the film&#39;s other numerous action sequences. Between shootings in bars, races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip, what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and good-natured adventure. is one of the great strengths of the feature, guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm, while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle, as in a real board game. Spielberg&#39;s ability to command the action is present in the most &quot;naive&quot; scenes, such as the snake pit or the fight in the Nazi plane, even in the most elaborate ones, such as the chase of trucks involving Jones and several soldiers.<br/><br/>Classic backstage story, it was Harrison Ford&#39;s suggestion that Indy, when faced by a skilled swordsman in the Cairo market, simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip - as the script originally said. A sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that Ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food, and that perfectly ended up defining one of Indy&#39;s personality traits. Throughout two other action scenes, the hero &quot;asks&quot; an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight, and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is: &quot;I don&#39;t know, I invent on the way&quot;. Priceless phrases and actions, and that only Harrison Ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness, in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career. Ford is loose, unlike what he commonly complained of Han Solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero. He is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact, in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh, besides of course to reproduce the cliché of forbidden love for someone of the past, In this case, Marion, the strong and feminine character of Karen Allen, a woman who is clearly not a full-time damsel in distress.<br/><br/>With special care for the action, what is also striking is how Spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes. For example, the scene where Indy and Brody (Denholm Elliott) are approached by government officials, and the archaeologist explains the Ark of the Covenant myth to them, Spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there, well-disposed through a mise en scène that puts the agents - and the spectator - in a classroom, where Indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future; an exhibition that does not sound forced, after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher. We also see Spielberg&#39;s brand developing, where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters&#39; positions and the graceful movement of the camera, giving the strong impression that a cut has happened, but remaining in the same shot. Iconography is also a factor that Spielberg and Slocombe masterfully explore, as in the scene where Indy visits Marion in her bar, casting a giant shadow on the girl, but being Marion a fearless woman - and the most memorable one in the archaeologist&#39;s gallery - she is very capable of opposing the presence of Indy, and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversation.<br/><br/>The master of Star Wars songs, conductor John Williams had already been working with Spielberg since &quot;Jaws&quot;, and not tired of delivering memorable themes, he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the Indiana Jones musical piece. It is a cheerful, adventurous and even flashy theme, which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise, as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks, such as the love theme with Marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the Nazis. Another work of genius, for a change.<br/><br/>Being an example of the 80s, and literally beginning the decade, the overwhelming majority of the special effects of Hunters are done in a practical way, being done in the studio, unlike the digital effects so common today. It is very good that Spielberg did not like his friend George Lucas who adapted the effects of Star Wars for the &quot;current times&quot; which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made. The snake scene was made with real snakes (and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor. The giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball, and the scene where Indiana Jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way, with some stuntmen obviously, but Harrison Ford himself was dragged by the car at one point. We have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen, while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror. Anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of Nazis having their faces twisted, exploded and melted when the Ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power, and Spielberg and his team have fun here. Okay, the matte paintings and projections of the &quot;spirits&quot; of the Ark are images that today appear considerably dated, but still have an impact, as well as the wonderful eighth of the Nazi Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) literally melting before our eyes.<br/><br/>One of the great films of Spielberg&#39;s career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time. The film, despite being a big blockbuster, still has personal traits of the director who is Jewish, so don&#39;t think that the Nazis are villains by chance. Spielberg prints in Caçadores gains a strong and constant critical sub-text that enriches the cinematographic experience, combining narrative lightness with very strong &quot;strikes&quot; against the most murderous regime of the 20th century. It is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing it.<br/><br/>&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; borders on perfection, as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries, while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars, and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits, where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept, all waiting to star in one or more adventures of Indiana and yours.<br/><br/>With all these elements well balanced - including a predilection for fantasy - &quot;The Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history, competing for eight Oscars and taking four, starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations. We witnessed a perfect adventure film here, being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen. Indiana Jones is already born an iconic figure, thanks to the good ideas of George Lucas and the technical virtuosity of Steven Spielberg, who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way, using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new."

In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Of course the story isn&#39;t waterproof, the Nazi weren&#39;t that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. <br/><br/>Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930&#39;s they created their own legend. <br/><br/>It&#39;s funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?"

        "text": "It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o&#39;clock shadow looking like it&#39;s closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!<br/><br/>Whhhoooooo!! I&#39;m left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today&#39;s terms.<br/><br/>Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy&#39;s battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. &quot; Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. &quot; ( a battered and bloody Indy ) &quot; Truck? What truck?&quot; ( and then later ) &quot;Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar&#39;s. I&#39;m going after that truck. &quot;<br/><br/>Sola ) &quot; How? &quot; ( Indy ) I don&#39;t know I&#39;m making this up as I go.&quot;<br/><br/>Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven&#39;t seen this movie in a while or if you haven&#39;t seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.<br/><br/>TRUST ME"

        "text": "I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can&#39;t quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.<br/><br/>I think a part of that is down to the fact it&#39;s a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.<br/><br/>It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It&#39;s a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn&#39;t alive during those times.<br/><br/>The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn&#39;t lost the excitement factor. It&#39;s a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it&#39;s all there for a reason and that it belongs there.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I&#39;m inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that&#39;s a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.<br/><br/>There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it&#39;s a ripping adventure yarn, you don&#39;t need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi&#39;s, surely that&#39;s enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time."

        "text": "Original, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn&#39;t have had &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile,&quot; &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire&quot;, and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones&#39; leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn&#39;t get far.<br/><br/>The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, &quot;What do I do NOW, Ma?&quot; What you do is produce sequels: &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,&quot; &quot;Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,&quot; and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that&#39;s in the nature of decadence.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It&#39;s 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.<br/><br/>Here&#39;s the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.<br/><br/>But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn&#39;t of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That&#39;s de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren&#39;t just rebuilt. They&#39;re lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don&#39;t waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen&#39;s. I&#39;m not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they&#39;re meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.<br/><br/>Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed."

Indy escapes by seaplane piloted by Jock. Back in the U.S., Museum curator Marcus Brody briefs Indy on a German radio intercept: Nazis have located Tanis and seek the Ark of the Covenant, said to grant invincibility. Army intelligence wants Indy because his former teacher, Abner Ravenwood, owned the headpiece of the Staff of Ra that locates the Ark on a Sun map. Indy travels to Nepal and finds Marion Ravenwood, Abner’s daughter, who possesses the headpiece and blames Indy for her father's death. Marion reluctantly joins for money. Nazi agent Arnold Toht and German operatives attack the bar; a fight and fire damage the headpiece. Toht sears his hand on the red-hot piece; Indy retrieves it. The headpiece shows the Staff of Ra’s correct height when paired with a staff, but a shaman in Nepal reveals the Nazis have a wrong-length staff and are digging in the wrong place. Indy and Marion go to Egypt. In Cairo, Belloq works with Wehrmacht Colonel Dietrich and Nazi archaeologists to excavate at Tanis. Indy meets Sallah, his Egyptian ally. Marion is captured once, apparently killed in a truck explosion, but later revealed alive; she is repeatedly abused and used as leverage by the Nazis. Indy sneaks into the map room beneath an excavation and, using the correctly sized staff with the headpiece at the proper sun angle, locates the Well of Souls and the Ark’s true burial site. Indy digs, finds a chamber full of snakes, and with Sallah recovers the Ark chest. Belloq seduces Marion to keep her captive; she is later thrown into the Well of Souls chamber and rescued by Indy. The Ark is seized by Nazis and packed onto a truck; Indy intercepts and retakes it, then ships it aboard a U.S. transport. A Nazi U-boat captures the transport and transfers the Ark to a mountain island where an SS ceremony is planned. Indy and Marion stow aboard the Nazi convoy, but are captured; the Ark is opened during a ritual while Indy and Marion are tied to poles. Belloq insists the Ark will reveal God’s power; when the Ark is opened, supernatural entities emerge and vaporize the Nazi officers and soldiers—Belloq is killed as the Ark’s spirits tear him apart. Indy and Marion, who kept their eyes closed, survive. Weeks later, Army officers confiscate the Ark; Indy and Marcus argue with the military, and the Ark is placed in a sealed crate and stored anonymously in a vast government warehouse.",

      "it is 1936, indy (harrison ford) steals a statue from a south american temple hidden deep in the forest, dodging traps & colleagues who betray him but get killed themselves due to their lack of knowledge of ancient artifacts and the defenses designed to keep them safe. indy is able to navigate the defenses safely and get to the statue, but mistakenly activates a large boulder, when he fails to replace the correct weight of the statue on the mechanism. while escaping the boulder, indy is cornered by the hovitos, the local tribe, who are led by dr. rene belloq (paul freeman), an arrogant french archaeologist who is a longtime rival and enemy of indy's. indy has to give the statue to belloq.\nindy flees and is rescued by jock (fred sorenson), flying a seaplane. indy reckons belloq is taking it to marrakesh. marcus brody (denholm elliott) is indy's best friend and the curator of a museum back home and buys the antiques that indy rescues, for the museum. indy uses the funds to pay for his travel expenses across the world. the army officers meet indy & explain that a german radio cable from cairo to berlin says the nazis have discovered tanis, an ancient city buried in a gigantic sandstorm in 980 b.c. and the possible burial site of the ark of the covenant on which moses inscribed the ten commandments. it holds immense mystical power & can make nazi's invincible.\nthe officers explain that the cable mentioned indy's teacher professor ravenwood. indy believes that ravenwood has the staff of ra headpiece. the headpiece mounted on the staff at a certain place at a certain time, would point to the location of the ark in a special map room, with a miniature of the city on the floor. indy finds his ex-girlfriend marion (karen allen) in kathmandu, who has the headpiece that point to the location of the ark. karen is abner ravenwood's daughter. karen says that abner is dead.\nmarion is angry at indy for abandoning her but joins his quest for the ark for money (indy promises her $5000 for her help). they are followed by the nazi spy toht. toht and the nazi's attack marion to recover the headpiece. indy intervenes and a gunfight ensues which sets fire to the bar where marion works. the headpiece gets knocked around and falls in the fire. toht burns his hand when he tries to pick the red-hot headpiece. indy recovers the headpiece and toht has to retreat.\nindy & marion head to egypt to find belloq helping the nazis dig for the ark. the nazis capture marion and try to smuggle her out of cairo in a truck. indy fights the goons and shoots at the truck, which overturns and ends up in a fiery explosion, leading indy to believe that marion is dead. belloq meets a distraught indy (who thinks marion is killed) & boasts about finding the ark. belloq says that the ark is a medium to talk to god.\nindy goes to see a shaman who is reading the ra headpiece after both men have learned that belloq and his wehrmacht aide, colonel dietrich (wolf kahler), have obtained a copy of the headpiece from toht's burned hand.\nthe shaman reveals two critical facts: first, that the headpiece gives the precise height of the staff of ra, and second, that the staff the nazis used was too long (belloq got only one side of the inscriptions on the headpiece from toht's hand and hence didn't know that there were additional instructions on the back side as well) -- so their excavation is over a mile away from the ark's actual burial site, which is known as the well of souls.\nindy enters the map room himself and deduces the correct location of the ark. indy finds marion while hiding from the nazis. he leaves marion in the nazis possession (so as not to arouse suspicion) & then proceeds to dig in the actual site where the ark is buried. the dig reveals a chamber full of snakes. indy uses fire to carve a path inside the chamber.\nsallah (john rhys-davies) (indy's friend in egypt) follows and the two eventually find the gigantic chest that is the ark. meanwhile, marion seduces belloq and tries to escape nazi captivity. marion is again captured by toht. belloq then notices a team working in a portion of the city that he has not authorized and asks dietrich to gather his troops.\nthe nazi's throw marion into the chamber & set fire to it. indy follows the snakes in the chambers which leads to a german airfield. marion & indy escape by fighting off the nazis with a fighter plane.\nindy then hooks up with sallah to trace the ark which was being taken to cairo in a truck & takes it back from nazis after fighting off the armed escorts around the truck. indy takes it to us via ship, but a nazi submarine captures it back & takes it to the top of a mountain on an island. at an elaborate ceremony atop the mountain indy and marion, tied to a pole, can only watch as the ark is opened, but it contains nothing but sand, the remains of the stone tablets. no sooner is it opened, however, than its spirits suddenly appear. indy and marion, remembering an ancient code that requires people to close their eyes and not look at the now-freed spirits, withstand the mayhem that ensues as the energy of the ark surges forth and its spirits attack the now-terrified nazis, killing the entire contingent and destroying belloq in gruesome fashion. the energy mass surges high into the sky before returning to the ark and resealing it, leaving indy and marion drained but freed. weeks later indy and marcus feud with the army officers over the whereabouts of the ark, indy angry that the army has no idea what it has in the ark -- though it appears they in fact do understand what they have, as the ark is sealed in a large crate and stored anonymously in a gigantic government warehouse, never to be seen again."

        "text": "I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I&#39;m writing this movie comment this late is because I didn&#39;t wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can&#39;t stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it&#39;s hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman&#39;s skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson&#39;s performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like &quot;What are they, kidding?&quot;, once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I&#39;m not going to compare Jack and Heath&#39;s performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath&#39;s Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn&#39;t know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he&#39;s crazy, he&#39;s driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. <br/><br/>This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who&#39;s previous film, Batman Begins, didn&#39;t really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it&#39;s not real, people don&#39;t dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don&#39;t name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.<br/><br/>Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he&#39;s inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he&#39;s going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham&#39;s mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the &quot;Classy Villain that Gotham needs&quot;, he also has brought a new thought into Batman&#39;s head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham&#39;s &quot;White Knight&quot; trying to put all of Gotham&#39;s scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.<br/><br/>All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone&#39;s going crazy over Heath Ledger&#39;s performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath&#39;s and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don&#39;t wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can&#39;t come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I&#39;ve seen it twice in one weekend, I&#39;m going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don&#39;t mind one bit. I can&#39;t wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.<br/><br/>10/10"

        "summary": "Film surpasses the hype",
        "text": "We&#39;ve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We&#39;ve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.<br/><br/>Everything that&#39;s been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.<br/><br/>For as much action as there is in this movie, it&#39;s the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.<br/><br/>Bale&#39;s Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox&#39;s inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. <br/><br/>As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It&#39;s not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker&#39;s stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could&#39;ve pulled something like this off. That&#39;s how difficult of a role this was, and that&#39;s why Ledger&#39;s performance is so great.<br/><br/>This isn&#39;t an action movie. It&#39;s a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it&#39;s all in there."

The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we&#39;ll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale&#39;s Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."

I don&#39;t usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is certainly loud and violent but it&#39;s not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he&#39;s done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"

        "text": "I think that I could wax lyrical but this movie all day. It is absolutely incredible from start to finish.<br/><br/>This is the Batman trilogy&#39;s second outing. It&#39;s filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. The story is really good. The twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. There are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.<br/><br/>Because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the Batman and the Joker that really makes this movie what it is. It is all in the contrast between the two. Right against wrong. Chaos and anarchy versus order. The Joker is the perfect villain for Batman. Batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. The very essence of the idea of the Batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. He is the embodyment of what is right. The Joker challenges the very core and foundation of who Batman is and what he stands for. He is someone who doesn&#39;t follow any rules. He is pure chaos and anarchy personified. As he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: &quot;this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object&quot;. The Joker wants the Batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. The powerful thing is also that you can see why the Joker does what he does. In some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. It is truly an amazing battle. The brilliant acting from Heath Ledger is a major part of it too. He is absolutely incredible as the Joker. Rest in peace.<br/><br/>I could probably go on further about how great I think this movie is but I&#39;ll just say this. Just watch the movie. You should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don&#39;t wan&#39;t to do I still think you should see this movie. It is just great."

I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.<br/><br/>The movie could also have been called &quot;The Joker&quot;, but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"

      "plot_summary": "In Gotham City, mob banks are being targeted after Batman (Bruce Wayne) and Lt. James Gordon begin a campaign with new District Attorney Harvey Dent to dismantle organized crime. A gang robs a mob bank; only one survivor — a chaotic, scarred criminal calling himself the Joker — escapes with the money. The Joker (who later kills mob boss Gambol) announces he will destroy Gotham’s order and repeatedly taunts Batman, Dent, and Gordon. Bruce Wayne, suspecting financial ties to a Hong Kong accountant, sends Lucius Fox to investigate Lau of Lau's security investments. Batman travels to Hong Kong, captures Lau using a CIA sky-hook extraction, and brings Lau back to Gotham so Dent can use Lau’s knowledge to indict the mob under RICO charges. The arrests appear to be a major success — Dent gains public standing as Gotham’s “White Knight.”\n\nThe Joker retaliates: he assassinates corrupt figures (Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb by poisoning and Judge Surillo by car bomb) and attacks a fundraiser for Dent. Gordon is apparently killed saving Mayor Anthony Garcia; later Gordon is revealed to have faked his death to protect his family. The Joker attacks the convoy transporting Dent; a chase ends with Batman saving Dent from the Joker’s truck, and the Joker is captured and imprisoned at the Major Crimes Unit.\n\nThe Joker forces Batman and Gordon into a sadistic game: he plants simultaneous explosives targeting Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent. He manipulates Batman into going to Dent’s location and Gordon into going to Rachel’s. Both sites explode: Rachel is killed and half of Dent’s face is horribly burned. Lau is freed by the Joker during a breakout and later killed; the Joker also burns the mob money and several mobsters, escalating chaos. Broken by Rachel’s death and manipulated by the Joker, Harvey Dent becomes Two-Face, adopting a coin-based vigilante justice and seeking revenge on those he blames.\n\nThe Joker extorts Gotham again by rigging two ferries — one with civilians, one with prisoners — each with detonators to blow up the other. Batman, with reluctant technical help from Lucius Fox, uses a citywide sonar mapping system built from every cellphone to locate the Joker’s hideout and rescues the hostages; the ferries refuse to kill one another. Batman apprehends the Joker, who gloats that Dent’s fall will destroy Gotham’s hope.\n\nTwo-Face kidnaps Gordon’s family and brings Gordon and Batman to the ruined site of Rachel’s death, intent to kill Gordon’s son for Gordon’s perceived failures. Batman, wearing body armor, tackles Two-Face off a building; Two-Face dies. To preserve Dent’s image as Gotham’s symbol of lawful hope, Batman and Gordon conceal Dent’s crimes and present Two-Face’s killings as Batman’s responsibility. Gordon smashes the Bat-Signal; Alfred burns Rachel’s letter; Lucius destroys the sonar equipment. Batman becomes Gotham’s fugitive so that Harvey Dent can remain the city’s hero, and the Joker is left alive in custody, continuing to challenge Gotham’s moral order.",

      "a gang of 6 criminals rob a gotham city mob bank and start murdering each other for a higher share. they suggest that a sixth member of the gang - nicknamed 'the joker' - who did the planning, but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. at the end, only the joker (heath ledger) remains, and he escapes with the money. joker is a psychopathic illegal mastermind portraying himself as an \"agent of chaos\", who rises from the criminal underworld by thrusting gotham into anarchy. gordon arrives at the bank the joker held up earlier with ramirez who shows him the joker's picture from a security camera. batman arrives to inspect the scene, noting that they have irradiated the drug money to make it easier to trace. when gordon asks him if the joker is a threat, batman informs him that he cannot worry about one man when there is an entire mob to bring down. batman (christian bale) is the alter ego of a billionaire socialite bruce wayne who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging at age 8, travels the world for seven years before returning home to operate as a bat-masked vigilante hailed as gotham city's \"dark knight\", using fear against the city's criminal underworld at night.\ndistrict attorney harvey dent (aaron eckhart) is hailed as gotham's \"white knight\", who is running a campaign against the criminal underworld.\nlieutenant jim gordon (gary oldman) of the police department works under the current police commissioner. gotham is then seen at night with criminals afraid to commit crimes under the watchful sign of the bat-signal projected onto the clouds. lt. james gordon mans the bat-signal, waiting for batman with det. anna ramirez (monique gabriela curnen), who asks if he's coming. gordon explains that it is okay if he is not, hoping that he is busy elsewhere. he asks about ramirez' mother, who's in the hospital. meanwhile, in a parking garage, the scarecrow (cillian murphy), still at-large after escaping arkham asylum, is negotiating with the russian mob members, led by the chechen, over the sale of some of his fear-inducing drugs. the sale is interrupted when some of gotham's citizens dressed as batmen wanna-be's begin shooting at the men. as he gases one of the fake batmen with his mind-altering drugs from his cuff, the scarecrow notes that they are not the real batman, because batman would never use a gun. suddenly the batmobile/tumbler crashes through a barricade. the batmobile, pre-programmed to \"loiter\" and then \"intimidate\", fires rockets into a nearby office, sending the remaining mobsters running. the real batman arrives and bends the rifle barrel of one of the wanna-be batmen before knocking him out. the chechen sends his rottweilers to attack the batmen, and as batman saves them he takes the dogs out after being badly bitten in the arm. the scarecrow attempts to flee in a white van but batman jumps onto the van and begins cutting into the side with his device called the mangler. scarecrow swerves into a support which sends batman to the ground. as scarecrow gets away down a spiraling passageway, batman leaps onto the roof of his van, smashing it to a halt. he leaves the fake batmen and the scarecrow along with some of the mobsters tied up together for the police to eventually round up. when one of the impostors says he's trying to help, batman harshly tells him he doesn't need any help. the next day, as bruce wayne stitches himself up from the dog bite. alfred (michael caine) notices bruce keeping a close watch on newly appointed district attorney harvey dent via some computer screens, as bruce is trying to decide whether or not dent can be trusted. alfred wonders if he is really spying on the relationship that rachel dawes has developed with harvey dent. harvey dent arrives in court to join rachel dawes in prosecuting mobster salvatore maroni (eric roberts), the alleged new leader of the falcone crime family. one of maroni's men takes the fall in court and attempts to shoot dent from the witness stand. the gun doesn't go off and dent punches the man before he is hauled off to jail. maroni is eventually set free, to the dismay of dent. dent meets lt. gordon, and after a short exchange of words, they both express their distrust for those that are working in each other's offices. harvey interrogates gordon over his involvement with the batman and harvey tells him he wants to meet him. gordon requests search warrants for five banks that are believed to be holding the remainder of the mobs money. dent agrees to back gordon's search warrants, forming a tenuous trust with the honest gordon. lucius fox holds a board meeting at wayne enterprises, negotiating an joint venture with lau, the head of lau security investments, based in hong kong. after the meeting with lau, wayne expresses his reservations with lucius fox about lau's business operation, apparently illegal based on their profits. after agreeing to cancel the deal, wayne asks fox for a new suit. he explains that he needs to be lighter, and faster, in case he runs into any more guard dogs and that he wants to be able to turn his head. that night, harvey dines out with rachel. harvey tells rachel he had to make a reservation weeks earlier, and even then needed to exercised his influence to get a table at the very fashionable restaurant. bruce and his date, the prima ballerina for the russian ballet, encounter rachel and harvey. bruce has them pull a table together so they can dine together, informing harvey that he owns the restaurant. at first, bruce seems jealous and threatened by harvey, based on the fact that he is dating rachel, but harvey explains how he supports the work of batman and appreciates his help. bruce changes his tune and informs harvey that he intends to throw a massive fund-raiser for him. bruce wayne is impressed with dent's idealism as dent has gone after every money launderer in the city and he knows that batman and gordon are going after the mob's money supply, and wants in.\nbruce offers to support his career; he believes that, with dent as gotham's protector, he can give up being batman and lead a normal life with rachel dawes (maggie gyllenhaal).\nrachel is gotham city's assistant district attorney and bruce's childhood friend, who is one of the few people who knows batman's true identity. although rachel and dent are currently dating. mob bosses sal maroni (eric roberts) (an italian mafia boss who takes over carmine falcone's mob), gambol (michael jai white) (an african american mafia boss in charge of illegal gambling and extortion for the mob), and the chechen (ritchie coster) (in charge of drug-trafficking for the mob) hold a video-conference with their corrupt accountant, lau (ng chin) (a corrupt chinese lsi holdings accountant triad boss), who has hidden their funds for safekeeping and fled to hong kong. lau says that gordon and dent have raided all the mob banks, but he moved the money before they could get to it. the money will be in hk where us authorities can't touch it. the meeting is interrupted by the joker, who warns them that batman is unhindered by the law (and alleges that lau would squeal to the police) and offers to kill batman in exchange for half of their money. the mob laughs, and as one of the mobsters, gambol, rises from his seat and threatens the joker, the joker opens his coat, exposing grenades. gambol tells the joker that he's putting a price out on his head. the joker tells the mob that when they plan to take things a little more seriously, give him a call, and presents them with 'his card', a joker playing card. and with that, he exits. but not before warning that batman will come for lau. gambol is playing pool with some of his associates until one of them informs him that a group of hoodlums have killed the joker, and has the body. the body is brought in covered in a bag, and as gambol is about to pay, the joker rises up and holds a knife to his face while his men hold guns to his associates' heads. the joker tells a story about how he got his scars from his father, and then kills gambol. batman has a meeting with gordon and dent and promises to bring back lau to us. batman finds lau in hong kong. bruce wayne's company was already investigating lau's company for a possible takeover bid, but in reality, bruce was just getting a good look at his books.\nfox shows wayne his new suit, and wayne begins planning an impromptu trip to hong kong. fox will accompany him, making it look like the only reason for his visit was to cancel the negotiations with lau's company. meanwhile, fox arrives in hong kong to meet with lau. he checks in his mobile phone at the front desk at lau's building, as there are no cell phones allowed on the premises. fox meets with lau, and informs him of wayne enterprises' plans to cancel negotiations with his company. however, he secretly keeps one cell phone in his pocket, which has been adapted to produce a sonar map of the surrounding area. upon leaving the building, he does not pick up the phone he dropped off, and he produces the map of the building to bruce wayne. that night, the phone that fox left at the front desk emits a high frequency that shuts down all power in the building. batman crashes in through a window in lau's office, and after a vicious fight with some of his guards, grabs lau and escapes by sending a balloon attached to a cable to a plane he has chartered flying over lau's building. batman brings lau back to gotham to testify by capturing lau in his hk office and using the cia's sky-hook project to bring him out, allowing dent to apprehend the entire mob. back in gotham, lau is interrogated by rachel with dent and gordon looking on. rachel presses him to give them the money lau has taken, but lau will not give in. after she threatens to have him moved to the county lock-up, lau tells her that he can give them the names of the mobsters and their pooled investments. dent then realizes that they will have the leverage they need in a rico case of conspiracy to link all of the mob members together. gordon decides to keep lau in his holding cell at the major case unit building and lau agrees to cooperate with the police and give the names of the mob members. gordon appears at maroni's restaurant as the police rush in to arrest all of the mob members in attendance. as all of the mob members that lau informed the police are rounded up for arraignment, judge janet surrillo finds a joker card in the middle of the stack of conviction papers. dent gives a televised impromptu interview denying batman's involvement while expressing gratitude for the police work in bringing the mob members to justice. the joker threatens a string of murders unless batman reveals his identity and starts by killing police commissioner gillian b. loeb (colin mcfarlane) and judge surillo, who is presiding over the mob trial. the judge's car blows up when the police arrive to take her into protective custody and commissioner loeb dies of severe poisoning from his liquor bottle before gordon can stop him from drinking. batman is able to save dent when joker attacks the fundraiser that bruce wayne had thrown for dent. the joker also targets mayor anthony garcia (nestor carbonell), but gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. joker infiltrates the police guard giving the 21-gun salute for the commissioner and aims his gun at the mayor. gordon spots this and comes in front of the bullet. dent learns that rachel is the next target. gordon's family is visited at home, to inform them of the death of gordon at the funeral ceremony. gordon's wife, barbara, shouts out at the empty sky to batman that he has brought this craziness upon gotham. gordon's young son catches a brief glimpse of batman mournfully watching the scene. bruce decides to reveal his identity. bruce arrives back in his penthouse to find rachel waiting. she tells him that turning himself in will not stop the joker's murderous rampage, but bruce says he has enough blood on his hands already. he reminds her that she promised him that they would be together if and when he hung up the mantle of batman. she tells bruce not to make her his only hope for a normal life and they share a kiss. she tells bruce that if he turns himself in as batman that the city will never let them be together. back at wayne's secret base of operations for batman, he and alfred begin destroying everything that might tie lucius fox or rachel to batman. alfred tries to talk bruce out of it, asking him to endure these trying times and allow batman to make the right choice that nobody else can for the good of the city. before bruce can reveal himself as batman dent announces that he is batman. rachel, watching the news conference at bruce wayne's penthouse, confronts alfred over bruce's seeming cowardice in allowing harvey to take the fall when he claims to be batman. alfred explains to rachel that batman is instead allowing himself to be something else besides a hero, mainly a figure outside of the system that the people can both turn to or blame in times of need, that batman can 'take it\". rachel gives alfred a letter for bruce and tells him to give it to bruce when the time is right. when alfred asks what it is, she tells him it is open and hugs him before departing to see harvey as he is being transported to the county lock-up. dent is taken into protective custody, but the joker appears and attacks the convoy. while transporting harvey, the joker and some goons start taking out the police cars in a large semi-truck. he pulls out an rpg and begins firing at the armored truck carrying dent. the tumbler arrives and attempts to stop the joker and is hit by one of the joker's rpgs. his car takes 'catastrophic' damage, and he's forced to eject. however, the ejection in this car is a bike, the batpod, that deploys out the front of the car. batman chases down the joker on his batpod, and after firing some cables at the truck and weaving them through some light poles and buildings, flips the truck completely over. the joker emerges with a smith & wesson m76 submachine gun and shoots at batman, who speeds towards him on his batpod, all the while screaming at batman to hit him. batman honors his own non-lethal code and swerves around the joker then crashes into the flipped truck, falling to the ground. as the joker jumps on him with a knife, one of the swat officers holds a shotgun to the back of his head, and upon removing his helmet and mask, shows that it was lt. gordon, who faked his death to protect his family. the joker is hauled away to the mcu. harvey gets out of the truck and into a cruiser, stating he is off to see a worried girlfriend.\nat gordon's major crimes unit building, gordon is promoted to commissioner by the mayor. rachel and dent are escorted away by detectives on maroni's payroll. gordon later learns that they never arrived home. batman interrogates the joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. batman races to save rachel, while gordon attempts to rescue dent. batman arrives at the site but realizes that the joker sent him to dent's location instead. both buildings explode, killing rachel and disfiguring half of dent's face. the joker escapes the lockup with lau (after he triggers a bomb that he had smuggled inside the stomach of another prisoner), whom he later kills along with the chechen (by setting them on fire along with the mob's money). lucius fox is the recently promoted ceo of wayne enterprises who, now fully aware of his employer's double life, serves more directly as bruce's armorer for the batsuit in addition to his corporate duties.\ncoleman reese, an accountant at wayne enterprises, claims to know about certain problems with wayne's funding in research and development, claiming that wayne has some sort of government project with cell phones for the army underway. he also uncovers fox's designs for the batmobile/tumbler. he wanted fox to pay him $10mm per year for the rest of his life to keep quiet. not wanting reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills reese within the hour. gordon orders the evacuation of all hospitals in gotham and goes to secure reese. the joker breaks into dent's hospital in the confusion and gives dent a gun and convinces him to seek revenge for rachel's death. he convinces dent to become an agent of chaos just like himself, then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. dent goes on a killing spree, as the vigilante two-face, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin-one side having been scorched in the explosion. he kills sal and the 2 corrupt cops whom he held responsible for rachael's death after announcing gotham will be subject to his rule come nightfall, the joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives, one containing ordinary folks and the other containing prisoners. he threatens to blow them both up by midnight but will let one ferry live if its passengers (who have been supplied the detonator to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. batman finds the joker by exploiting the sonar capabilities of all phones in the city, with the reluctant help of lucius fox (morgan freeman). fox says that he will resign from his post after this assignment. both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while batman apprehends the joker after a brief fight. joker was hiding in a building and had disguised all the hostages as his henchmen, with guns taped to their hands and wearing masks. batman saves all hostages from gordon's swat teams before apprehending joker. before the swat arrive to take the joker into custody, he gloats that gotham's citizens will lose hope once dent's rampage becomes public knowledge. gordon and batman arrive at the building where rachel perished, and encounter two-face, who has kept gordon's family as hostages. two-face shoots batman, and threatens to kill gordon's son, claiming that gordon's negligence is responsible for rachel's death. before he flips his coin for the boy, batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles two-face off the building to his death. batman persuades gordon to hold him responsible for the killing spree and preserve dent's heroic image. dent is hailed as a hero and the police launch a manhunt for batman. gordon destroys the bat-signal, fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and alfred pennyworth (michael caine) burns a letter from rachel saying she planned to marry dent (she had given this letter to alfred before her death)."

        "summary": "Kinetic, concise, and stylish; John Wick kicks ass.",
        "text": "The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it&#39;s Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it&#39;s his dog. That&#39;s essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It&#39;s a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.<br/><br/>As an action movie buff, all I wanted to see in this movie is some inventive action sequences, and I was not disappointed. Every single action sequence in this movie is fast-paced, beautifully shot, fluid, intense, and you never have trouble understanding what&#39;s going on. The direction of this film is fantastic, as is the writing. There&#39;s no melodramatic soapy story lines - everything is straight and to the point, and the point is to get to the action. Not one moment in this movie is boring. The short dialogue is effective from getting to action sequence A to sequence B without any confusion as to any character&#39;s motive. It&#39;s all laid out in front of you - all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the insanity happening on screen.<br/><br/>Remember when Live Free or Die Hard came out and people were upset that John McClane only fired pistols throughout the entire movie? I like a little versatility when it comes to action heroes, and evidently so do the writers. John Wick wrecks face with pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, knives, even mano-a-mano; the man can do anything. The difference between John Wick and other modern action movies (Die Hard 5 and Taken 3 for instance) is that you actually believe John Wick is killable. He&#39;s not some invincible superhero like Bruce Willis was in Die Hard 5, having his car crash and flip like a hundred times and the second it stops he gets out without a scratch and starts running. No, John Wick takes a beating in this film. Numerous times in fact. But most of the time he&#39;s kicking ass and taking names, and instead of acting as some unstoppable killing machine, he just seems like a guy who&#39;s an expert in his field. He used to be a hit-man after all.<br/><br/>John Wick is a blast to watch. Really, it&#39;s just a mindlessly fun action movie. It has large-scale shootouts, CQC sequences, and a classic hero-villain hand-to-hand confrontation at the end. The only negative I can say about the movie is that the villains aren&#39;t anything to write home about. They&#39;re Russian mobsters which we&#39;ve seen a million times, and their leader isn&#39;t given enough to work with as far as character goes. Willam DaFoe has a brief but important role though as Wick&#39;s former colleague. <br/><br/>Regardless, John Wick is all about the action and it goes above and beyond in every respect. It&#39;s a breath of fresh air after all the poor sequels we&#39;ve been getting, and thankfully John Wick has the potential to be the next great action franchise. An absolute must-watch for action fans."
      },
      {
        "summary": "Story: 3 minutes; Entertainment: 101 minutes.",
        "text": "It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies. Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren&#39;t present here.<br/><br/>Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they&#39;re smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.<br/><br/>And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call."

Not only that, it brought back a struggling but beloved actor like Keanu Reeves and connected him to a character for a decade, once again becoming an icon like Mr. Anderson/Neo in &quot;The Matrix.&quot;\nSimple premise, brilliant execution. It&#39;s a film with a purpose from its conception, but it also develops the character layer by layer. It gives us context, motivation, unbridled fury, and a brutality that other films have subsequently attempted to emulate with much less success and impact.<br/><br/>Nothing suggested that this film would become a saga with several sequels, millions of dollars, a series, spin-offs, and much more.<br/><br/>It has brought actors forgotten by Hollywood and the big spotlight back into the spotlight, and that&#39;s appreciated.<br/><br/>A separate detail is the work of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, those wonderful choreographies that one saw in Asian action films or anime, and that gave it that unique touch that characterizes it today.<br/><br/>And all of this was &quot;only&quot; triggered because some Russian thugs decided to steal Baba Yaga&#39;s car and kill her dog..."

When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn&#39;t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½"

        "text": "Lesson learned: don&#39;t get on retired legendary hit-man John Wick&#39;s bad side. In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick&#39;s style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn&#39;t have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him. <br/><br/>If you&#39;re planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you&#39;re going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy&#39;s Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn&#39;t have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star."

        "text": "Keanu Reeve is John Wick. He&#39;s a deadly and unstoppable hit-man, and it shows. &quot;John Wick&quot; is short and to the point, but so much fun. At 1 hour and 36 minutes running time, there is never a dull moment in what may be one of the best action films of the year. <br/><br/>The film starts off quickly and never stops. It doesn&#39;t spend too much time on the backstory or development of Wick&#39;s life, yet it still succeeds so well in building up his character. Within the first 20 minutes, John Wick is called out of retirement when three robbers break into his home, steal his car, and kill his dog. Even before the action begins though, the film builds up so much suspense and gravity into who this &quot;John Wick&quot; is, resulting in a satisfying and exhilarating moment when his enemies realize he&#39;s back in the game. <br/><br/>While the plot may be simple and straightforward, it works sufficiently in setting up a situation where the rest of the greatness can happen - stylized and awesome fight sequences where John Wick goes through dozens and dozens of kills. Seeing this in digital IMAX really helped boost the mood of the film; the intense sound design and visuals, the slick fighting and choreography on screen. There&#39;s this one scene in the film where John Wick assaults his way through a club, and all those elements combined make it an absolutely incredible sequence to witness. <br/><br/>Besides John Wick and his fighting, the film does set up a very interesting world, thanks to all the other little details and characters it brings in. There is an organized system of those on the other side of the law, operating and exchanging &quot;gold coins&quot; while staying at bases such as &quot;The Continental&quot; hotel; this definitely allows room for sequels and spin-offs. <br/><br/>Still, Keanu Reeves is the star of the show, and this is the best I have seen him in quite awhile. Again, the story is straightforward and audiences know what emotional journey to expect, but Keanu displays a good amount of range in his portrayal of Wick that is still nice to see. Just like his character states, I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s back. &quot;John Wick&quot; is an awesome and enjoyable action flick that I would recommend. RATING: [8/10]"

        "text": "I really don&#39;t understand the love that &quot;John Wick&quot; receives. It&#39;s just kind of a generic action thriller to me. No different than a &quot;Bourne&quot; or &quot;Taken&quot; movie. It gets a slight bump for me in a rating of 6 instead of 5 because I did think that the cinematography was really good and also the fight choreography was top notch. I can definitely see the influence of martial arts films on this.<br/><br/>As for the story, it&#39;s basically not there. What&#39;s worse is the fact that the movie goes out of its way to constantly remind you that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as a character is someone who is incredibly lethal and dangerous and feared by criminals. In my opinion, this completely kills whatever dramatic weight the cheesy storyline that &quot;they killed my dog and stole my car&quot; plot has to begin with.<br/><br/>I guess people liked it well enough because it&#39;s got three sequels and more to come. Personally I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any better than the average Netflix Original action movie. Huge skip in my opinion."

        "text": "John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80&#39;s sensibility. It&#39;s nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!<br/><br/>Old school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I&#39;ve ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I&#39;ve never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don&#39;t know what the body count is, but it&#39;s gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don&#39;t see that that often in films. It&#39;s got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that &quot;Mayhem&quot; Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. ) <br/><br/>I Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team&#39;s covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn&#39;t be an action movie without some action. There&#39;s plenty of it, and it&#39;s perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven&#39;t seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie! <br/><br/>The last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy&#39;s death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn&#39;t a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.<br/><br/>When sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they&#39;ve messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it."

At a gas station, Iosef Tarasov, son of Russian crime boss Viggo Tarasov, tries to buy John’s 1969 Boss 429 Mustang; John refuses. That night Iosef and two accomplices break into John’s home, beat him, steal the Mustang and kill the puppy. Aurelio, owner of a chop shop, recognizes the stolen Mustang and tells John Iosef is Viggo’s son. Viggo visits John to apologize and reveals John’s past as a feared hitman known as the “Baba Yaga,” and that John had earned his freedom by completing one final task after falling in love with Helen. John recovers a hidden cache of weapons and gold coins from a secret stash and begins hunting Iosef’s men, killing the three burglars who attacked him. Viggo places a $2 million bounty on John and hires Marcus, John’s old friend and mentor, and other killers to stop him. John checks into the Continental Hotel (run by Winston), a neutral safe haven for assassins, then goes after Iosef at the Red Circle nightclub but is forced to flee after an attack by Viggo’s henchman Kirill. A contract killer, Ms. Perkins, sneaks into John’s room to collect the bounty; Marcus warns John with a sniper shot, John incapacitates Perkins and she escapes. John finds and destroys Viggo’s cash and blackmail stash hidden in a church. Viggo confronts him; John is struck by Kirill’s car and captured, but Marcus intervenes, allowing John to kill Kirill and extract Iosef’s safe-house location. John assaults the safe house and kills Iosef. Perkins, who witnessed Marcus saving John, reveals Marcus’s role to Viggo; Viggo has Marcus arrested, tortured and executed as punishment. Viggo taunts John by phone; John ignores Marcus’s death until Viggo prepares to flee the city by helicopter. Winston has Perkins executed for breaking Continental rules. John launches a final pursuit to New York Harbor, fights Viggo and mortally wounds him. Believing he will die from his injuries, John watches a video Helen recorded telling him they need to go home. He breaks into an animal clinic, treats his wounds, rescues and adopts a pit bull puppy that was scheduled for euthanasia, and begins to walk home, alive and holding the new dog.",

      "in new york city, john wick is grieving the death of his wife helen, who had arranged for him to receive a beagle puppy to help cope with his loss. a few days later, a group of russian gangsters led by iosef tarasov accost john at a gas station and fail to intimidate him into selling them his 1969 boss 429 mustang.[ii] that night, they break into john's home, assault him, kill the puppy, and steal the car. iosef takes the mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, aurelio, recognizes it and refuses service. aurelio informs john that iosef is the son of viggo tarasov, the boss of new york city's russian mafia. upon learning of his son's actions, viggo berates iosef for incurring john's wrath. he reveals john was once a hit-man in his employ, and was renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \"baba yaga\", a ruthless, relentless \"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will\". after john fell in love with helen, a civilian, viggo gave him a seemingly impossible task to earn his freedom; he succeeded. john recovers a concealed stash from his former career that includes weapons and gold coins. he rejects viggo's attempt to make amends and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. viggo puts a $2 million bounty on john and enlists john's former mentor, marcus, to kill him. john lodges at the continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal business is forbidden. winston, the hotel's owner and john's old friend, informs him that iosef is at a nightclub called red circle. john infiltrates red circle and confronts iosef, but he is attacked by viggo's henchman kirill and forced to retreat to the continental for medical attention. as john rests, a hit-woman, ms. perkins, sneaks into his room. marcus sees perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert john, who wakes up and subdues her. perkins reveals viggo has doubled the bounty for her to kill john in the hotel and has concealed a high-value stash in a church. john hires another hit-man, harry, to secure perkins but she kills harry and escapes. at the church, john destroys viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. when viggo arrives to assess the damage, john assaults him and his men but is hit by kirill's car and captured. john tells viggo he will not stop until iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for helen. marcus again intervenes to save john, who kills kirill and threatens viggo into revealing iosef's location in a safe house. john attacks the safe house and kills iosef. marcus encourages john to return to his everyday life. perkins witnesses this and reveals marcus's duplicity to viggo, who has him tortured and killed. viggo calls john to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city. winston has perkins executed for breaking the continental's rules, then informs john that viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. john races to new york harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds viggo. john, resigned to dying from his injuries, watches on his phone a video of helen telling him they need to go home. he breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pit bull puppy scheduled to be euthanize before beginning to walk home."

        "text": "At this point in time I have seen all of the MCU movies to date and I can easily say that Captain America is my favourite Marvel Hero. I think he is my favourite for two reasons one being that he is one of the most fun to watch during action scenes but also the fact that he is a very well grounded character. Caps entire goal is to do more and help in anyway he can which to me makes him the ideal superhero.<br/><br/>Red Skull in this wasn&#39;t all that interesting to me. He just seems like your regular old run of the mill villain. Hugo Weaving did do a great job as the Red Skull but the character himself wasn&#39;t all that good.<br/><br/>Hayley Atwell is great and has a very good relationship with Chris Evans as Captain America. She is a huge part of why the movie ending was emotional. Bucky played by Sebastian Stan is great and also has a very nice on screen dynamic with Chris Evans.<br/><br/>During the middle act of this movie we got a lot of montages and then we had one action scene. I really enjoy the action scenes in this but I do feel that having montages and one action scene be your middle act is very weak storytelling.<br/><br/>Overall Captain America The First Avenger is a good movie. It gives some fun scenes with great characters, but the structure of the movie and the villain needed to be thought out a little more for the movie to be considered great.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

        "text": "I have had the pleasure of watching &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger,&quot; a Marvel movie that tells the origin story of one of the most iconic superheroes in the Marvel Universe. Directed by Joe Johnston, this film is set in the 1940s and follows the story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny but determined young man who is transformed into a super-soldier and fights against the evil forces of HYDRA during World War II.<br/><br/>One of the things that impressed me about this film was the way it captures the spirit of the time period. The film&#39;s visual style and production design are absolutely stunning, transporting viewers back to the 1940s with great authenticity. The film&#39;s use of sepia-toned colors and vintage aesthetic make it feel like a classic comic book come to life.<br/><br/>Chris Evans gives a standout performance as Steve Rogers, bringing a vulnerability and humanity to the character that makes his transformation into Captain America all the more compelling. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Hayley Atwell delivering a strong performance as Peggy Carter, Tommy Lee Jones adding a touch of humor as Colonel Phillips, and Hugo Weaving embodying the menacing Red Skull with great conviction.<br/><br/>The action scenes in the film are thrilling and well-executed, with the use of practical effects and CGI blending seamlessly to create an immersive experience. The pacing of the film is also well done, with a good balance between action and character development.<br/><br/>Overall, &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; is a triumph of superhero cinema that deserves more credit than it often receives. The film&#39;s strong performances, impressive visual style, and well-crafted story make it a standout among Marvel&#39;s vast cinematic universe."

It&#39;s a great origin story as it takes us back to the 40&#39;s to meet the first Avenger which keeps you engaged in a theme of love for others and America! The cast and acting is great along with great dialogue of happiness and sadness. The cinematography makes the movie feel more in place with the rest of the MCU. The editing is perfect and makes slower scenes not feel to slow and keeps pushing the story. The effects still hold to today with great sound, especially for the shield. The music and theme is perfect because it fits the American patriot tone and is even used many times in later MCU movies. Joe Johnston did a great job introducing Cap to the MCU. I wouldn&#39;t say this sticks out but is the perfect movie to make before the Avengers! 9.0/10. A-."

        "text": "Joe Johnston has done it again, managing to take what SHOULD be great action flick material and managed to make it, well, boring.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the film started out quite well. The change from puny wimp to super hero was well done, as was the intro sequence with red skull. The whole nazi-mysticism mystique was done very well. But it seemed that after Joe Johnston filmed these two or three well thought out portions, the rest of the film was just filler.<br/><br/>I caught myself looking at my watch a few times, just sort of wanting the movie to end - and this was at the 1/2 point of the film. The action sequences are fairly average for the most part and I really never got that &quot;edge of my seat&quot; feeling as the characters faced peril.<br/><br/>All in all, an above-average film which could have been great if someone with better directing chops had been chosen.<br/><br/>6/10"

        "text": "I separate this movie into to parts, the first and second half. The first being my personal favourite of the two with the most character development, main plot of the story and best dialogue. The second half being straight and fun action. The character that is Steve Rogers is by far the highlight of the movie, he is so courageous despite all his many flaws and continues to overcome his seemingly limitless barriers. It is wonderful to watch how he uses his new strength to fight his enemies and help his allies. Speaking of his enemies, red skull isn&#39;t portrayed extremely well, his is shown as a crazed man with a god complex, no other development or back story is given to the character, you could argue that it isn&#39;t really needed though. The introduction to Bucky Barnes&#39;s character is quite small but obviously leads to more later in his character arc. Besides this I don&#39;t have much else to say besides the action towards the end is quite good, a little drawn out a little silly and over the top but intense and enjoyable to watch. Also the soundtrack is incredible, it fits extremely nicely and is very uplifting. Also Also the comedy in the movie, which there is few, is far better than I remember and isn&#39;t just thrown in at the most random places. Overall a good origin story 7/10!"

        "text": "I loved this movie. Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you&#39;ll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.<br/><br/>1. The technology for WWII is too far advanced! This one was the most common and the stupidest in my opinion. It&#39;s called &quot;Fiction&quot;, as in &quot;not real&quot;. Every time I heard this one it made me think these people have no suspension of disbelief and would complain that Iron Man is a terrible movie because the technology to build a flying robot suit doesn&#39;t exist yet. People, it&#39;s comic books and it&#39;s in a fictional WWII setting. It&#39;s allowed to take liberties.<br/><br/>2. Captain America is too invincible! That was just stupid. Captain America is relatively weak compared to many other superheroes, he&#39;s just a perfect example of a human being brought about by the experiments in the film. Also, he&#39;s the main character. He&#39;s not supposed to die in a movie that is leading him up to be in a tie-in to all the other recent Marvel films that will lead to The Avengers.<br/><br/>3. Red Skull is a terrible villain.<br/><br/>There is no sense to this one. He&#39;s supposed to be the guy that&#39;s worse than Hitler and can get just as many people on his side to do his bidding. On top of that he can take Cap in a fight fairly evenly. Saying he&#39;s a bad villain is baseless.<br/><br/>4. Steve doesn&#39;t go through a character arc/get any back-story.<br/><br/>For one, he really doesn&#39;t need to. Steve was a good guy from the start, and he did go through an arc. It was subtle, but he did. He gained more confidence and become the soldier he is. He has a back-story but it&#39;s weaved in throughout. We know he was bullied a lot, we know he he is from a military family, we know he grew up with Bucky, we know he has had very few, if any, dates in his life, he&#39;s a childhood friend of Bucky, and we know he wants to be a soldier because he feels its his duty. I&#39;d rather get it weaved in through the narrative of the story rather than get a huge text dump or just have characters talking for half an hour about everything they&#39;ve ever done.<br/><br/>5. This movie just glorifies America! Not really. It&#39;s a good vs. evil story that happens to have a character named Captain America, which was given to him by a publicity stunt. I suppose you also hate movies like Saving Private Ryan because it tells things from the perspective of American soldiers but not the Japanese ones? <br/><br/>These were the most common arguments and they are easily refutable. Captain America is a great movie, showcasing one of the best Marvel has to offer and should be in the 7s or higher, not the 6s."

There is no ambiguity here at all, it&#39;s a case of the good guys versus the bad, Captain America is a wholesome, kind and brave American, Schmidt is a fairly basic, scheming villain, Hugo Weaving makes him interesting though.<br/><br/>I rate Chris Evans, I&#39;m a big fan of his, and I did very much like the way he played the part, there was a degree of humility, a whole lot of sincerity.<br/><br/>Some nice special effects, and plenty of action scenes.

        "text": "Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?<br/><br/>Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-adventure movie that shows us the transformation of one Steve Rogers from a scrawny but patriotic man during World War II to Captain America, the star-spangled icon of freedom. Equipped with the Super-Soldier serum and his desire to do good, he finds the strength to combat Hydra, a Nazi offshoot, and its deranged leader, Johann Schmidt.<br/><br/>To a great extent, the First Avenger succeeds in translating the essence of its title character to the big screen. Captain America is portrayed as a humble guy who just wants to serve his country, so much so that he goes to great lengths to do it. Although there are minor changes to his comic book origin, who Captain America is is preserved. Steve Rogers may have said that he&#39;s &quot;just a kid from Brooklyn,&quot; but he is definitely so much more than that. He is the hero whom people look up to, and whom superheroes aspire to be. Captain America may not have the coolest powers but is relatable in so many levels.<br/><br/>It is becoming a trend in movies today to have a complicated plot in order to tell a good story. However, the First Avenger&#39;s approach, which centers on Captain America fighting the good fight, is pretty straightforward. The film proves that you don&#39;t need gazillion mind-boggling things to tell an inspiring tale of an extraordinary soldier on the frontlines. Being a superhero movie set in a war zone, it offers a healthy dose of action and involves Captain America bashing enemy heads and throwing his signature shield more times than you can count. Scenes of romance and humor help the film to become balanced and entertaining to watch. Steve is also a nice break from the morally conflicted heroes we usually encounter. He is simply someone who is moved to do what is right—nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Aside from the excellent character development and story progression, the film also boasts a solid cast. I honestly had doubts about Chris Evans playing the captain because he was such a fit for the cocky yet strong-willed Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, but he gives a convincing performance. Hugo Weaving as the menace Red Skull doesn&#39;t disappoint either, although we are still sure to remember him best as Agent Smith in the Matrix trilogy. Hayley Atwell&#39;s portrayal of Peggy Carter has a sense of both hardiness and elegance which makes the character easy to love. <br/><br/>As someone who consistently follows Captain America&#39;s exploits in comic books, my admiration for the character has increased even more because of the First Avenger. The film gives fans everywhere a good show. I especially liked that they were able to incorporate the printing of a Captain America comic book in a world where he really exists. The punching of &quot;Hitler&quot; in the face never gets old!<br/><br/>During the course of Captain America: The First Avenger, viewers are shown how to be a patriot through Cap&#39;s positive demeanor and outlook. In the end, we come to realize that the film deals with fighting for the things we love – freedom, country, friend and even one&#39;s own potential to do great things. The ending of the film may have been a bit abrupt, but it definitely points to a sequel. In this case, The Avengers (2012) is just around the corner, and it is something that we should watch if we want more of our Captain America.<br/><br/>Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?<br/><br/>Of course. There is no other option."

      "plot_summary": "In 1942 New York, frail Brooklyn native Steve Rogers repeatedly fails military physicals but is determined to serve. Dr. Abraham Erskine notices Steve's courage and recruits him for Project Rebirth, a U.S. government super-soldier program overseen by Colonel Chester Phillips. Erskine explains he fled Nazi research after an earlier experiment with Johann Schmidt (Red Skull) produced monstrous results. Erskine administers the super-soldier serum and Vita-Ray procedure; Steve's body is transformed into peak human condition. Immediately after, a Hydra spy assassinates Erskine and destroys the remaining serum; Steve chases the assassin, who kills himself, and is left the sole successful super-soldier. The War Department, led by Senator and military brass, repackages Rogers as a morale-boosting publicity figure called \"Captain America,\" sending him on a staged bond tour with comic stage routines, much to Steve's frustration.\n\nWhen Steve's friend James \"Bucky\" Barnes and the 107th Infantry are captured by Hydra in Europe, Steve demands to fight. Howard Stark covertly airdrops him behind enemy lines near a Hydra weapons factory. Steve infiltrates the plant, confronts Johann Schmidt (now disfigured as the Red Skull) and Arnim Zola, destroys the factory and recovers a map of Hydra bases. He rescues Bucky and about 500 POWs, proving his combat value. Chester offers formal support, but Steve insists on operating with the same team of rescued soldiers. Howard gives Steve a rounded vibranium shield for protection.\n\nSteve leads strikes against Hydra's secret bases across Europe and the Swiss Alps, capturing scientist Arnim Zola, though Bucky dies during one raid. Zola reveals Hydra's last stronghold. Steve infiltrates the mountaintop complex and is captured and brought before Schmidt, who has harnessed the Tesseract (a mysterious cosmic energy cube) to power experimental weapons and a prototype bomber loaded with concentrated explosives labeled with U.S. city names. During an ensuing assault by Steve's team, Schmidt escapes in his jet-powered plane with the Tesseract powering its systems. Steve boards the plane, smashes the Tesseract's control console as Schmidt seizes the cube; the cube opens a space-like portal that disintegrates Schmidt. Realizing the plane will crash into populated areas, Steve pilots it away from civilians and crashes into the Arctic sea. He is reported missing and presumed dead.\n\nDecades later, S.H.I.E.L.D. recovers Steve's body and the crashed plane; Steve is found alive but frozen. Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. revive him and gradually reintroduce him to the modern world via a staged hospital set and simulated period environments. Confused and out of time, Steve is given a choice: work for S.H.I.E.L.D. to face new global threats. In a post-credits scene, Nick Fury briefs Steve about assembling other powered individuals, showing images of Tony Stark, Thor, Bruce Banner, and others—setting up the Avengers initiative.",

      "captain america is excavated from a crashed plane along with his shield.\njohann schmidt (hugo weaving), a high-ranking nazi, in search of a glass cube (the tesseract). jonhann is the top-ranking scientist in nazi germany, working on superpowers from the occult. he finds the tesseract in norway. in new york, steve rogers (chris evans) is a thin asthmatic found ineligible for us military service. he friend james \"bucky\" barnes has been accepted & is accepted to 107th infantry. dr. abraham erskine (stanley tucci) notices steve, & his determination despite his appearance. he is also on the recruitment board & accepts steve when he applies next. meanwhile johann works with arnim zola to harness the power of the cube to create energy weapons. they are both part of hydra which earlier operated under nazi, but to grow further johann terminates his association to hitler & goes independent. erskine takes steve for basic training under colonel chester phillips (tommy lee jones). chester is supervising erskine's super soldier program. peggy carter (haley atwell) is a british officer on the platoon. despite being smallest & weakest, steve impresses all with his spirit and selflessness.\nerskine reveals to steve that he worked with johann earlier to create a serum that gives man superhuman strength. when erskine used it on johann it backfired & left him as a sinewy red skeleton. thats when erskine had to flee & join the us. erskine performs the procedure on steve instantly transforming him into a super soldier. a nazi spy kills erskine & steals the last serum & escapes. steve runs after the perpetrator & captures him, but the perpetrator swallows the vial of cyanide & kills himself. he has a tattoo of hydra on himself. as chester & peggy conduct their investigation, steve is enlisted by a senator to raise funds for the bond as a comic superhero captain america. he is taken overseas where he meets chester & peggy & finds that the 107th has been captured by hydra. eager to save bucky, steve wants to go in. howard is a private defense contractor and friend of peggy. when chester refuses to help steve, howard air drops steve behind enemy lines & near hydra's weapons plant. steve comes face to face with johann & sees his red skull face. johann escapes with arnim, & steve destroys the base & finds a map with the location of rest of hydra's bases. he rescues bucky & 500 other men of the 107th. they return with the recovered weapons, much to the astonishment of chester. chester offers help to steve to pursue johann, but steve prefers the same team & the rescued prisoners who helped him in their first attack on hydra. howard gives steve a shield made of vibranium. lighter than steel & the strongest metal on earth. peggy is attracted to steve but finds him kissing another gi & is angry. steve manages to destroy many bases of hydra & even captures arnim on his journey through the swiss alps. but bucky dies in that operation. arnim reveals the location of hydra's last base.\nsteve goes headfirst into the base & is captured & brought in front of johann. the rest of the team attacks with surprise. johann has created a plane & stacked it with super bombs with the name of each major city in us. he takes off. steve pursues & kisses peggy before he jumps on the plane.\nthe plane is powered by the cube. steve destroys the cube console. as the cube escapes, it opens a space portal & johann is swept into it & disintegrated.\nsteve realizes that the plane is on auto pilot. he radios peggy & begs his forgiveness & dives the plane into the ocean. steve awakens in a 1940's hospital. an old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a dodger game. he gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. a young woman (amanda righetti) who bears a striking resemblance to peggy enters. she waits for a response from steve, who suspiciously looks at her. he asks why the radio is playing a mets game from may 1941... a game that he was at. she reaches into her pocket and withdraws a walky-talky. two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and steve easily tosses them through a wall. steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that he was on a movie-set. he runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open and appears in a modern skyscraper, bustling with people in business suits. he flees the building and finds himself in 2011's time square. he peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black suvs encircle him. nicky fury (samuel l jackson) steps out and carefully speaks to steve. he tells him that he's been asleep, in ice, for 70 years. the hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. still perplexed, steve breathes heavily and sadly tells fury that he had a date.\nin a post credit scene, steve is in an old-fashioned gym. he pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off it's chain and sends it flying across the room. fury enters the gym and asks steve if he's had trouble sleeping. steve cynically asks if fury has come with another mission. fury replies to the positive. suddenly we see images of all the superheroes, thor, tony stark (from the 'ironman' movies), hawkeye, black widow, bruce banner (from 'hulk') and other shield agents preparing for battle. fury, tells him that \"they're up.\" his personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete... and to be continued."

      "it is 1942, america has entered world war ii, and sickly but determined steve rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. everything changes when dr. erskine recruits him for the secret project rebirth. proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. when dr. erskine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of nazi germany's secret hydra research department (headed by johann schmidt, a.k.a. the red skull), rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot; however, when his comrades need him, rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him captain america, and his war against schmidt begins.",
      "during world war 2, steve rogers tries to enlist but is repeatedly rejected for his frail and sickly condition, however a scientist notes his determination and allows him to be accepted. what steve doesn't know is that this scientist is in charge of a government project to create super soldiers, in which steve is to be the first, but the colonel in charge of the project can't see what the scientist does in this scrawny runt - a strong inner character. meanwhile, johann schmidt, head of a german science division known as hydra, knows this scientist and fears the success of his project in america. it could mean trouble for the germans, so he sends a man to infiltrate and see if it's a success, and \"take care\" of the scientist if it is. it is, and he does, but not without steve and his new abilities chasing him down. with the doctor dead, no more american supermen will be forthcoming, and steve quickly becomes a mere u.s. war drive propaganda tool called \"captain america.\" his role is useful, if undignified, but he soldiers on with it dutifully till hearing of his best friend's unit's capture, for which he promptly heads out to rescue them. during this rescue, he meets the diabolical schmidt, and the two become each other's arch nemesis.",
      "at the outset of world war ii, steve rogers wants nothing more than to join the army. the only problem is that he can't pass the physical. he's tried several times under different names without success. dr. abraham erskine notes his eagerness and recruits him for an experimental project. rogers is soon transformed, both mentally and physically, into a super soldier where he eventually faces off against the nazi organization hydra and its head, known as red skull.",
      "steve rogers, a weak, sickly young man eager to fight is repeatedly rejected from the war-until a seemingly \"crazy\" scientist recruits him in a new experiment to turn the tides. he is transformed into the super soldier the world needs, but no one believes it. he is used as an empty face for propaganda until his comrades, including hid best and only friend, are captured by the red skull, a nazi general who wants to use the tesseract for evil. \"captain america\" breaks into red skull's hq with the help of peggy carter and howard stark, and captain america saves everyone. and everyone begins to realize what captain america can really do."

I really don&#39;t know how. &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen&#39;s story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham&#39;s Captain Stacy are truly special.<br/><br/>Can&#39;t wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn&#39;t want to blink because I didn&#39;t want to miss anything. You can watch this film over &amp; over &amp; finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn&#39;t expecting.<br/><br/>&quot;Across the Spider-Verse&quot; is another milestone for animation. Yes it&#39;s gorgeous &amp; visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen&#39;s story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it&#39;s visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie&#39;s real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.<br/><br/>What more can I say...It&#39;s an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It&#39;s outstanding. &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It&#39;s darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary."

It&#39;s easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I&#39;ve ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it&#39;s never too much.<br/><br/>I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn&#39;t feel as special.

        "text": "First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn&#39;t have &quot;Part One&quot; in the title. It doesn&#39;t really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it&#39;s kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can&#39;t wait to see the next one.<br/><br/>Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of &quot;Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it&#39;s crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.<br/><br/>The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I&#39;m even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn&#39;t been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.<br/><br/>One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can&#39;t take too many points off for that though.<br/><br/>The soudtrack is great, I can&#39;t wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.<br/><br/>And the story is awesome as well, although again it&#39;s hard to judge before seeing the next one. There&#39;s a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.<br/><br/>So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time."

Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece."

The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :<br/><br/>THE ARTWORK.<br/><br/>This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.<br/><br/>If this doesn&#39;t win the Oscar for best animated feature I&#39;m rioting, and you&#39;d better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW."

Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn&#39;t have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler.

Well, that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen&#39;s 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you&#39;re wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don&#39;t see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it&#39;s just not. It doesn&#39;t live up to the greatness of it&#39;s predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!"

After an Italian-renaissance Vulture appears through a portal, Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) and Jess Drew arrive and help Gwen. Miguel recruits Gwen into the Spider-Society, an interdimensional organization that polices the multiverse. On Earth-1610 (Brooklyn), Miles Morales is living with his parents Jeff and Rio while keeping his Spider-Man identity secret. The Spot (Jonathan Ohnn), an Alchemax scientist mutated by a collider, resurfaces and blames Spider-Man for his condition; he demonstrates the ability to open portals between universes and reveals that a spider from Earth-42 bit Miles a year earlier during an Alchemax experiment. Gwen returns to Earth-1610 to track the Spot and reconnects with Miles. She explains the Spider-Society but says there are no openings. When the Spot steals a collider on another world (Earth-50101) and grows stronger, Miles secretly follows Gwen through a portal. They team with Pavitr Prabhakar (Spider-Man India) and Hobie Brown (Spider-Punk) to confront the Spot. The Spot uses collider power to show Miles visions of future deaths — including Police Inspector Singh and Miles's father Jeff — then flees; the collider collapses and the world's canon event begins to break down. Members of the Spider-Society arrive to contain the damage and take Miles, Gwen, and Hobie to their headquarters on Earth-928, a massive complex where hundreds of spider-people live. Miguel explains the Society's doctrine: each universe contains fixed \"canon events\" (such as the death of a close figure) that must occur; deviations can destabilize and collapse entire universes and, by extension, the multiverse. Miguel reveals he witnessed a universe collapse and says Miles is an anomaly: the spider that bit Miles came from Earth-42, so Miles's existence altered multiple worlds. Miguel says saving Miles's father Jeff from a scheduled promotion-and-death would violate canon and possibly trigger collapse. Miguel imprisons Miles to stop him from interfering. Hobie quits the Society and helps Miles escape; Miguel orders the Society to capture Miles and ejects Gwen for breaking rules. Miguel confronts Miles and asserts that, because of Miles's existence, Earth-1610's Peter Parker would have survived and prevented the Spot. Miles overpowers Miguel and flees to the Society's go-home device, which identifies a target dimension by the spider DNA and sends anomalies back to their spider's home world. Miles attempts to return home but the machine sends him to Earth-42, the origin of the spider that bit him. On Earth-42 Miles finds his uncle Aaron Davis alive (Mahershala Ali) and his father dead; crime is rampant because there is no Spider-Man. He is captured by Aaron and also encounters Earth-42's version of Miles, who is the Prowler. Meanwhile Miguel forcibly returns Gwen to Earth-65; she reunites with her father George Stacy, who resigns as police captain and reconciles with her. At Society headquarters Hobie and other allies (including Peter B. Parker, Mayday Parker, Pavitr, Peni Parker, Spider-Ham, Spider-Noir and Margo Kess) assemble to find Miles. The Spot escalates his multiversal attack by hunting colliders across universes to increase his power. Gwen promises Miles's parents she'll find him. The film ends with Miles trapped on Earth-42 amid a world without its Spider-Man while the Spot continues attacking collider sites across the multiverse, setting up a larger conflict between Miles's impulse to save his father and the Spider-Society's mandate to preserve canon.",

      "on earth-65, police captain george stacy (shea whigham) is unaware that his daughter gwen stacy (hailee steinfeld) is spider-woman, who the police believe to be a murderer (when she failed to save her boyfriend from an alien attack, and was seen leaving the crime scene by the police).\none night, gwen encounters a version of the vulture (jorma taccone) from an italian renaissance-themed alternate universe. vulture had no clue how he ended up into gwen's universe, and had no concept of the multiverse either.\nmiguel o'hara/ spider-man 2099 (oscar isaac) and jess drew/earth-332 (issa rae) arrive using portal-generating watches and help gwen neutralize the vulture.\ngeorge corners gwen, who then reveals her identity to him; distraught, he attempts to arrest her. miguel reluctantly grants gwen membership into the spider-society (an elite strike force dedicated to the security of the universe), allowing her to escape with him and jess. in brooklyn on earth-1610, sixteen months after the alchemax collider's explosion, miles morales (shameik moore) encounters the spot, an alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during the explosion. due to his condition, the spot can simply travel through space at will by opening portals wherever he wants.\nthe spot / johnathon ohnn (jason schwartzman) blames miles for causing his condition and reveals that, while testing the collider, he had transported a spider from another dimension, earth-42, which then bit miles and turned him into spider-man. this incident took a year ago and since then miles has been fighting crime as spider-man. as part of the gig, he encountered his uncle aaron davis, who was a criminal and died in a duel with miles.\nmiles has not revealed his truth to his parents jeff and rio (lauren vélez). he aims to learn quantum physics at princeton university where they are experimenting on moving electrons across dimensional barriers. this way, he believes, he can learn to travel to other dimensions.\nthe spot says that he created spider-man and then the spider-man blew up the collider and turned johnathon into the spot. spot blames spider-man for the loss of his job, his life, his face and his family. the spot then accidentally transports himself into a void, where he learns to travel to other universes containing alchemax colliders to empower himself further. gwen travels to earth-1610 and reconnects with miles while tracking the spot. gwen tells miles about the spider society, who is trying to keep the multiverse from collapsing. gwen says that miles is the only real friend that she made since peter died. gwen says that the society is very strict about where she goes and for how long, else she would have visited sooner. gwen contemplates that in every other universe gwen falls for spider-man and it does not end well.\nmiles wants to join the society, but gwen says that it is a small, elite group and currently has no openings.\ngwen goes to spot's home in this dimension and figures out that he has taken the collider of that world. each collider gives spot more power and now he has the ability to create inter-dimensional portals by himself and control them. gwen and jess track spot to earth-50101. jess blames gwen for taking her eyes off spot to go to meet miles, and gives her an hour to fix the issue. miles secretly follows gwen through a portal to earth-50101, and they team up with local spider-man pavitr prabhakar / spider-man india (karan soni), and later hobie brown / spider-punk (daniel kaluuya), against the spot, who absorbs the power of that world's collider. the spot and miles share a vision of the spot's future attacks that include the deaths of police inspector singh (the father of pavitr's girlfriend gayatri) and miles' father jeff (daniel kaluuya). the spot departs and the collider collapses; miles saves singh from the ensuing destruction, but earth-50101 begins to fall apart from its disrupted \"canon event\" before members of the society arrive to contain the damage.\nmiles, gwen, and hobie are sent to the society's headquarters on earth-928, where hundreds of spider-people reside in a massive complex. miguel is the native spider-man of earth-928 and the founder of the spider-society. miles, along with gwen and hobie, meets with miguel and reunites with peter b. parker (jake johnson), who is accompanied by his infant daughter mayday. miguel explains to miles that each of the spider-people's stories throughout the multiverse contain \"canon events\", such as the deaths of a police captain close to spider-man, and that straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. miguel reveals that he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe. miles realizes that the spot murdering jeff, who is set to be promoted to police captain in two days, is a canon event. miguel imprisons miles to prevent him from saving jeff, but hobie helps miles break loose before quitting the society.\nas miles flees through the complex, miguel orders the society to capture him. hobie refuses to participate and quits the society, leaving earth-928.\nmiguel corners miles and tells him that he is the original anomaly: miles was never supposed to be spider-man, as the spider that bit him came from earth-42, resulting in earth-42 having no spider-man, and that if the spider had not bitten miles, earth-1610's peter parker would have stopped the collider and survived, and the spot would never have existed. miles overpowers miguel and flees to what he believes is his home dimension. the society had a \"go-home\" machine that is used to send the anomalies back to their dimensions. miles activates the machine, to go back home. the machine identifies that target dimension by analyzing the dna of the anomaly.\nconsidering gwen a liability, a furious miguel ejects her from the society and forcibly sends her back to earth-65. once there, gwen reunites with george, who has resigned from his job as police captain. the two reconcile, and george gives gwen a portal watch left by hobie. miles arrives in what he thinks is his home world. when he arrives in his bedroom he shares everything that happened to his mother, rio. he even tells her that he is spider-man. she has no idea who or what spider-man is and continues with the laundry. confused, miles continues to try to explain before \"glitching\". miles realizes that he is on earth-42, the home of the spider that bit him, rather than his own dimension. the go-home machine recognized the spider's signature from earth-42 and sent miles there.\nin this world, his uncle aaron davis (mahershala ali) is alive while his father is dead; because spider-man does not exist, new york city is riddled with unchecked crime. aaron restrains miles and is soon joined by earth-42's miles, who has become the prowler instead of aaron. as the society searches for miles in earth-1610, gwen travels there and speaks with his parents, promising to find him and bring him home.\nthe spot begins his multiversal attack, miles prepares to escape, and gwen assembles a team to find miles, consisting of peter b., mayday, pavitr, hobie, margo kess, spider-man noir, peni parker, and spider-ham."

Again, like many of the best Marvel films, the holes and flaws are covered up with humor and fan service, making everything okay. That being said, I did prefer Infinity War to this film, which really misses the leads of the other Marvel franchises that were &quot;snapped&quot; out. Overall, however, there are only a few ways you can wrap up the main story of the MCU, and this was a solid direction."

Some silly plot holes and characters that could&#39;ve been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...<br/><br/>The past thanos part wasn&#39;t necessary when you think about it, they could&#39;ve done this film without a real &#39;villain&#39; And it would&#39;ve worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.<br/><br/>To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. Really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should&#39;ve been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.<br/><br/>And the setting up for &#39;new avengers&#39; to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.<br/><br/>To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I&#39;ll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I&#39;ve given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8&#39;s and 9&#39;s. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.<br/><br/>It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don&#39;t give two cents about any of them."

        "text": "I feel like I&#39;m wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can&#39;t help but say a few spoiler-free words.<br/><br/>I&#39;m not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn&#39;t care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.<br/><br/>But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!<br/><br/>Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It&#39;s the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It&#39;s hard to see how they&#39;ll be able to top this one.<br/><br/>It&#39;s surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I&#39;ve laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it&#39;s a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the &#39;epic battle&#39; stakes), and even though it&#39;s three hours long, it doesn&#39;t feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.<br/><br/>Yes, it&#39;s a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).<br/><br/>If &quot;Return of the King&quot; managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It&#39;s as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.<br/><br/>Go see it."

        "text": "I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there&#39;s so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the &quot;I can do this all day&quot; CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.<br/><br/>I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.<br/><br/>The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.<br/><br/>Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner&#39;s relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn&#39;t cut it much, unfortunately.<br/><br/>The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don&#39;t know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.<br/><br/>The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they&#39;re changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else&#39;s timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.<br/><br/>There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.<br/><br/>Also, don&#39;t get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn&#39;t stop Thor&#39;s Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.<br/><br/>I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn&#39;t really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can&#39;t even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.<br/><br/>So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,."

      "plot_summary": "In 2018 Clint Barton (Hawkeye) kills criminals after his family is snapped away by Thanos; Tony Stark and Nebula drift in space after the snap and are rescued by Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) and returned to Earth. The surviving Avengers — Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, James Rhodes and Rocket — locate Thanos on the Garden planet, ambush him and learn he destroyed the Infinity Stones; Thor beheads Thanos. Five years later the world still mourns. Scott Lang (Ant-Man) returns from the Quantum Realm and proposes using quantum time travel to retrieve past Infinity Stones. The team (Stark, Rogers, Banner, Lang, Romanoff, Barton, Rocket, Nebula, Thor, Rhodes, Rocket) assemble, Stark builds a quantum GPS and Pym-particle supply is limited. They split into teams to steal stones from alternate pasts: 2012 New York (Space, Mind, Time), 2013 Asgard (Reality/aether), 2014 Morag (Power) and Vormir (Soul). In 2012 New York Banner gains the Time Stone from the Ancient One after convincing her Strange's choice was necessary; Stark and Lang lose the Tesseract to Loki. Rogers obtains the Scepter after a fight with his 2012 self. Stark and Rogers go to 1970 New Jersey to retrieve the Tesseract and extra Pym particles; Stark meets his father Howard and gains closure. On Asgard 2013, Thor retrieves the Reality Stone (Aether) with Rocket and proves himself again by calling Mjolnir. On Morag, Nebula and Rhodes collect the Power Stone but Nebula's past self is left behind and past Thanos uses the networked connection to learn the Avengers' plan, then infiltrates the future. On Vormir, Red Skull tells Natasha and Clint that the Soul Stone requires the sacrifice of a loved one; Natasha sacrifices herself so Clint can obtain the Soul Stone. The Avengers return to 2023, construct a gauntlet and Bruce Banner (as Smart Hulk) uses it to snap everyone back, severely injuring his arm. Past Nebula, captured by past Thanos in 2014, lets 2014 Thanos know of the Avengers' plan and is later killed by her future self on arrival. Thanos from 2014 brings his warship to 2023 and attacks the Avengers compound. A massive battle ensues: portals open with reinforcements (Doctor Strange, Wong, sorcerers, Wakandans, Asgardians, Ravagers) and the resurrected allies arrive. Thanos' forces overwhelm the field; the gauntlet changes hands repeatedly. Wanda Maximoff nearly kills Thanos trying to avenge Vision. Carol Danvers destroys Sanctuary II; Thanos gains the gauntlet and snaps, but Tony Stark had transferred the stones to his armor via nanotech. Tony declares \"I am Iron Man\" and snaps, erasing Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life. Stark dies surrounded by Pepper Potts, Rhodey and Peter Parker. The vanished return worldwide. At Tony's funeral the heroes mourn. Thor appoints Valkyrie ruler of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Steve Rogers returns the stones and Mjolnir to their timelines but remains in the past to live a life with Peggy Carter; an elderly Steve appears, gives Sam Wilson his shield and passes the mantle of Captain America to him.",

take the infinity stones back and reverse the destruction. they discover thanos, now horribly scarred, alone and undefended, cooking a meal. they launch an ambush, quickly pinning him down and cutting off the arm wearing the infinity gauntlet. it has been emptied of its stones. thanos reveals that he had destroyed them using their own powers, which nearly killed him, as he considered his work done and wanted to remove the temptation of using them again. although suspected of lying by rhodes, nebula vouches for her father, as he is never a liar. surprised by the affirmation, thanos reconsiders his torturous treatment of his daughter, but he is then immediately beheaded by thor. although the mad titan is dead, they have failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his victims and have no choice but to accept defeat. five years pass, and the surviving population have yet to cope with their losses. rogers now runs a support group for people to try help them come to terms with what happened. stark and pepper potts are now married and are living in a remote cabin with their daughter morgan. in san francisco, scott lang escapes from the quantum realm when a rat activates controls left behind by the van dyne family before they vanished. lang wanders through the disheveled city and realizes something terrible has happened. he approaches the wall of the vanished, a massive memorial containing the names of everyone in the city who vanished in the snap. he frantically searches it hoping to not find cassie's name, only to find his own (as no-one remaining knew what happened to him). scott rushes to cassie's house and finds that she is now five years older and a teenager. father and daughter tearfully reunite. at the avengers compound, romanoff now commands the the team as they perform various assignments. rhodes informs her of a recent mexican cartel massacre carried out by the still grief-stricken barton, expressing his concern over how far their former comrade had fallen. barton has been on an assassination rampage that's taken him around the world. lang arrives at the compound and reveals to romanoff and rogers that although five years had passed, he only spent five hours in the realm. he proposes that they could find a way to exploit the realm's time-bending nature to travel into the past and retrieve the stones from different times. but since the three have no knowledge of quantum physics, they seek out stark. initially declining to help them, as he believes it would mean putting his daughter morgan in danger of being erased from existence, stark later decides to spring into action after coming across an old photo of him and his late protégé peter parker. he successfully develops a time-space gps device based on an inverted möbius strip. stark consults with potts on his new discovery, who encourages him to do what's right for everyone else. meanwhile, the other avengers recruit banner, who merged his intellect with hulk's physique, to run time travel tests on lang using the quantum tunnel housed in his van. the experiment does not turn out as expected, as lang constantly shifts between different ages. afterward, stark arrives at the facility with the gps and returns rogers' shield to him, signifying their reconciliation, but makes it clear he won't sacrifice his daughter to undo what thanos did. rogers agrees. the remaining avengers begin to regroup. as nebula returns to new york, banner and rocket travel to new asgard and recruit thor, who has become an overweight, depressed and lazy drunkard, traumatized with his perceived failure to stop thanos. romanoff goes to tokyo and finds barton, who has massacred a group of yakuza as part of his vengeful crusade against criminals who survived the snap. rocket and stark build a time machine, while barton volunteers to submit himself for a test run into the past. grabbing a baseball mitt from his homestead, he successfully carries it back to the present as evidence that their plan works. in the past, he hears the voice of his daughter lila but returns to the future before he can interact with his family. the avengers plan out their time heist, using points from their past to pinpoint locations for the infinity stones: romanoff realizes that the space, mind, and time stones can be found in 2012 new york. the reality stone is in 2013 on asgard, and the power and soul stones on morag and vormir respectively can be found in 2014. they split into three teams and travel back in time to begin their missions, mindful that they only have a finite amount of pym particles since hank pym also perished in the snap. rogers, stark, banner and lang arrive in an alternate 2012 in the midst of the battle of new york. banner approaches the new york sanctum and finds the ancient one, who refuses to lend the time stone to him. however, she relents after learning that doctor strange had surrendered it to thanos in the future, knowing strange wouldn't have done so if there wasn't a grave reason. at stark tower, lang and stark attempt to steal the tesseract, but loses it to loki, who uses it to teleport away. rogers obtains the scepter from strike possession by feigning hydra affiliation, but is forced to fight his 2012 self who confuses him for loki. after defeating his past self, rogers rendezvous with stark and lang. with only enough pym particles for one more trip each, stark and rogers decide to go back further to camp lehigh to an alternate 1970, where they have another shot at obtaining the tesseract and more pym particles. lang is left with the scepter to return to the present day. at the s.h.i.e.l.d. base, rogers stealthily obtains the particles from hank pym, but runs into peggy carter's office while evading security. he tearfully watches her as she works in her office. meanwhile, stark encounters his father howard after obtaining the tesseract. with the latter's wife maria expecting a baby, tony (under the guise of \"howard potts\") offers parenting advice, saying that the good times he had with his father are all that mattered. before they part ways, tony hugs his alternate father, having finally obtained his closure. arriving on asgard in an alternate 2013, thor experiences a panic attack after seeing his mother frigga, recalling this is the day of her demise. rocket encourages him to settle his grief and help him extract the aether from jane foster's body, but thor runs away, leaving the raccoon to do it himself. thor unsuccessfully attempts to hide from frigga and runs into her, who knows that her alternate son is from the future. sharing a talk, frigga lectures her son on the importance of failure, advising him to follow his own path rather than try and live up to what he was supposed to be. thor attempts to warn his mother about her impending death, but she silences him. as rocket returns with the aether in hand, thor shares one last hug with frigga before reaching out to retrieve mjølnir, finding that he remains worthy of wielding the hammer. in an alternate 2014, barton and romanoff board the benatar for vormir, while nebula and rhodes remain on morag and wait for peter quill to arrive and lead them to the orb's chamber. they knock quill out and collect the stone, but when the two attempt to travel back, nebula is left behind when her memories are entangled with those of her past self. the thanos of that time uses the link to see into the future, learning that the same humans who had foiled his 2012 invasion are returning to reverse his ultimate victory. determined to know more, thanos captures nebula as she attempts to warn barton and romanoff of his newfound involvement. past nebula confronts her future self and collects her gps device and pym particles, handing it over to her father. meanwhile, barton and romanoff arrive on vormir. they meet red skull, who informs them that the sacrifice of a loved one must be carried out in order for one to retrieve the stone. barton laughs at the concept, but romanoff deduces that it is indeed the truth, as thanos had murdered his daughter gamora there in their time. understanding the severity of the situation, the two struggle to decide who should give their life for the cause; while barton insists he should do it due to the carnage he left behind in the wake of his grief, romanoff declares that her life's work has led her to this moment. as they dash to the cliff, they wrestle to keep each other away from sacrificing themselves. ultimately, romanoff makes the jump and dies, leaving the soul stone with the grief-stricken barton. the avengers return to the present day. reeling from the loss of one of their own, they realize that her death cannot be undone, and that their efforts to save the universe must not leave her death in vain. they construct a new gauntlet using tony's mark suit technology and load the six stones onto it. thor volunteers to perform the snap, but banner steps in, saying he's the only one strong enough to withstand the stones' radiation, which is gamma in nature, similar to his own. while severely scarring his arm, he successfully snaps his fingers and brings the victims of the snap back to life. elsewhere, past nebula - who traveled to the present in place of her future self - opens the avengers' time portal, allowing thanos to bring his ship, the sanctuary ii, forward from 2014. the avengers barely have time to celebrate their success when the ship abruptly opens fire on the compound with a barrage of missiles, reducing the facility to rubble. as thanos sends past nebula to retrieve the stones, her future self reveals to gamora that their relationship in the future became one of friendship and more. gamora decides to join nebula to stop her father. meanwhile, rhodes, rocket and banner are trapped in a flooding area under the rubble, prompting lang to come to their rescue. barton lands next to the gauntlet in the sewer, which is infested with outriders. after escaping them, he unknowingly passes the apparatus to past nebula, who is then confronted by gamora and nebula; the latter kills her past self once she threatens her sister. stark, rogers and thor confront thanos on the ground, who intends to rebuild the entire universe using the stones, a universe where the new living beings will live in peace without knowledge of the past. after stark and thor are overpowered in the ensuing fight, rogers wields mjølnir against the time-displaced titan. however, thanos eventually defeats rogers, severely injuring him and nearly destroys his shield, hacking viciously away at it with his sword. thanos summons the rest of his army, which include the chitauri and the black order, to lay siege on earth. just as rogers prepares to face them alone, he hears sam wilson contacting him through his earpiece. a series of sling ring portals appear behind him. the masters of the mystic arts have arrived with reinforcements from kamar-taj, wakanda, contraxia and new asgard, along with the avengers' resurrected allies from wakanda, titan and san francisco. lang, growing to giant size, retrieves banner, rhodes and rocket from the flooded depths of the destroyed compound. with the scales now balanced, rogers calls for the avengers to assemble and leads his allies into the battle for the fate of the universe. banner tells barton that they must get the stones back to their respective times and away from thanos. with their main time machine destroyed in the initial attack, their only other option is the van; ant-man and wasp jump to hot-wire the dead vehicle. as thanos' forces close in on barton. he passes the gauntlet onto black panther. as thanos prepares to charge at t'challa, he suddenly finds his path blocked by a vengeful wanda maximoff, seeking revenge for his 2018 self's murder of vision. as wanda engages thanos, t'challa runs, only to become entrapped by ebony maw. seeing t'challa's predicament, spider-man swoops in and snatches the gauntlet. meanwhile, wanda's attacks leave thanos at her mercy, as she effortlessly breaks his sword and lifts him into the air while ripping chunks of armor from his body. in order to escape her grasp, thanos orders another missile barrage from sanctuary ii (against corvus glaive's protests) that deals great damage to both sides. one of the missiles takes out a dam, forcing doctor strange out of the fight to prevent the battlefield from flooding. suddenly, sanctuary ii redirects its fire to a target arriving from outer space. it is carol danvers, who comes to single-handedly destroy the warship. retrieving the gauntlet from parker, she enlists the aid of her fellow female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated van. however, thanos uses his sword to destroy the vehicle and the quantum portal. with the gauntlet in thanos' reach, stark, rogers, thor and danvers make their last stand to keep it out of his hands. however, he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and equip the gauntlet. strange signals stark with one shaking finger that this is the one future that ends in their victory. determined, stark dashes at thanos one last time, grappling with the gauntlet on the titan's hand, but he is knocked aside as the titan snaps his fingers. nothing happens, as the stones have been stolen by stark and transferred onto his hand with the suit's nanotech. with the very being that has haunted him for the past eleven years now at his mercy and declaring \"i am ironman!\", stark snaps his own fingers in a large flash of white light. thanos, realizing he's been beaten, watches in horror as his own forces crumble to dust in front of him, only to meet that same fate soon after. stark is mortally wounded from his usage of the stones, and is greeted by rhodes, parker and potts as he lays dying. potts assures her husband that they are going to be alright, and allows him to rest. stark's arc reactor then permanently shuts off, potts giving him one last kiss. rogers and thor mournfully watch at a distance. the mad titan's final defeat and the return of the vanished calls for celebrations all around the world, including in wakanda and san francisco. parker reunites at school with his best friend ned. lang watches the celebration with hope and cassie. at stark's funeral, he leaves a final holographic message for his family and closest friends, including a heartfelt goodbye for morgan. stark's mark i arc reactor is set adrift in the lake outside their cabin, with the avengers and their allies in attendance, including those who had past grievances with stark, such as the pym family, wanda, and bucky barnes. outside new asgard, thor, following his mother's advice, names valkyrie as the new ruler while he abdicates to join the guardians of the galaxy. meanwhile, rogers prepares to go back in time to return the stones and mjølnir, bidding goodbye to barnes. as banner is unable to bring him back when prompted, barnes alerts sam wilson to the presence of an elderly man nearby. it is an aged rogers, who had chosen to remain in the past and live out a full life with peggy carter, a fact he gently refuses to reveal to wilson. he presents wilson with a new shield, passing the mantle of captain america on to him. in the past, peggy and steve dance together in the living room of a suburban house to their song \"it's been a long, long time.\""

        "text": "&quot;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...&quot;<br/><br/>Pre review:<br/><br/>Its writing started in January 1973, &quot;eight hours a day, five days a week&quot;, George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.<br/><br/>Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was &quot;too strange&quot;.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas&#39; genius. And that&#39;s how Star Wars became a reality.<br/><br/>The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn&#39;t stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...<br/><br/>One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick&#39;s revolutionary masterpiece: &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.<br/><br/>The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer&#39;s desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel &quot;in distress&quot;, a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.<br/><br/>The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.<br/><br/>The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic &quot;filtered look&quot; so he kept changing key lights for a &quot;flashing&quot; effect. He used a loose, &quot;nervous&quot; frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.&quot; This is authenticity is reflected in it&#39;s most iconic shot: the &#39;Binary Sunset&#39; sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke&#39;s character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.<br/><br/>Books such as &quot;The hero with a thousand faces&quot; by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa&#39;s storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang&#39;s it&#39;s iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it&#39;s soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.<br/><br/>10/10"

The powerful and dramatic first half, contrasting with the cheerful and humorous second, gives a very complete and versatile film.<br/><br/>Characters - there&#39;s nothing to say here. Darth Vader - who can compete with him in popularity among villains except the Joker? The &quot;kind&quot; characters of the film - Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and others - are known to almost everyone. And for good reason!<br/><br/>Yes, the graphics here are still a bit weak, but after such thoughts, look at the release date - 1977, and then remember the atmosphere and elaboration of this picture and think about whether you gave the right claims to this story?<br/><br/>And the same &quot;old&quot; special effects are still very cool for those years and the eyes are not too sore.<br/><br/>The only thing is that because of the possibilities of that time, Darth Vader does not look as cool as in new films and animations, and fights on light swords not best. But, unfortunately, these were the conditions before.<br/><br/>George Lucas came up with an interesting idea - to start the franchise with the 4th film. But there were conditions for that - filming the first three episodes was impossible at that time.<br/><br/>In general, this is the beginning of a great saga that is worth watching, it is not for nothing that it is considered a classic and revered by more than one generation.<br/><br/>My rating is 9/10. Great!"

        "text": "What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?<br/><br/>I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.<br/><br/>I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother&#39;s dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I&#39;m still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I&#39;m a fan, and I don&#39;t care what other people say about Episodes 1 &amp; 2. I don&#39;t even mind the &quot;prequel&quot; factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.<br/><br/>See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn&#39;t exactly &quot;sell out,&quot; he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.<br/><br/>The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you&#39;d expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most &quot;princess&quot; types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.<br/><br/>And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han&#39;s, was exemplary. It&#39;s not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn&#39;t happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones&#39;s voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels&#39; C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.<br/><br/>The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie&#39;s success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.<br/><br/>The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone&#39;s greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won&#39;t be redundant beyond what I have already said.<br/><br/>However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi &quot;storm troopers.&quot; While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.<br/><br/>And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie&#39;s vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.<br/><br/>This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don&#39;t have the heart to rate it. <br/><br/>But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.<br/><br/>The Fiend :."

        "text": "I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.<br/><br/>Of course, I also knew that the film wasn&#39;t perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas&#39; budget just didn&#39;t quite go far enough, or where there just wasn&#39;t enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.<br/><br/>For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer&#39;s sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn&#39;t look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse &quot;When you have to shoot, shoot, don&#39;t talk!&quot;. Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you&#39;d have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.<br/><br/>Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will."

Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good."

        "text": "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.<br/><br/>The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire&#39;s space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want&#39;s them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.<br/><br/>Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.<br/><br/>Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.<br/><br/>I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke&#39;s X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan&#39;s spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.<br/><br/>I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.<br/><br/>Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70&#39;s film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan &quot;Ben&quot; Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan &quot;Ben&quot; Kenobi he is excellent. <br/><br/>Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get&#39;s a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.<br/><br/>R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed."

But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.<br/><br/>The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.<br/><br/>This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies.

        "text": "Though now known as &quot;Episode IV-A New Hope,&quot; for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in &#39;77, this will always be the first &quot;Star Wars.&quot; We will always think of it as just &quot;Star Wars&quot; - plain &amp; simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old &#39;Ben&#39;), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO &amp; R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you&#39;d seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn&#39;t possible. But they&#39;d been there before in our minds. We&#39;d read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We&#39;d dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; from 1956 came close, and then there were the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate &#39;em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.<br/><br/>I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I&#39;d been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn&#39;t disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can&#39;t wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just &#39;movie.&#39; You can&#39;t wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It&#39;s a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; is superior - I must disagree).<br/><br/>The one character you really can&#39;t wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can&#39;t wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he&#39;s simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He&#39;s at his best here where there&#39;s still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.<br/><br/>This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it&#39;s this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began &amp; ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he&#39;s perfect in the role. Fisher&#39;s main surprise is that she&#39;s not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader..."

      "amid a galactic civil war, rebel alliance is operating from a hidden base and have been securing victories against the evil galactic empire.\nrebel alliance spies have stolen plans to the death star, a colossal, armored space station built by the tyrannical galactic empire that is capable of destroying entire planets.\nimperial senator leia organa (carrie fisher) of alderaan, secretly a rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, and is rushing home to the rebel's secret base. the plans can save the people and restore freedom to the galaxy. leia's ship is intercepted and boarded by an imperial star destroyer under the command of the ruthless darth vader (james earl jones). darth vader can access \"the force\" and inflict intolerable pain on his enemies, without engaging them in battle. due to the mask that he wears, darth vader emits a wheezing noise when he breathes.\nthe empire ships carry the heavily armed stormtroopers, which make up the bulk of the empire army.\nleia is taken prisoner, but before the capture, leia inserts the plans in her droid r2-d2, along with a message. the droids r2-d2 (kenny baker) and c-3po (anthony daniels) escape with the plans on an escape pod, crashing on the nearby planet of tatooine.\ndarth vader sends his stormtroopers after them to retrieve the plans. the droids are captured by jawa traders who electrocute r2-d2, and sell them to moisture farmers owen (phil brown) and beru lars (shelagh fraser) and their nephew, luke skywalker (mark hamill). owen needed droids who understand the binary language of moisture vaporators. while c3po is a protocol droid, he is trained in the language of load filters, similar to vaporators. he can also speak bocce. c3po convinces luke to take r2-d2 as well. owen asks luke to clean up both droids before dinner.\nwhile luke is cleaning r2-d2, he discovers a recording of leia requesting help from a former ally named obi-wan kenobi (alec guinness). luke is interested in the rebellion and wants to learn more about it. r2-d2 says that the message is a private one for obi-wan and that r2-d2 is his property. obi-wan lives on tatooine. luke knows of a ben kenobi, an old hermit, who lives beyond the dune sea.\nluke - who hopes to leave home for training at a nearby imperial military academy to become a space pilot - leaves the room angrily to return to cleaning the droids. luke's aunt beru tells owen that luke is too much like his father to remain with them, but owen holds out hope that luke's desire for adventure will subside - and expresses a fear that luke is too much like his father... suggesting that owen may know something of anakin's terrible past.\nmeanwhile, the stormtroopers land on tatooine and follow the tracks made by the jawa trader's ship. r2-d2 goes missing. luke tells 3po that it's too late to look for r2 because of the dangerous sand people (also called tusken raiders) in the area, and that they will set out first thing in the morning to go look for him.\nluke and c3po go on luke's landspeeder to look for r2-d2 and catch up with it. r2-d2 is adamant that it needs to get to obi-wan. luke is attacked by sand people. he is rescued by obi-wan, an elderly hermit. luke addresses him as ben, and says that the droid has been looking for obi-wan. ben says that he is obi-wan but hasn't been addressed as that in a long time. obi-wan tells luke about his past as one of the jedi knights, former peacekeepers of the galactic republic (for over a thousand generations), who drew mystical abilities from \"the force\" but were hunted to near-extinction by the empire. obi-wan explains that a jedi receives his power from the force, an energy field that is created by all living beings that \"surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together.\" but there is also a dark side to the force, which draws power from negative emotions and baser impulses.\nluke learns that his father, also a jedi, fought alongside obi-wan during the clone wars until vader, obi-wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the force and murdered him. then he became the dark lord of the sith, the most feared enforcer of the emperor. in this capacity, he proceeded to hunt down his former comrades, and the jedi order is now all but extinct. luke had been told by his uncle that his father anakin was a navigator on a spice freighter.\nobi-wan offers luke his father's old light-saber (an energy sword), the signature weapon of the jedi. r2-d2 plays leia's full message, in which she begs obi-wan to take the death star plans to alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. luke initially declines obi-wan's offer to accompany him to alderaan and learn the ways of the force, but he is left with no choice after imperial stormtroopers murder his family while searching for the droids. seeking a way off the planet, luke and obi-wan travel to the spaceport of mos eisley. obi-wan uses the force to hypnotize the imperial stormtroopers and provide safe passage through the city. they reach a tavern which is frequented by several space freighter pilots, who would be willing to transport anything for the right fee. obi-wan makes contact with a wookie named chewbacca. they hire han solo (harrison ford) (for 10,000 credits), a smuggler indebted to local mobster jabba the hutt, for a passage to alderaan. luke knows that for that kind of money, they can buy their own ship. han claims that his ship the millenium falcon made the kessel run in 12 parsecs and can outrun imperial star-ships. obi-wan offers to pay 2000 credits upfront and 15,000 credits upon arrival. they agree to meet in bay 94.\nhan hangs back to take care of their bar tab and is stopped by greedo (paul blake), a bounty hunter working for feared crime lord jabba desilijic tiure, aka: jabba the hutt. apparently, jabba had hired han to transport a shipment of glitterstim spice (an illegal narcotic), but han had to dump the shipment due to an unexpected imperial boarding. as greedo points a blaster pistol at solo, han insists that he has the 8,000 credits he needs to cover the loss. greedo suggests that solo give it to him as a bribe not to turn him over to jabba, forcing han to admit that he doesn't actually have the money yet. solo quietly removes his heavy pistol under the table, and pre-emptively fires and kills him. on his way out, han throws the bartender a few coins, apologizing for \"the mess\" he left. at the docking bay, han is confronted by jabba the hutt. jabba expresses frustration over greedo's death and reminds han that he cannot spare who fail or cross him, lest he appear weak. han insists that he will soon have enough money to pay off his debt, with interest of 15%, he just needs more time. jabba reluctantly agrees but warns han that this is his last chance. luke sells his landspeeder to raise money for their initial payment to captain solo. they head to the docking bay. luke is worried to discover that the falcon is a 60-year-old, run-down yt-1300 freighter, but han assures him that he has made extensive modifications to ensure that she can run rings around any modern capital ship.\npursued by stormtroopers (who were informed by local spies about the location of the droids), luke, obi-wan, r2-d2, and c-3po flee tatooine with han and his wookiee copilot, chewbacca (peter mayhew), on their ship, the millennium falcon. they are pursued by an imperial cruiser, but han manages to jump to light speed before they can be caught. a jump through hyper-space is dangerous as with the wrong calculations one could travel through a star or a supernova and end up dead. meanwhile, aboard the death star, commander grand moff tarkin tells his commanders that the emperor has dissolved the imperial senate permanently, and with that all remnants of the old republic. regional governors now have direct control over their territories. the empire plans to use the death star to breed fear in the galaxy but are afraid that the rebels might find a weakness in its defenses and exploit it. darth vader is given the task to locate the rebel fortress before the death star is operational.\ndarth vader starts to interrogate leia regarding the location of the rebel base. leia resists the mind probe and gives nothing to darth vader. as the death star becomes operational, moff turns it towards alderaan, where leia was headed in her diplomatic ship in the first place. before the falcon reaches alderaan, the death star commander grand moff tarkin (peter cushing) has the planet obliterated by the station's gigantic laser. moff wants to demonstrate the power of the death star on leia's home planet, even though she begs that alderaan is peaceful and has no weapons. moff would have spared the planet, if leia reveals the name of the rebel base. leia names dantooine, but moff destroys alderaan regardless as dantoonie is too far away to make an effective demonstration. obi-wan senses a disturbance in the force, the moment alderaan is destroyed. on their way, obi-wan starts training luke on the use of the lightsaber. han does not believe in the force. obi-wan demonstrates the existence of the force when luke is able to defeat a training bot with all his senses blocked, but by plugging into the force. upon arrival, the falcon is captured by the death star's (which is the size of a small moon) tractor beam. the ship is identified as the same as the one that escaped the mos eisley and darth vader believes that they were bringing the plans of the death star to alderaan. the group escapes inside the death star (by hiding under the floorboards of the ship and making it look like they jettisoned from the ship using the escape pods) and infiltrates the station. r2-d2 hacks into the computer systems and figures out the schematics of the death star.\nas obi-wan leaves to disable the tractor beam, r2-d2 locates leia on the ship. luke persuades han and chewbacca to help him rescue leia, who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the rebel base. luke says that leia is the one in the message and so must be someone important. han is only convinced when luke says that leia is a princess and is likely to be rich and will rewards han handsomely.\nhan and luke disguise as stormtroopers with chewie as their prisoner, as they get to leia's location. vader can sense a presence on the death star, that he has not felt since the presence of his previous master. he reports to moff that obi-wan is on the death star, which moff cannot believe as the jedi are extinct. darth vader follows the force and finds obi-wan on the death star.\nafter disabling the tractor beam, obi-wan sacrifices himself in a light-saber duel against vader. obi-wan vanishes into thin air, before darth vader's light-saber hits him. luke and han reach leia's floor and rescue her from her cell, after dispatching the security. leia comes along when she hears obi-wan is with the group. as reinforcements arrive, the group is forced to take a different route back through the garbage chute. but they drop into a garbage masher which starts to close in. c3po manages to pick up a communications unit when stormtroopers come into the control room, but do not recognize them as the escapee droids.\nusing the communications unit, c3po gets in contact with luke and with r2-d2 in the control room, they disable the garbage masher. eventually, the 2 groups reach the hangar where the falcon is being kept, after fighting more stormtroopers.\nobi-wan's sacrifice allows the rest of the group to escape the death star (when a voice from the sky instructs luke to escape). the falcon fights off the tie fighters sent after them.\nusing a tracking device on the falcon, the empire locates the rebel base on the 4th moon around planet yavin. leia informs han that r2-d2 is carrying the technical specifications of death star. for a moment it looks like both luke and han are interested in leia. analysis of the captured death star schematics reveals a hidden weakness in a small exhaust port (2 meters wide) leading directly to the station's reactor. a precise hit will start a chain reaction that will destroy the station. after collecting his reward for rescuing leia, han leaves the rebels to pay off jabba. the rebels plan their attack on the death star, as they detect its approach towards their moon. luke joins the rebels' x-wing squadron of 30 ships (with r2-d2 installed on his own x-wing fighter) in a desperate attack against the approaching death star which will be within range in 15 minutes. in the ensuing battle, vader leads a squadron of tie fighters against the rebels, and they suffer heavy losses. vader personally thwarts several rebel attempts to hit the exhaust port with photon torpedoes. luke is on the last run, before the death star will be in range of the rebel base. han and chewbacca unexpectedly return to aid them in the falcon, knocking vader's ship off course before he can shoot luke down. guided by the voice of obi-wan's spirit, luke uses the force (and switches off his on-board computer) to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, causing the death star to explode moments before it can fire on the rebel base. obi-wan's spirit reminds luke that the force will always be with him.\nin a triumphant ceremony, leia awards luke and han medals for their heroism."

I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we&#39;d get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act&#39;s Maggie Smith, James Bond 007&#39;s Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars&#39; Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"

      {
        "summary": "Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book",
        "text": "I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like &quot;The Phantom Menace,&quot; I&#39;ve had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was &quot;How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?&quot; rather than &quot;How entertaining is this film overall?&quot; I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I&#39;ll never know how I&#39;d have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.<br/><br/>Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I&#39;d have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children&#39;s movies, like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Mary Poppins,&quot; are so successful partly because they&#39;re so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children&#39;s movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they&#39;re based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children&#39;s book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That&#39;s why it&#39;s easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.<br/><br/>As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don&#39;t have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It&#39;s as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don&#39;t. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that&#39;s exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry&#39;s two best friends are flawless.<br/><br/>I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children&#39;s delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry&#39;s swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire.&quot; Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors&#39; faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.<br/><br/>But much is left out. Harry&#39;s caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren&#39;t in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--&quot;Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers&quot;--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn&#39;t as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.<br/><br/>Not that I&#39;m blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.<br/><br/>The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling&#39;s series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary &quot;muggle&quot; world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you&#39;re left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.<br/><br/>Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I&#39;ve never seen happen before, though I don&#39;t go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn&#39;t have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn&#39;t really trying to get involved in the movie&#39;s story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.<br/><br/>The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry&#39;s anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he&#39;s kicked out, he&#39;ll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn&#39;t tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry&#39;s adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn&#39;t enough tying them all together.<br/><br/>What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children&#39;s series, but it doesn&#39;t entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book&#39;s delights to the screen. In its current form, it&#39;s almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling&#39;s series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing."

Was I ever wrong? <br/><br/>J.K. Rowling&#39;s novel was brilliantly taken from book to screen. The acting, directing and especially the special effects were tremendously awesome. Director Chris Columbus did a superb job with the direction, I was surprised he didn&#39;t get an Academy Award nomination. The acting was too, excellent, especially from the experienced actors like Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape. Truly one of his best performances.<br/><br/>A great adaptation of a very popular book, a fine example of cinema."

        "text": "There&#39;s nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone&#39;s safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone.<br/><br/>I&#39;m sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they&#39;ll tell their grandkids about, but I&#39;ll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams&#39;s perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams&#39;s numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There&#39;s something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the &quot;magical&quot; qualities might not all be credited to the music, it&#39;s certainly one of them.<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you&#39;re a ten-year-old kid who doesn&#39;t fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you&#39;ll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren&#39;t perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they&#39;re looking at things that were added in post production!<br/><br/>Usually, in kids&#39; movies, there&#39;s a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they&#39;re watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you&#39;ll see a host of familiar faces as &quot;guest stars&quot; but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they&#39;re so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can&#39;t imagine they&#39;ve had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn&#39;t immediately attribute the word &quot;earwax&quot; to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as &quot;Maggie Smith cats&quot;, mumble &quot;Shouldn&#39;t have said that,&quot; when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?<br/><br/>First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling&#39;s fantasy world, there&#39;s so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott&#39;s Every Flavor Beans.<br/><br/>Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn&#39;t immediately conjure the name &quot;Fluffy,&quot; chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don&#39;t laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don&#39;t know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you&#39;re missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie."

        "summary": "The Magic Comes To Life!",
        "text": "Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone,&#39; directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn&#39;t approve of her own sister-- Harry&#39;s mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry&#39;s father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley&#39;s door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,&#39; a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it&#39;s a journey you will never forget.<br/><br/>\tWhat a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you&#39;re about to have a singular experience; and you&#39;re right. Because you&#39;ve just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it&#39;s magic.<br/><br/>\tEven having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.<br/><br/>\tAlso turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,&#39; with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.<br/><br/>\tIt&#39;s obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it&#39;s a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid&#39;s heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.  <br/><br/>\tThe additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling&#39;s imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone&#39; is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer&#39;s stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there&#39;s a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10."

Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!"

        "text": "Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don&#39;t know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that&#39;s a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there&#39;s wonderful art direction and set design, and there&#39;s some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it&#39;s still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out."

        "text": "Not being a reader of the Harry Potter books, I came to the first Harry Potter movie with a totally open mind. There seems to be those who love the book but hate the film; those that love both; and even a few who hate both! Having watched Harry Potter And The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, I must confess that I&#39;m not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. This strikes me as solid but unremarkable, totally overlong but fairly diverting fare.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is left as a baby at the house of his relatives, the Dursleys. Later we learn that his parents were magicians killed by a dark sorcerer, and he has been hidden away for his own protection until he is older. Eventually the time comes for Harry to discover his destiny. He is tracked down by the friendly giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and sent to Hogwarts, a special school of Witchcraft and Wizardry for youngsters with magical prowess. Everyone at Hogwarts, the fellow pupils and the teachers – seems to know about Harry&#39;s past, even though he himself knows barely any of it. Harry befriends two other first year students – Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) – and begins to learn the art of wizardry from various eccentric teachers. Things take a darker turn when the three young magicians begin to suspect that Voldemort, an evil figure from Harry&#39;s past, is trying to regain his once-great power and strength by obtaining the Philosopher&#39;s Stone, a powerful object hidden somewhere at the school.<br/><br/>The film is not particularly well-acted, with the child stars coming across as if they are carrying out a reading rehearsal, and too many star names (Julie Walters, John Hurt, John Cleese, Zoe Wanamaker) hamming it up like mad in cameo roles. At least the main adult roles – taken by the likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Richard Harris – are played with a degree of experience and finesse. There are some splendid visuals in parts, though the effects are not so impressive during the much-hyped Quidditch sequence. The most disappointing thing for me is the long and laborious build-up, which leads to a somewhat flat final confrontation (I am reliably informed by those in the know that this film&#39;s climax is intentionally brief and aborted, and links to developments in the later films). Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone is a reasonable watch, but I&#39;m hoping for something more as the series progresses."

They had thought provoking writing, likeable characters, and compelling world building. Then I saw this movie adaptation of The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone (The Philosopher&#39;s Stone in the UK) back in theaters and loved it. It&#39;s not a perfect film I&#39;ll admit, but it&#39;s a very good start to a successful fantasy movie franchise.<br/><br/>Sure, it&#39;s a bit overlong and the child performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, while not terrible by any means, could have used some fixing though they did get better as the later movies progressed.<br/><br/>Everything else still holds up. The visual effects/cinematography are beautiful to look at, the directing from Chris Columbus is great, the make up designs are well built, and the music score from John Williams is enchanting and haunting especially Hedwig&#39;s Theme. Not to mention the supporting actors are great with Robbie Coltrane as Harris and the late actors Alan Rickman and Richard Harris as Severus Snape and Professor Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s a very good start to the successful fantasy movie franchise after 20 years.

On his eleventh birthday Hagrid arrives at a hut on the sea-locked island where the Dursleys have fled, delivers Harry's Hogwarts acceptance letter and brings him into the wizarding world. In Diagon Alley Harry learns he is famous, buys school supplies, and discovers his parents were wizards killed by Voldemort. On the Hogwarts Express he befriends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and meets Hermione Granger (Emma Watson); the Sorting Hat places all three in Gryffindor while Draco Malfoy is sorted into Slytherin. At Hogwarts Harry shows skill as a Seeker and joins the Gryffindor Quidditch team. The trio discover a three-headed dog, Fluffy, guarding a trapdoor and later learn from Hagrid that Nicolas Flamel is associated with a mysterious magical object, the Sorcerer’s (Philosopher’s) Stone, which produces the Elixir of Life. Strange incidents follow: a troll in the castle (which Harry and Ron fight to save Hermione), Harry's broom is jinxed during a Quidditch match, and Harry sees what he believes are suspicious interactions between Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). Harry receives an invisibility cloak that once belonged to his father and uses it to research Flamel in the restricted section with Hermione and Ron. In the Forbidden Forest Harry witnesses a hooded figure drinking unicorn blood; the centaur Firenze tells him the figure is Voldemort. Concluding that someone is trying to steal the Stone to return Voldemort to power, Harry, Ron and Hermione break into the guarded chamber: they bypass a series of magical protections (Devil's Snare, flying keys, a life-sized wizard's chess game) together until Harry goes alone into the final chamber. There Harry confronts Professor Quirrell and finds Voldemort living as a weak, parasitic presence on the back of Quirrell's head. Voldemort/Quirrell attempts to seize the Stone, but when Quirrell touches Harry he burns and collapses because Harry carries his mother Lily's sacrificial protection; Voldemort flees, abandoning Quirrell, who dies. Harry loses consciousness and wakes in the hospital wing where Dumbledore explains the protection and reveals that Nicolas Flamel and the Stone will be destroyed to prevent misuse. At the end-of-year feast Dumbledore awards last-minute house points to Harry, Ron and Hermione, delivering the House Cup to Gryffindor.",

      "lord voldemort, an evil and powerful dark wizard, has just been defeated. when he tried to kill a 1 year-old boy, harry potter (daniel radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, voldemort having killed his parents, lily and james potter. professors dumbledore (richard harris) and mcgonagall (dame maggie smith) and gamekeeper hagrid (robbie coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent muggle (non-magical) relatives, the dursley family, who take him in. harry's relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years. shortly before harry's 11th birthday, he receives a letter. his outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it. the sender does not give up, and the dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. soon, his uncle vernon (richard griffiths), with harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. that night (which happens to be before harry's birthday), he is visited by hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. with hagrid holding the dursleys at bay, harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. the next day harry and hagrid head to diagon alley in london (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous wizarding pub the leaky cauldron). harry enters the wizarding world for the first time, learns to his surprise that he is famous, and meets the new hogwarts defense against the dark arts teacher, professor quirrell (ian hart). he takes the train to hogwarts from platform nine and three-quarters, befriending ron weasley (rupert grint), and meeting hermione granger (emma watson), a muggle-born witch. upon arrival, the sorting hat places harry, ron and hermione in gryffindor house. draco malfoy (tom felton), an arrogant and elitist student, gets placed in slytherin. at the end of their first week at hogwarts, harry and ron discover that gringotts, the wizarding bank, was broken into and a vault that harry and hagrid visited had been the subject of the robbery. later, harry discovers he has a talent for riding broomsticks, and is recruited to join gryffindor's quidditch team as a seeker, much to malfoy's displeasure. harry, ron, hermione explore hogwarts late at night and accidentally stumble across the door to a corridor. a three-headed dog, christened fluffy by hagrid, guards a trapdoor. on halloween, quirrell informs everyone that a troll has entered the castle; harry and ron fight the troll to save hermione, who is trapped in the girls' bathroom, and the three become best friends.\nat harry's first quidditch match, harry's broom becomes possessed, nearly knocking him off. hermione sees professor severus snape (alan rickman), the sinister potions master and head of slytherin house, staring at harry and mouthing words, making her believe that snape has caused the broom to misbehave with a dark curse. hoping to save harry, hermione sets snape's robes on fire, distracting him and others and allowing harry to survive. at christmas, harry receives an invisibility cloak, once belonging to his father, which renders its wearer invisible. harry uses it to explore the restricted section in the library to research information on nicolas flamel, a name hagrid lets slip when confronted about his knowledge of fluffy. eventually, harry learns that \"nicolas flamel is the only known maker of the sorcerer's stone, which produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal.\" harry sees snape trying to get information from quirrell about getting past fluffy; quirrell says he does not know what he's talking about. harry, ron, and hermione are sure that snape is trying to steal the philosopher's stone in order to restore lord voldemort to power. while at hagrid's hut, the trio discover a dragon egg hagrid was nursing in a fire. later the egg hatches a norwegian ridgeback dragon, and hagrid decides to call him \"norbert\". the friends are nervous for hagrid, since dragon breeding had long been outlawed in the wizarding world, and hagrid had something of a reckless nature, who has long since nursed a strong desire for a dragon. finally, harry, ron, and hermione are able to convince hagrid to let norbert go live with other dragons of his kind in romania. harry, hermione, ron and draco are caught out late at night, and are forced to serve detention with hagrid in the forbidden forest. harry sees a hooded figure drink the blood of an injured unicorn, which makes harry's forehead scar start burning. firenze, a centaur, tells harry that it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn, let alone drink its blood. he also tells harry that unicorn blood will keep one alive, and that the hooded figure is in fact voldemort. harry, hermione and ron find out that hagrid has told a hooded stranger how to get past fluffy, and they believe the theft of the stone is imminent. rushing to finally confide in professor dumbledore their news, they meet professor mcgonagall, who is shocked to find out how much they knew about the stone but reassures them all the same that it is safe in the castle. she also tells them that dumbledore has been sent away on an important mission by the ministry of magic. positive that dumbledore's summons was a red herring to take professor dumbledore away from hogwarts, the trio make plans to thwart snape's theft of the stone. they set out to reach the stone first, navigating the security system set up by the school's staff, which is a series of complex magical challenges. the three make it through together until finally, harry must enter the inner chamber alone. there he finds that professor quirrell, not snape, is attempting to steal the stone. realizing that snape was trying to protect him from harm all along, harry confronts quirrell and survives a second encounter with lord voldemort, who has possessed quirrell and appears as a ghastly face on the back of quirrell's head. quirrell crumbles when he touches harry's skin, and harry passes out because of his close proximity to lord voldemort. voldemort then pitilessly abandons quirrell, who dies in the aftermath of his possession. harry wakes up in the hospital wing. dumbledore reveals to harry that harry's mother died to protect harry as an infant. her pure, loving sacrifice provides harry with an ancient magical protection from voldemort's lethal spells and also prevents voldemort from touching harry without suffering terribly. dumbledore also says that the sorcerer's stone has been destroyed to prevent future attempts by voldemort to steal it. finally, at the end-of-year feast, the house points totals are given: gryffindor is in last place. however, dumbledore gives a few \"last-minute additions\", granting points to harry, ron, and hermione, so that gryffindor wins the house cup."

        "text": "Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn&#39;t seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson&#39;s vision was to my own.<br/><br/>Now about the omissions and alterations. I&#39;m not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn&#39;t mind Arwen&#39;s inflation and I&#39;m actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).<br/><br/>The acting was flawless. As I&#39;ve read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn&#39;t play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat&#39;s off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who&#39;s intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It&#39;s EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron&#39;s Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.<br/><br/>What&#39;s wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!"

Regardless of whether you&#39;re a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there&#39;s the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can&#39;t think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it&#39;s exciting, it has bags of character, it&#39;s funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It&#39;s also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I&#39;ve seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving."

        "text": "The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I&#39;d never read any of Tolkien&#39;s books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I&#39;ve read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.<br/><br/>I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don&#39;t want to leave. I&#39;ve never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the &quot;good&quot; characters, but also with the &quot;evil&quot; ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can&#39;t imagine the movie without him.<br/><br/>Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan&#39;s Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.<br/><br/>But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won&#39;t be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.<br/><br/>It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.<br/><br/>The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!"

        "text": "Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.<br/><br/>Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.<br/><br/>The scope of Tolkien&#39;s masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien&#39;s imagination.<br/><br/>But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you&#39;ve-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen&#39;s portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood&#39;s Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I&#39;ve seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven&#39;t seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.<br/><br/>Those unfamiliar with Tolkien&#39;s world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn&#39;t need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.<br/><br/>The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.<br/><br/>Jackson&#39;s ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you&#39;ve seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.<br/><br/>For everyone else: don&#39;t you dare miss it."

        "text": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Today is my birthday. Honestly, it is. It has been a beautiful week. Actually, it has been more than beautiful. The first snow has slowly covered our trees, the cool winterair has boldly taken over the days and nights in Norway. Beautiful. Well, actually, it has been more than beautiful. But what is `more than beautiful&#39;? Today it was the point where a touch of evil was added to the beautiful. And with the evil and the beautiful comes. well, you know where I am getting at. A thrilling adventure, ancientic tale-greatness, monstrous experiences and totally - with no doubts whatsoever - the one film to rule them all. And in MY MIND, bind me. to this film, this book, forever. From heart of someone who has not read the book, nor have any interest in Tolkien, but loves cinema more than anything in the world. this is one of my, if not THE, all-time cinematic moments.<br/><br/>Norway is a small country. And for the small country - only one press screening of FOTR. A small bit about me. I love film, and work as a filmjournalist here in Oslo. Therefore I attended this press-screening. My relation to LOTR is quite simple. Have not read the book, but have been covering the developments of the films. And by that, I have grown a huge interest for the project. Enough now. I HAD AN URGE TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE. Because it is beyond anything I could expect, want, crave, imagine, desire, feel, anticipate. This is unimaginable. And when you see it. I found myself crying of nothing but admiration 2 minutes into the prologue (shiveringly spoken by Blanchett). It shows this dark lord, Sauron, and tells a the fascinating story of The One Ring. Now, excuse me for not being OBSESSIVELY AWARE of everything about this movie (or these books) before seeing or writing this. The prologue is nothing but a amazing sequence. Instead of going into each and every picture (frame) of this film (because I could, and there would be a lot to gaze at and analyse in every single one of them), I will say this: THERE IS SO MUCH. I was completely paralysed. I love every detail I could observe, from the complex battlescenes to the single face of mister Frodo Baggins bedazzling every single audience member. It was a fantastic experience. This review, as I can see, will turn into a not-cronologic piece, but forgive me - my thoughts are a bit hard to recollect. My mind is occupied with images that have burned hard to my iris, performances that I already love and quote. I walked out of the theater 7 hours ago.<br/><br/>I have not read the books, as you can see. Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I&#39;ve just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire. Can I go to these places for vacation? Will I ever have enough money to go to New Zealand? This is so bloody fantastic in this film. It is so fantastic! I run out of words (especially in my English :-). We must go on!<br/><br/>There has been a few hours as I said to dwell on this movie now, buit it&#39;s coming to me. It&#39;s coming to me as a grandiose wave of river-water lifted by the spellbinding of Arwen (Liv Tyler looks so stylish, such a timeless beauty. Eventhough (some stupid, boneheaded) people are going to scream ARMAGEDDON when they see her the first time, they will be silent when this elf is riding away from the black riders - bravely coming the halfling to rescue.) to eliminate ringwraiths(?). IT IS SO VERY, VERY GOOD. (Oh, I love this film. I have to see it again. I need my mother to see this film, I need to pick up a total stranger on the street, offer her a ticket just to see her face when she&#39;s leaving the theatre. I may have given her a lifetime of. well, an experience for a lifetime. Do you hear that Peter Jackson? You may very well, with this masterpiece (I have been dying to call it that), been responsible for thousands of people suffering through this year.) I NEED TO SEE TWO TOWERS NOW!!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!?? READ THE BOOK? I have to know whats happens. That thing happening to Gandalf. I can&#39;t believe it. He must return. Tell me he returns. Ian McKellen is superior. He is great. He acts like if. well, I couldn&#39;t see him act. There is Gandalf in him. For sure. Well, anyway, I am off track.<br/><br/>FOTR is very big. A big tale. But very small. I mean, big it is, but small is he - Frodo. Oh my gracious lord of modern cinema, the very man who gave Mr. And Mrs. The liberty to create the god given actor named Elijah. Nothing crazy about these sentences, but it is a holy great performance. He is feeling. He is a feeling. My back was cold throughout the entire movie. Feeling Frodo, being Frodo, hurting Frodo, bearing with Frodo. A class-act, truly enchanting, spectacular, it-is-no-good-words-to-compliment-enough Frodo. I am, as you just read, trying to verbalize my experience of Frodo Baggins. But this turns away from reviewing. You want to read about the content of the film. What I saw. Because most of you probably know the whole story, and all the characters. Well, let&#39;s go to what there is to see.<br/><br/>\nI saw the Shrine. It is a very richly realistic built, sunny, green place. I loved it. But no surprises. The home of Bilbo, cornfields. and then the city of Bir? Bie? Forgot the name. All the way, amazing scenery. The fact that there is a big difference in height among the characters, but not among the actors, well that is, how do I put it, flawless. Don&#39;t know how they could pull it off, but I am impressed. As I said before, this is so throughoutly worked on and polished - every picture and frame has something more than what you see, and every character blows my mind. What can I say? I&#39;m never this singlemindledly positive about a film, but this may very well be THAT ONE where everything seems to strike my mind and in, again, the cinematic darkness bind me. Every generation has a movie. Every saga has a. hehe, enough filmrelated quotings. Don&#39;t have to say much about this, but so that you know it: Howard Shore&#39;s score is in my cd-player, and this music is. next to my heart.<br/><br/>Bilbo. Just what did I actually know about this Bilbo. Oh, yes he was that hobbit-guy that picked up the Ring from the creature Gollum. I have read the forewords of LOTR. But oh my god. Complexity lies hidden, it seems, in each and every character. Bilbo freaked my out. Scared me more than Gollum (`my precious&#39; shivers still in my bones). What exactly did that ring do to him? One scene has given me the most disturbance (and if someone does not want to know, please do not read further). When Frodo reaches Lothlorien, and re-meets with Bilbo, there is screen magic. As they talk (and he looks so much older already), he gives Frodo the sword. He tells about it&#39;s magic, how it glows blue when orcs are near. Ian Holm is absolutely heartbreaking as Bilbo. Then comes a moment. It hit my spine. He wants to give Frodo the armor (what was it called again?), and Frodo begins to remove his shirt. Then Bilbo sees the ring. Oh s**t, he sees the ring. Ian Holm is magic. &quot;Oh, can I hold it... just for one last time...&quot; &quot;No, Bilbo, stay away&quot;. &quot;IT&#39;s MINE! MY RING! MY PRECIOUS!&quot; It is at that point. Bilbo freaks out. Make-up is brilliant, and the scare of that moment, that scene... still won&#39;t leave my body. Not even my damn mind. And the same thing happens with Galadriel. Don&#39;t want to spoil anything but the scene with Galadriel and Frodo by the mirror (she pours water in it, and he sees &quot;what is to come&quot;). THIS IS MAGIC!!!! Aaahhh. Again, and I can&#39;t say this enough, I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN. Believe me, it is THAT GOOD. The film hadn&#39;t played for long, but I began to realise. what&#39;s next for Frodo. He is now the ringebearer. Look at Bilbo. Again it strikes me.. I HAVE TO SEE THE NEXT TO FILMS NOW!!! Because there is no end to this film. Actually I couldn&#39;t believe it ended when it did. I needed more. It felt like one hour tops, but I had been nailed to my seat for 3 hours already. Amazing experience. The film have no ending, and there&#39;s evil there, that does not sleep . Now you get the picture; I love this film! I love LORD OF THE RINGS. This is just remarkable. My imagination. oh, I have no imagination. I did not, could not, imagine this. Imagine there&#39;s no people. Imagine if this film had not been made. I may have lived my life without knowing this story. All of you who read the book and hate them for turning this into a movie. Think of all of us who now have been rescued from living our lives without it. Thank you, everyone behind this film, for making it.<br/><br/>Koola from Norway<br/><br/>A small PS: The fellowship. It was beautifully casted. Flawless. Gimli - unforgettable John Rhys-Davies. The hobbits - just charming to their hairy feet, and they touched me deep. Aragorn and Boromir - more than anything, believable. They are men, they have no effects or make-up to characterize them. But they are massive. They suffer, and it hurts. Viggo Mortensen is my hero. (And did you all know he is related to Denmark, my neighbourcountry?). Legolas though.. He was my favourite. Feels weird to write the least about the character I loved the most, but it&#39;s just. not much to say. Could not stand seeing Legolas leave the screen, he had an remarkable impact on me with his. elvish magic. Oh, and one last thing. This is a chaos. My mind is a chaos. FOTR is so much, much more. I haven&#39;t said a thing about Galladriel, and a lot more. But there has to be a limit. If I were you now, I would look forward to every second of this film, so then. it does not matter.<br/><br/>\nI will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life. It is that good."

For the record, I&#39;m 25 years old, and I&#39;ve read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo&#39;s table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.<br/><br/> Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of &#39;Fellowship of the Ring&#39; lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I&#39;ve read a reviewer saying he&#39;d make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with &#39;Alvin and the Chimpmunks&#39; kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.<br/><br/>Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson&#39;s vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson&#39;s, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that&#39;s the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.<br/><br/>As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.<br/><br/>The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried &quot;ranger&quot;. Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he&#39;s willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the &#39;best friend&#39; everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can&#39;t wait for his return.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I can&#39;t wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I&#39;ll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure."

Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson&#39;s roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It&#39;s a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy&#39;s place in my heart is secure."

      "plot_summary": "Prologue: In Middle-earth, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring to dominate bearers of the Rings of Power. A Last Alliance of Elves and Men defeats Sauron; Isildur cuts the Ring from Sauron's hand but keeps it instead of destroying it. Isildur is later killed and the Ring is lost in a river. Centuries later Gollum possesses the Ring for centuries before Bilbo Baggins finds it in the Goblin tunnels and takes it to the Shire. Sixty years later Bilbo leaves the Ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins at his 111th birthday. Gandalf investigates, learns the artifact is Sauron's One Ring, and discovers that Orcs tortured Gollum who revealed \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf warns Frodo to flee the Shire. Frodo departs with Samwise Gamgee to Bree; Merry Brandybuck and Peregrin Took join them. Gandalf rides to Isengard to question Saruman; Saruman has betrayed the White Council, allied with Sauron, and imprisons Gandalf atop Orthanc. In Bree they meet Aragorn (Strider), who escorts them toward Rivendell. On Weathertop the Nazgûl attack; Frodo is stabbed with a Morgul blade and begins to fade. Aragorn leads them toward Rivendell while Frodo is pursued by the Ringwraiths. The elf Arwen intercepts and brings Frodo into Rivendell, where Elrond heals him. At the Council of Elrond representatives of Elves, Dwarves, and Men debate the Ring's fate; only Mount Doom's fires will destroy it. Frodo volunteers to carry the Ring to Mordor. A Fellowship is formed to help him: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir. They attempt to cross the Redhorn Pass at Caradhras, but are turned back by snow and Saruman's malice. The Fellowship enters the Mines of Moria to cross under the mountain. Pippin alerts orcs, and while fleeing they encounter Durin's Bane, a Balrog, on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Gandalf confronts the Balrog, breaks the bridge, and falls with the demon into the abyss. The Fellowship flees to Lothlórien, where Galadriel and Celeborn shelter them; Galadriel gives Frodo gifts, warns him that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring, and shows him a dark vision. They travel down the Anduin by boats; at Parth Galen Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo. Frodo puts the Ring on and flees; realizing the Fellowship is compromised, Frodo decides to continue alone. Merry and Pippin distract an attacking force of Uruk-hai to let Frodo escape; Boromir is mortally wounded defending them and confesses his failure to Aragorn before dying. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride off to rescue the captured Merry and Pippin; Frodo, accompanied only by Sam after Frodo allows him to come, departs for Mordor alone by crossing Emyn Muil and heading toward the black land. The film ends with the Fellowship broken: Frodo and Sam marching toward Mordor, Aragorn leading a pursuit, and Merry and Pippin taken by enemies.",

      "galadriel (cate blanchett) (the elven co-ruler of lothlorien alongside her husband celeborn (marton csokas)), shows the dark lord sauron forging the one ring which he can use to conquer the lands of middle-earth through his enslavement of the bearers of the rings of power: powerful magical rings given to individuals from the races of elves, dwarves and men.\na last alliance of elves and men is formed to counter sauron and his forces at the foot of mount doom, but sauron himself appears to kill elendil (peter mckenzie), the high king of arnor and gondor, and gil-galad (mark ferguson), high king of the noldor. just afterward, elendil's son isildur (harry sinclair) grabs his father's broken sword narsil, and slashes at sauron's hand. the stroke cuts off sauron's fingers, separating him from the ring and vanquishing his army. however, because sauron's life is bound in the ring, he is not completely defeated until the ring itself is destroyed. isildur takes the ring and succumbs to its temptation, refusing to destroy it, but he is later ambushed and killed by orcs and the ring is lost in the river into which isildur fell. the ring is found 2500 years later, and eventually it comes to the creature gollum (andy serkis) (a wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the ring after bearing it for 500 years), who takes it underground for five centuries, giving gollum \"unnaturally long life.\"\nthe ring leaves him however, and is found by the hobbit bilbo baggins (ian holm), much to the grief of gollum. bilbo returns to his home in the shire with the ring, and the story jumps forward in time sixty years.\nat his 111th birthday, bilbo leaves the ring to his nephew and adopted heir frodo baggins (elijah wood). the wizard gandalf (ian mckellen) investigates the ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that gollum was captured and brutally tortured by sauron's orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"shire\" and \"baggins.\"\ngandalf returns and warns frodo to leave the shire. frodo departs with his friend, gardener sam (sean astin) to bree, with plans to meet him there after gandalf goes to isengard to meet the head of his order, saruman (christopher lee). saruman reveals that the nazgul, or ringwraiths, have left mordor to capture the ring and kill whoever carries it; having already turned to sauron's cause, he then imprisons gandalf atop orthanc. frodo and sam are soon joined by fellow hobbits merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd). after encountering a ringwraith on the road, they manage to reach bree, and there they meet a man called strider (viggo mortensen), who agrees to lead them to rivendell. they agree only because gandalf isn't there to guide them. after some travelling, they spend the night on the hill of weathertop, where they are attacked by the nazgul at night. strider fights off the ringwraiths, but frodo is grievously wounded with a morgul blade, and they must quickly get him to rivendell for healing. while chased by the nazgul, frodo is taken by the elf arwen (liv tyler) (also strider's beloved) to the elvish haven of rivendell, and healed by her father, elrond (hugo weaving). in rivendell frodo meets gandalf, who explains why he didn't meet them at bree as planned. in the meantime, there are many meetings between various peoples, and elrond calls a council to decide what should be done with the ring. the ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires (that is, lava) of mount doom, where it was forged. mount doom is located in mordor, near sauron's fortress of barad-dur, and will be an incredibly dangerous journey. frodo volunteers to take the ring to mount doom as all the others argue about who should or shouldn't take it. he is accompanied by his hobbit friends and gandalf, as well as strider, who is revealed to be aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of gondor. bilbo, now living in rivendell, gives frodo his sword sting, and a chain-mail shirt made of mithril. also travelling with them are the elf legolas (orlando bloom), the dwarf gimli (john rhys-davies) and boromir (sean bean), the son of the steward of gondor. together they comprise the fellowship of the ring. the fellowship set out and try to pass the mountain caradhras, but they are stopped by saruman's wizardry. they are forced to travel under the mountain through the mines of moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end.\nafter journeying partway through the mines, pippin accidentally gives away their presence to a band of orcs. the fellowship then encounter a balrog (durin's bane is a balrog residing within the mines), an ancient demon of fire and shadow, at the bridge of khazad-dum. while the others escape, gandalf fends off the balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the balrog drags gandalf down into the darkness with him. the group flees to the elvish realm of lothlorien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, galadriel and her husband celeborn. galadriel privately informs frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the fellowship will try to take the ring. she also shows him a vision of the future in which sauron succeeds in enslaving middle-earth, including the shire.\nmeanwhile, saruman creates an army of uruk-hai in isengard to find and kill the fellowship.\nafter resting, they decide to travel on the river anduin towards parth galen. before they leave, galadriel gives frodo the phial of galadriel. after landing at parth galen, boromir tries to take the ring from frodo, who manages to escape by putting the ring on his finger and vanishing. knowing that the ring's temptation will be too strong for the fellowship, frodo decides to leave them and go to mordor alone. meanwhile, the rest of the fellowship are attacked by uruk-hai. merry and pippin, realizing that frodo is leaving, distract the orcs, allowing frodo to escape. boromir rushes to the aid of the two hobbits but is mortally wounded by the orc commander lurtz, and merry and pippin are captured.\naragorn, legolas, and gimli find boromir, who regrets attempting to steal the ring and dies. fearing the ring will corrupt his friends, frodo decides to travel to mordor alone, but allows sam to come along, recalling his promise to gandalf to look after him. as aragorn, legolas, and gimli set out to rescue merry and pippin, frodo and sam make their way down the pass of emyn muil, journeying on to mordor."

        "text": "Ridley Scott&#39;s Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I&#39;m firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.<br/><br/>In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann&#39;s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator&#39;s success is there for all to see.<br/><br/>What we do in life echoes in eternity.<br/><br/>So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly &quot;Grade A&quot; stuff, and there&#39;s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe&#39;s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life&#39;s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.<br/><br/>Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen&#39;s turn here against that of Diane Kruger&#39;s in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that&#39;s inspiring.<br/><br/>I didn&#39;t know man could build such things.<br/><br/>Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men&#39;s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10"

There&#39;s so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard &amp; Hans Zimmer&#39;s iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott&#39;s superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché&#39;s that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film&#39;s status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips."

The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.<br/><br/>The best of Russell Crow are far as I&#39;m concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he&#39;s awesome.<br/><br/>I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.<br/><br/>One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10."

Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer&#39;s score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film.

People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist&#39;s dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you&#39;re looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction."

      "plot_summary": "In 180 A.D., General Maximus Decimus Meridius leads Roman legions to victory against Germanic tribes and is hailed by soldiers and the aging Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius intends to name Maximus his successor and restore power to the Senate, but his jealous son Commodus murders Aurelius after overhearing the plan. Commodus orders Maximus's execution; Maximus escapes the executioners only to return home and find his villa burned and his wife and son crucified. Captured by slave traders, Maximus is sold in Zucchabar to Proximo, a retired gladiator-owner. Grief-stricken and initially refusing to fight, Maximus kills in the arena when attacked and proves a formidable gladiator, gaining popularity. He befriends fellow gladiators Juba (a Numidian) and Hagen (a Germanic slave).\n\nCommodus reopens the games in Rome to consolidate power. Proximo's troupe is hired to fight in the Colosseum; Maximus leads them to victory in a staged battle recreation and is recognized by the crowd. Commodus is enraged but cannot kill Maximus because of public support. Commodus then pits Maximus against Tigris of Gaul; Maximus defeats Tigris and spares him, earning the epithet \"Maximus the Merciful\" and increasing his popularity while Commodus's prestige declines. Maximus's former servant Cicero informs him that Maximus's loyal legions are encamped at Portus/Ostia. Lucilla, Commodus's sister, and Senator Gracchus conspire with Maximus to use the army to overthrow Commodus and restore the Republic.\n\nCommodus learns of the conspiracy after torturing Lucilla's son and betrays her. The Praetorian Guard storms Proximo's ludus; Proximo and Hagen are killed, other gladiators are captured, and Maximus narrowly escapes but is pursued. Maximus reaches the city walls and attempts to rally support but is ambushed; Lucilla's plot collapses. Commodus, seeking a public resolution, challenges Maximus to single combat in the Colosseum. Before the duel, Commodus stabs Maximus with a hidden dagger, puncturing his lung and leaving the wound concealed beneath armor. In the public duel Commodus fights dishonorably; Maximus overpowers him, disarms him, and then kills Commodus with the same hidden stiletto after Commodus tries to renew the attack. Mortally wounded from Commodus's earlier stab, Maximus walks to the emperor's box and, with his remaining breath, orders the release of Proximo's surviving gladiators and instructs Senator Gracchus to restore power to the Senate. Maximus dies in the arena; Lucilla is reassured that her son is safe. Juba buries Maximus's small statues of his wife and son in the Colosseum, and Proximo's freed gladiators carry Maximus's body away as Rome moves toward the promised political change.",

      "shouting \"roma invicta!\" as his forces attack, general maximus decimus meridius (russell crowe) leads the roman army to victory against germanic barbarians in the year 180 a.d., ending a prolonged war and earning the esteem of elderly emperor marcus aurelius. although the dying aurelius has a son, commodus (joaquin phoenix), he decides to appoint temporary leadership to the morally-upstanding maximus, with a desire to eventually return power to the roman senate. aurelius informs maximus and offers him time to consider before informing commodus, who, in a bout of jealousy, murders his father. declaring himself the emperor, commodus asks maximus for his loyalty, which maximus, realizing commodus' involvement in the emperor's death, refuses. commodus orders maximus' execution and dispatches praetorian guards to murder maximus' wife and son. maximus narrowly escapes his execution and races home only to discover his family's charred and crucified bodies in the smoldering ruins of his villa. after burying his wife and son, a grieving maximus succumbs to exhaustion and collapses on their graves. slave traders find maximus and take him to zucchabar, a rugged province in north africa, where he is purchased by proximo, the head of a local gladiator school. distraught and nihilistic over the death of his family and betrayal by his empire, maximus initially refuses to fight, but as he defends himself in the arena his formidable combat skills lead to a rise in popularity with the audience. as he trains and fights further, maximus befriends hagen, a germanic barbarian, and juba, a numidian hunter, the latter becoming a close friend and confidant to the grieving maximus, the two speaking frequently of the afterlife and maximus' eventual reunification with his family. in rome, commodus reopens the gladiatorial games to commemorate his father's death, and proximo's company of gladiators are hired to participate. in a recreation of the battle of zama (incorrectly named the battle of carthage) at the colosseum, maximus leads proximo's gladiators to decisive victory against a more powerful force, much to the amazement of the crowd. commodus descends into the arena to meet the victors and is stunned to discover maximus as the leader of proximo's gladiators. the emperor, unable to kill maximus because of the crowd's roaring approval for him, sulks out of the arena. as the games continue, commodus pits maximus against tigris of gaul, rome's only undefeated gladiator, in an arena surrounded by chained tigers with handlers instructed to target maximus. following an intense battle, maximus narrowly defeats tigris and awaits commodus' decision to kill or spare tigris. as commodus votes for death, maximus spares tigris, deliberately insulting the emperor and garnering the audience's approval. his bitter enemy now known as \"maximus the merciful,\" commodus becomes more frustrated at his inability to kill maximus or stop his ascending popularity while commodus' own popularity shrinks. following the fight, maximus meets his former servant cicero, who reveals that maximus's army remains loyal to him. they are camped at the port ostia. maximus forms a plot with lucilla, commodus' sister, and senator gracchus to reunite maximus with his army and overthrow commodus. commodus however, suspecting his sister's betrayal, threatens her young son and forces her to reveal the plot. praetorian guards immediately storm proximo's gladiator barracks, battling the gladiators while maximus escapes. hagen and proximo are killed in the siege while juba and the survivors are imprisoned. maximus escapes to the city walls only to witness cicero's death and be ambushed by a legion of praetorian guards. concluding that legends born in the colosseum must die there, commodus personally challenges maximus to a duel in front of a roaring audience. acknowledging that maximus' skill exceeds his own, commodus deliberately stabs maximus with a stiletto, puncturing his lung, and has the wound concealed beneath the gladiator's armor. in the arena, the two exchange blows before maximus rips the sword from commodus's hands. commodus requests a sword from his guards, but they betray him and refuse to lend him their weapons. maximus drops his own sword, but commodus pulls a hidden stiletto and renews his attack. maximus then beats commodus into submission and kills him with his own stiletto. as commodus collapses in the now-silent colosseum, a dying maximus begins seeing his wife and son in the afterlife. he reaches for them but is pulled back to reality by the praetorian prefect quintus, who asks for instructions. maximus orders the release of proximo's gladiators and senator gracchus, whom he reinstates and instructs to return rome to a senate-based government. maximus collapses, and lucilla rushes to his aid. after being reassured that her son is safe and commodus is dead, maximus dies and wanders into the afterlife to his family in the distance. senator gracchus and proximo's gladiators carry his body out of the colosseum. that night, a newly freed juba buries maximus' two small statues of his wife and son in the colosseum, and says that he too will eventually join them, but not yet."

Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.<br/><br/>For someone like me, who&#39;ve rarely slept without dream, it&#39;s so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it&#39;s been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it&#39;s been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan&#39;s remarkable works:\n<ul><li>Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I&#39;ve ever seen. But overall, it doesn&#39;t reach the same level of Inception.</li><li>The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven&#39;t been able to find the very particular &quot;Nolan&#39;s spirit&quot; in it.</li><li>The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.</li><li>Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan&#39;s nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience&#39;s mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.</li><li>Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nSPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven&#39;t watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!<br/><br/>It is set in the world where there&#39;s technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - &quot;extractors&quot; who use this technology to infiltrate the target&#39;s subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person&#39;s subconscious, which is also called &quot;inception&quot;. In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels &quot;dream within a dream&quot;, and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito&#39;s biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who&#39;s dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father&#39;s business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer&#39;s mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb&#39;s past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.<br/><br/>The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb&#39;s case, it&#39;s the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We&#39;re now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn&#39;t even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn&#39;t care any more, what&#39;s important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.<br/><br/>\nSome short lines about the cast:\n<ul><li>Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.</li><li>Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).</li><li>There was something missing in Ken Watanabe&#39;s performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...</li><li>Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn&#39;t have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.</li><li>Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.</li><li>Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.</li><li>Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.</li></ul>"

There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. <br/><br/>2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. <br/><br/>3. its edgy drive - although you know what&#39;s coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.<br/><br/>4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it&#39;s hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. <br/><br/>5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. <br/><br/>6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.<br/><br/>Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. <br/><br/>2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. <br/><br/>3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I&#39;m afraid, Inception overused this trick. <br/><br/>In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. <br/><br/>I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. <br/><br/>Cheers!"

Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You&#39;re waiting for that line for whole content.

        "text": "The central idea of &quot;Inception&quot; is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people&#39;s dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of &quot;Memento&quot; fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, &quot;Inception&quot; is a bloated failure.<br/><br/>The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What&#39;s going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that&#39;s the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.<br/><br/>The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn&#39;t nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it&#39;s time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.<br/><br/>Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that&#39;s never gonna happen, but it&#39;s *my* dream.)"

        "text": "What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood&#39;s most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?<br/><br/>Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he&#39;s increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!<br/><br/>But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: &#39;Inception&#39;<br/><br/>Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb&#39;s &#39;brainiac&#39; specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a &quot;forger&quot; who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.<br/><br/>There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don&#39;t just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.<br/><br/>Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the &#39;Best Director&#39; category. If &quot;Inception&quot; is a metaphysical puzzle, it&#39;s also a metaphorical one: It&#39;s hard not to draw connections between Cobb&#39;s dream-weaving and Nolan&#39;s film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.<br/><br/>To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Thanks &amp; Regards."

        "text": "Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people&#39;s minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.<br/><br/>Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as &quot;a film that rewards intellect&quot;, and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan&#39;s previous film, The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It&#39;s a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.<br/><br/>Inception is magnificent."

      "plot_summary": "Dominick \"Dom\" Cobb, an extractor who uses military dream-sharing technology to steal secrets from people's subconscious, and his partner Arthur try to extract from Japanese businessman Saito aboard a business meeting in Tokyo; the extraction is sabotaged by appearances of Cobb's deceased wife, Mal. Saito reveals he was testing them and offers Cobb a job: perform inception—plant an idea in Robert Michael Fischer Jr.'s mind so Fischer will dissolve his father's energy conglomerate. In return Saito will use his influence to clear Cobb's murder charges so Cobb can return to the United States and see his children. Cobb assembles a team in Los Angeles: Arthur (planner), Eames (forger/conman), Yusuf (chemist) who creates a heavy sedative for layered dreaming, and Ariadne (architecture student) to design the dream landscapes; Saito insists on joining to witness success.\n\nThe team isolates Fischer on a flight from Sydney to Los Angeles after his father's death, sedates him and themselves, and begin a three-level dream-within-dream inception. Level 1 (Yusuf's rainy downtown) the team abducts Fischer; projections from Fischer's trained subconscious attack and wound Saito. Eames seduces Fischer's perception by impersonating his godfather Peter Browning to plant doubt about his father's intentions. Level 2 (Arthur's hotel) the team manipulates Fischer into believing the kidnapping was staged to push him to make his own choices. Level 3 (Eames's snowy mountain fortress) they prepare the final suggestion that Fischer should break up his father's company and be his \"own man.\" Because the team uses layered dreams, each deeper level requires synchronized \"kicks\"—forces to wake sleepers—timed by the team members remaining behind in higher levels.\n\nYusuf, under attack in level 1, tries to kick early by driving the van off a bridge; the timing error removes gravity in the hotel level, causing an avalanche in the mountain level and derailing several kicks. Saito's wound worsens. Cobb's subconscious projection of Mal manifests repeatedly and increasingly sabotages the mission: she kills Fischer in the mountain fortress, sending both Fischer and Saito into limbo (profound, unconstructed subconscious space) because of the heavy sedation—death in the dream can consign sleepers to limbo. Cobb and Ariadne descend into limbo to retrieve Fischer and Saito while Eames stays to arrange the fortress kick with explosives and Arthur improvises a synchronized elevator kick.\n\nIn limbo Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and the real Mal were trapped in limbo decades earlier and spent what felt like decades building an elaborate shared world; when they escaped to waking life, Mal believed they were still dreaming and committed suicide to force them awake, framing Cobb and creating his murder charges. Cobb had become a fugitive, separated from his children. In limbo Cobb chooses to find and revive Saito; Ariadne locates an unconstructed Fischer and pushes him off a balcony to force a revival in the mountain fortress where he finds the planted idea and accepts it. The team executes the remaining kicks: Eames detonates explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts the elevator in level 2, Yusuf's van hits the water in level 1. Cobb finds an aged Saito in limbo; they remind each other of their bargain, shoot themselves to wake, and all awaken on the airplane.\n\nBack in reality at Los Angeles airport, Saito uses his influence to clear Cobb's record; Cobb passes through U.S. immigration and reunites with his father-in-law Stephen Miles, then sees his children. Cobb tests reality with his totem, a spinning top that indicates dreaming if it spins indefinitely, but he sets it spinning on a table and walks away to embrace his children without watching to see if it falls, leaving the film's final state—whether Cobb is awake or still dreaming—ambiguous.",

      "dominick \"dom\" cobb (leonardo dicaprio) and business partner arthur (joseph gordon-levitt) are \"extractors\", people who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while experiencing shared dreaming. their latest target is japanese businessman saito (ken watanabe). the extraction from saito fails when sabotaged by a memory of cobb's deceased wife mal (marion cotillard). after cobb's and arthur's associate sells them out, saito reveals that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of \"inception\": planting an idea in a person's subconscious. in order to break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor maurice fischer (pete postlethwaite), saito wants cobb to plant the idea of dissolving the company into the mind of fischer's heir, son robert fischer (cillian murphy). should cobb succeed, saito tells cobb he will use his influence to clear cobb of a murder charge, which will allow cobb to return home and to his children. cobb accepts saito's offer. cobb sets about assembling his team: eames (tom hardy), a conman and identity forger; yusuf (dileep rao), a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable \"dream within a dream\" strategy; ariadne (elliot page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and arthur. saito insists on accompanying the team to verify the team's success. when the elder fischer dies in sydney, robert fischer accompanies the body on a flight back to los angeles, which the team uses as an opportunity to isolate fischer. cobb sedates him, bringing him into a shared dream with the extractors. using a \"dream within a dream\" strategy, at each level in the layered dreaming, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members who have entered another dream layer deeper. due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during the mission will result in entering limbo, an expanse of infinite raw subconscious. limbo is a space not dreamed by any one individual but is shared space where one mind can make drastic alterations of any kind. in the first level, yusuf's rainy downtown dream, the team abducts fischer; however, fischer's trained subconscious projections attack, wounding saito severely. eames temporarily takes the appearance of fischer's godfather, peter browning (tom berenger), to suggest fischer reconsider his father's will. yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by arthur. here, the extractors recruit fischer, convincing him that his kidnapping was orchestrated by browning and that they are fischer's subconscious dependency. in the third level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by eames, fischer is told they are in browning's subconscious, but they are really going deeper into fischer's. yusuf, under assault in the first level, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, removing the gravity of arthur's dream world and causing an avalanche in eames' dream, a kick which all missed. arthur improvises a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in eames' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks. saito succumbs to his wounds, and cobb's projection of mal sabotages the entire plan by killing fischer, sending them both into limbo. cobb and ariadne enter limbo to find fischer and saito, while eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. cobb reveals to ariadne that he spent \"50 years\" with mal in limbo constructing a world from their shared memories while seemingly growing old together. returning to the waking world, cobb and mal found less than three hours had passed. convinced she was still dreaming, mal committed suicide and tried to persuade cobb to do so too, by incriminating him in her death. facing a murder charge cobb fled the u.s., leaving his children behind, ostensibly in the shared care of his mother- and father-in-law, prof. stephen miles (michael caine). through his confession, cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in limbo to search for saito. ariadne pushes fischer off a balcony, resuscitating him at the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his \"own man\", and that splitting up the conglomerate might not be a radical notion. all team members other than cobb and saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: ariadne jumps off a balcony in limbo, eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in yusuf's dream hits the water. cobb eventually finds an aged saito in limbo and the two remember their arrangement, presumably shooting themselves and waking to outer-world reality back on the airplane, where the entire team and robert fischer have awakened. upon arriving in los angeles, cobb successfully passes through u.s. customs to his waiting father-in-law, who reunites him with his children. cobb attempts to determine if he is dreaming or awake by spinning a top but ignores its outcome to instead happily greet his family."

The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it&#39;s understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.<br/><br/>A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."

        "text": "I have an interesting history and relationship with this film. Never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed. I had absolutely no idea what I was in for and what I was about to experience.<br/><br/>This movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it&#39;s first act. The first 40 minutes of The Matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.<br/><br/>The surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up &quot;How do you define &#39;real&#39;&quot; Where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that &#39;reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain&#39; is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of The Matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the Internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of VR at the moment (I mean have you seen Half-Life Alyx)<br/><br/>And of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. Truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.<br/><br/>And that&#39;s about as far as I survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. As a kid&#39;s first viewing, this movie successfully found it&#39;s way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. You would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. The Matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.<br/><br/>The first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it&#39;s head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of Neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.<br/><br/>Once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. You can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. The Matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it&#39;s writing and direction. The casting was very well thought out with Keanu Reeves killing it as Neo, aswell as Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss as great supporting roles, with Hugo Weaving as an extremley strong Sci-Fi villan as the cold, sociopathic AI Villan Agent Smith.<br/><br/>With Neo as the embodiment of humanity against Smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. A classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that&#39;s just the power of this film."

        "text": "The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.<br/><br/>Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody &#39;ooh&#39;-ed or &#39;aah&#39;-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.<br/><br/>But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would&#39;ve been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you&#39;re bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.<br/><br/>People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there&#39;s a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that&#39;s closer to reality than you think.<br/><br/>Either that or it&#39;s my personal choice for best film of all-time."

        "text": "** May contain spoilers **<br/><br/>There aren&#39;t many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by &#39;Rage against the Machine&#39;), I queued up for the next screening of &#39;The Matrix&#39;. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn&#39;t caught every detail of what I&#39;d just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn&#39;t watch it at least twice. It&#39;s simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.<br/><br/>In structure, style and concept, &#39;The Matrix&#39; was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as &#39;Akira&#39; or &#39;Ghost in the Shell&#39; had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from &#39;Blade Runner&#39;, which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn&#39;t been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you&#39;ll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity&#39;s war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant &#39;species&#39; and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as &#39;Blade Runner&#39; or &#39;The Terminator&#39; - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a &quot;liberator&quot; or even a &quot;messiah&quot; make &#39;The Matrix&#39; transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.<br/><br/>&#39;The Matrix&#39; was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can&#39;t distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after &#39;The Matrix&#39; have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

        "text": "Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn&#39;t until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn&#39;t until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won&#39;t say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.<br/><br/>Acting wise the film works excellently. I won&#39;t say that there aren&#39;t any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn&#39;t have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo&#39;s mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can&#39;t say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don&#39;t wan&#39;t to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.<br/><br/>Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you&#39;ll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.<br/><br/>The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn&#39;t see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning &quot;man&quot; and combine this with the second part of his last name &quot;son&quot; and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination &quot;son of man&quot; which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): &quot;You&#39;re my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ.&quot; It doesn&#39;t get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard&#39;s essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.<br/><br/>To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won&#39;t regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don&#39;t expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.<br/><br/>10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."

Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a Bay-area computer programmer who secretly hacks under the alias \"Neo,\" notices cryptic references to \"the Matrix\" on his computer. After receiving messages — \"wake up, Neo\" and \"follow the white rabbit\" — Neo meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) at a nightclub; Trinity later helps him escape a police/agent raid and introduces him to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus contacts Neo by phone during a Metacortex office raid by three men in black suits — Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), Agent Brown and Agent Jones — who attempt to arrest Neo. Morpheus remotely guides Neo's escape but Neo is captured, interrogated and implanted with a tracking probe by the agents. Morpheus's team rescues Neo, removes the probe, and offers him a choice: take the blue pill to forget or the red pill to learn the truth. Neo swallows the red pill and wakes up physically years later, naked and hairless in a pod in a machine farm. He is rescued by the hovercraft Nebuchadnezzar and its crew — Morpheus, Trinity, Tank, Dozer, Apoc, Switch and Mouse — and brought to their Zion-born operators.\n\nAboard the Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus explains the truth: the world Neo knew is the Matrix, a neural-interactive simulated reality created by intelligent machines that harvest human bioelectricity; the real world is a devastated, machine-dominated wasteland and the remaining free humans live underground in the city Zion. Morpheus believes Neo is \"the One,\" a prophesied human able to break the Matrix. Tank trains Neo in combat via jacked-in construct programs and Neo learns martial arts and to bend the simulation's rules. Morpheus tests Neo in a rooftop jump program; Neo fails to make a leap. The ship detects machine sentinels and hides in sewers to avoid them. Meanwhile, crew member Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) secretly meets Agent Smith and agrees to betray Morpheus in exchange for being reinserted into the Matrix with erased memories.\n\nMorpheus takes Neo and the crew to see the Oracle (Gloria Foster) inside the Matrix; the Oracle cryptically suggests Neo may not be the One and warns that he will soon face a choice involving Morpheus's life. On the way out, the team is ambushed by police and agents — Mouse is killed, others scatter — and Morpheus allows himself to be captured to enable the others' escape because Cypher has sabotaged their extraction. Back on the Nebuchadnezzar, Cypher unplugs and murders crew members as he betrays them; Tank kills Cypher and extracts Neo, Trinity and a few survivors. The agents interrogate Morpheus in the Matrix, trying to extract Zion's mainframe access codes; Agent Smith explains how previous Matrix iterations failed because humans rejected a perfect world.\n\nBelieving Morpheus's capture must be rescued, Neo chooses to return into the Matrix despite the Oracle's ambiguous prophecy. Trinity and Neo re-enter, use a telephone exit plan and infiltrate the building where Morpheus is held. They fight through SWAT and agents; Trinity climbs the elevator shaft to free Morpheus. Neo confronts Agent Smith in the hallway, where Neo increasingly manipulates the Matrix to dodge bullets and fight. The Nebuchadnezzar, meanwhile, is attacked in the real world by swarming sentinels; Tank fires an EMP to disable them but only after the ship is critical. During the rescue, Neo is shot multiple times by Agent Smith and dies in the real world. Trinity, kneeling beside Neo, tells him the Oracle said she would fall in love with the One, kisses him, and in the Matrix her kiss restores him. Neo's understanding and power surge: he now perceives and overrides the Matrix's rules, reverses his death, destroys Agent Smith by destabilizing him across connected bodies, and returns to the real world. Tank fires the EMP, disabling the sentinels and saving the ship.\n\nThe film ends with Neo back inside the Matrix making a phone call on a public line: he promises to show the enslaved humans the truth and that he will fight the system; he then takes off, flying upward and away, demonstrating his new ability as \"the One.\"",

      "in 1999, in an unnamed city, computer programmer thomas anderson (keanu reeves) is secretly a hacker known as \"neo\". he is restless, eager and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to the \"matrix\" appearing on his computer.\na woman named trinity is observing neo, and she does so knowing that morpheus believes that neo is \"the one\". during one of her forays, trinity is tracked down by the local police to her hotel room. outside the hotel a car drives up and three agents appear in neatly pressed black suits. they are agent smith (hugo weaving), agent brown (paul goddard), and agent jones (robert taylor). trinity calls morpheus and says that her line was tracked and morpheus orders her to find another exit.\ntrinity easily defeats the six policemen sent to apprehend her, using fighting and evasion techniques that seem to defy gravity. a fierce rooftop chase ensues with trinity and an agent leaping impossibly from one building to the next, astonishing the policemen left behind. trinity makes a daring leap across an alley and through a small window. trinity makes it to a public phone booth on the street level. the phone begins to ring. as she approaches it a garbage truck, driven by agent smith, careens towards the phone booth. trinity makes a desperate dash to the phone, picking it up just moments before the truck smashes the booth into a brick wall. the three agents find no body in the wreckage. \"she got out,\" one says. the other says, \"the informant is real.\" \"we have the name of their next target,\" says the other, \"his name is neo.\" notices about a manhunt for a man named morpheus scroll across neo's screen as he sleeps. suddenly neo's screen goes blank, and a series of text messages appear: \"wake up, neo.\" \"the matrix has you.\" \"follow the white rabbit.\" a group of ravers comes to neo and neo gives them a contraband disc he has secreted in a copy of \"simulacra and simulation.\" the lead raver asks him to join them and neo demurs until he sees the tattoo of a small white rabbit on the shoulder of a seductive girl in the group. trinity approaches neo at the rave bar. neo recognizes her name as she was a famous hacker and had cracked the irs database.\na female hacker named trinity (carrie-anne moss) confirms that a man named morpheus (laurence fishburne) can help him. neo works at metacortex, a leading software company housed in an ominous high rise. at his desk, neo finds a package with a phone, which rings. on the other end is morpheus, who informs neo that they've both run out of time and that \"they\" are coming for him. morpheus tells him to slowly look up, toward the elevator. agents smith, jones, and brown are there, obviously looking for him, as a woman points towards neo's cube. three sinister agents, led by agent smith (hugo weaving), come to arrest neo and attempt to prevent him from collaborating with morpheus. morpheus guides neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements. morpheus tries to guide neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof neo rejects morpheus' advice, allowing himself to be taken by the agents. the agents interrogate neo about morpheus, but he refuses to cooperate. agent smith asks him to help them capture morpheus, considered a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty. neo gives them the finger and asks for his phone call. in response, neo's mouth suddenly seals shut, and the agents implant a robotic device in his abdomen. neo awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare. neo awakens with a start in his own bed. morpheus is on the other line. morpheus tells neo he is the one and to meet him at the adams st. bridge. there he is picked up by trinity and two others in a car. a woman in the front seat, switch (belinda mcclory) uses a device to remove the probe that neo believed had been part of a nightmare. trinity drops the bug out into the road where it slowly goes dark in the rain.\ntrinity and her allies bring neo to morpheus, their leader. undeterred, neo meets with morpheus. morpheus offers neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life. neo agrees to follow him by swallowing an offered red pill. as the rest of morpheus's crew straps him into a chair, neo is told that pill he took is part of a trace program, to \"disrupt his input/output carrier signal\" so that they can pinpoint him.\nopting for the red pill, neo's reality distorts, and he awakens submerged in a liquid-filled, mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body. he is hairless and naked, with thick black tubes snaking down his throat, plugged into the back of his skull, his spine, and invading most of the rest of his body. neo is connected along with thousands of other people to an elaborate electrical structure. suddenly a menacing, hovering nurse robot grabs him by the throat. the cable inserted into the base of his skull suddenly detaches. the rest of the tubes pop off his limbs and neo is flushed down a tube into an underground pool of filthy water. just as he's about to drown in the muck a hovercraft appears above him, snags him and hauls him into its cargo bay. he is rescued by morpheus and brought aboard a levitating ship called the nebuchadnezzar. morpheus's crew includes trinity, apoc (julian arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair, switch, cypher (bald with a goatee), two brawny brothers, tank (marcus chong) and dozer (anthony ray parker), and a young, thin man named mouse (matt doran). morpheus gets to the point. \"you wanted to know about the matrix,\" he says, ushering him to a chair. neo sits down in it and trinity straps him in. a long probe is inserted into the socket at the back of neo's skull. neo wakes in a world of all white. he is in the construct, a \"loading platform\" that morpheus and his team use to prepare newly freed humans to deal with the matrix world. gone are the sockets in neo's arms and neck and his hair is grown in. morpheus tells him that what he is experiencing of himself is the \"residual self image, the mental projection of your digital self\" and bids him to sit while he explains the truth. \"this,\" he says, showing an image of a modern city, \"is the world that you know.\" a thing that really exists \"only as part of a neural, interactive simulation that we call the matrix.\"\nmorpheus then shows neo the world as it truly exists today, a scarred, desolate emptiness with charred, abandoned buildings, black earth, and a shrouded sky. morpheus tells neo that the year is approximately 2199, and humans are fighting against intelligent machines that were created early in the 21st century and have since taken control of the earth's surface. humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations, leaving the earth a devastated ruin. as a last resort, humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines' access to solar power and, in response, the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bio-electric energy. a human's body provides \"more electricity than a 120 volt battery and over 25k btus in body heat.\" morpheus shows neo fields where machines grow human beings, connecting them to their outlets, ensconcing them in their pods, and feeding them with the liquefied remains of other human beings. \"the matrix,\" says morpheus, \"is a computer-generated dreamworld created to keep us under control, to turn us\" into a mere power source, into copper-top batteries. the remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as zion, living a harsh existence on scarce resources.\nthe humans are kept docile within the matrix, a simulated reality of the world as it was in 1999. the matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak, designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified. that simulation is the world neo has been living in since birth. morpheus and his crew belong to a group of free humans who \"unplug\" others from the matrix and recruit them to their rebellion against the machines, and who are able to gain superhuman abilities within the matrix by using their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its physical laws. even so, they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful agents-sentient programs protecting the matrix-and dying in the matrix causes death in the real world. when the matrix was created there was a man born inside it who could create his own reality inside it. it was this man who set morpheus and the others free. when he died, the oracle (gloria foster) prophesied that he would return in another form. and that the return of the one would mean the destruction of the matrix.\nmorpheus liberated neo because he believes him to be \"the one\", a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the matrix and liberate humanity by ending the war with the machines. the next day neo starts his training. tank is his operator. tank and his brother dozer are \"100% pure old-fashioned, homegrown human. born in the real world; a genuine child of zion.\" zion, tank explains, is the last human city, buried deep in the earth, near the core, for warmth. tank straps neo back into the jack-in chair, by-passes some preliminary programs and loads him up with combat training, starting with jiu jitsu. neo is fed a series of martial arts techniques including kempo, tae kwon do, drunken boxing and kung fu. morpheus and tank are amazed at neo's ability to ingest information, but morpheus wants to test neo. morpheus and neo stand in a sparring program. the program has rules, like gravity. but as in many computer programs, some rules can be bent while others can be broken. morpheus bids neo to hit him, if he can. they fight with neo impressively attacking but morpheus easily parrying and subduing him. morpheus ends up kicking neo into a beam, explaining to him that the reason he has beaten him has nothing to do with muscles or reality. neo finally brings a punch near his teacher's face. a \"jump\" program is loaded. both men now stand on one of several tall buildings in a normal city skyline. morpheus tells neo he must free his mind and leaps easily but impossibly from one building to the next. neo nervously tries to follow him and doesn't make the jump, falling to the pavement below.\nmorpheus and neo are walking down a standard city street in what appears to be the matrix. morpheus explains that the matrix is a system and that the system is their enemy. all the people that inhabit it, the people they are trying to free, are part of that system. some are so inert, so dependent upon the matrix that they can never be free. neo asks what the agents are. \"sentient programs,\" says morpheus, that \"can move in and out of any software hard-wired into their system, meaning that they can take over anyone in the matrix program. \"inside the matrix,\" morpheus says, \"they are everyone and they are no one.\" thus morpheus and his crew survive the agents by running from them and hiding from the agents even though they \"are guarding all the doors. they are holding all the keys and sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.\" but no one who has ever stood up to an agent has survived; all have died. still, morpheus is certain that because the agents live in a world of rules that they can never be as strong, never be as fast as he can be. \"what are you trying to tell me,\" asks neo, \"that i can dodge bullets?\" \"when you're ready,\" morpheus says, \"you won't have to.\" the nebuchadnezzar is on alert. they see the holographic image of a squiddy, a search and destroy sentinel, which is on their trail. they set the ship down in a huge sewer system and turn off the power. tank stands at the ready switch of an emp, electro-magnetic pulse, the only weapon man has against the machines in the real world. two squiddies search for the ship -- the crew can see them -- but they move on. cypher meets with agent smith inside the matrix. smith says he wants access codes to the mainframe in zion. cypher says he can't do that, but that he can get him the man who does, meaning morpheus. the deal is that the machines to reinsert his body into a power plant, reinsert him into the matrix, and he'll help the agents. the group enters the matrix to visit the oracle, who predicted the emergence of the one. as they walk out of a warehouse cypher secretly throws his cell phone into the garbage. the oracle, morpheus explains, has been with them since the beginning of the resistance. she is the one who made the prophecy of the one and that morpheus would be the one to find him.\nthe oracle implies that neo is not the one but warns that neo must soon choose between his life and that of morpheus. the group is ambushed by agents and tactical police, leading to the death of the crew member mouse (matt doran). morpheus allows himself to be captured to let neo and the crew escape. their ally cypher (joe pantoliano) had betrayed them.\nmeanwhile, cypher exits the matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others, killing them. before cypher can kill neo and trinity, tank (marcus chong), a subdued crew member, regains consciousness, kills cypher, and safely extracts the survivors. the agents drug and interrogate morpheus in an attempt to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in zion, the humans' subterranean refuge in the real world. he informs morpheus, who is tied to a chair, that the first matrix was designed as a utopia, engineered to make everyone happy. \"it was a disaster,\" says agent smith, people wouldn't accept the program and \"entire crops were lost.\" \"some believed,\" continues smith, \"that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. but i believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was redesigned.\" tank is performing what amounts to last rites for morpheus, laying one hand on his head as his other moves to the back of his skull to remove the jack. just as he's about to pull it out neo stops him. he realizes that the oracle was right. he now has to make the choice to save himself or to save morpheus; his choice is to head back into the matrix. trinity rejects the idea. morpheus gave himself up so that neo could be saved since he is the one. \"i'm not the one, trinity,\" neo says, relaying his understanding of the discussion with the oracle: she did not enlighten him as to whether he was the promised messiah. and, since morpheus was willing to sacrifice himself, neo knows that he must do that same. neo and trinity return to the matrix and rescue their leader; in the process, neo becomes more confident in his ability to manipulate the matrix and is ultimately able to dodge bullets fired at him. morpheus and trinity use a telephone to exit the matrix, but neo is ambushed by agent smith. he stands his ground and defeats smith but flees when the agent possesses another body. meanwhile, in the real world \"sentinel\" machines converge on the nebuchadnezzar. just before reaching another exit, neo is shot and killed by agent smith. trinity, who is standing over neo in the real world, whispers that the oracle told her she would fall in love with the one. she kisses neo and restores his life. neo revives with new power to perceive and control the matrix, and effortlessly destroys agent smith, before returning to the real world in time for the ship's emp weapon to destroy the attacking sentinels. the film ends with neo back in the matrix, making a telephone call promising that he will demonstrate to the people imprisoned in the matrix that \"anything is possible.\" he hangs up the phone and flies into the sky."

Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.<br/><br/>Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.<br/><br/>Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, &quot;we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.&quot; For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie&#39;s sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.<br/><br/>The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer&#39;s harmonies captivated watchers&#39; attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.<br/><br/>Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven&#39;t encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor&#39;s performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.<br/><br/>I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."

      "plot_summary": "In a near-future agrarian United States, former NASA pilot Joseph \"Cooper\" (Cooper) runs a farm in the American Midwest with his daughter Murphy \"Murph\" and son Tom as global crop blight and dust storms steadily make Earth uninhabitable. Murph's bedroom appears haunted by a force that encodes binary coordinates in dust; Cooper and Murph follow them to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand. Brand reveals a wormhole near Saturn that leads to another galaxy and three potentially habitable worlds — Miller, Edmunds, and Mann — surveyed by earlier \"Lazarus\" missions. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the starship Endurance with scientists Amelia Brand (his daughter), Romilly, Doyle, and two robots, TARS and CASE, to retrieve survey data; if one planet is viable, humanity will emigrate on giant space stations. Brand also has a covert \"Plan B\": Endurance carries thousands of frozen human embryos to repopulate a new world if Plan A (solving gravity to lift Earth's population) fails.\n\nCooper leaves Earth after a tearful, estranged parting with Murph. The crew enters the wormhole and first visits Miller's ocean world, which orbits very close to the black hole Gargantua and suffers extreme time dilation (one hour equals seven years on Earth). A landing party is swamped by massive tidal waves; Doyle dies and the mission is delayed. When they return to Endurance, 23 years have elapsed: Murph is now an adult scientist working with Professor Brand to solve a gravity equation needed to launch Earth's population. Brand is aging rapidly; on his deathbed he admits he lied about having a workable Plan A and that Plan B is the real hope.\n\nWith limited fuel, the crew chooses to visit Mann's ice world because Mann's transmission is most recent. On Mann's planet they discover his transmitted data was falsified: Dr. Mann has been lying about habitability to be rescued. Mann attempts to steal a shuttle and abandons Cooper by puncturing his suit; Romilly dies when Mann detonates a device on Endurance. Mann docks improperly with Endurance; the resulting decompression kills Mann and damages the ship. Cooper pilots a crippled shuttle to stabilize Endurance and, together with Amelia, uses a slingshot maneuver around Gargantua to direct Endurance toward Edmunds' planet. To provide the required propulsion and obtain data from the black hole's singularity needed to complete Brand's gravity equation, Cooper and TARS detach and dive into Gargantua, while Amelia continues to Edmunds.\n\nInstead of destruction, Cooper and TARS emerge into a four-dimensional construct — a tesseract — built inside the black hole where time is presented spatially. Cooper recognizes the construct contains scenes from Murph's childhood bedroom across different moments. He realizes the \"ghost\" was him, guided by future humans who engineered the wormhole to allow this intervention. Cooper uses gravitational manipulation in the tesseract to transmit quantum-gravity data (collected by TARS from inside the singularity) to Murph by encoding it in the second hand of her old watch as binary Morse. Murph, now an adult NASA scientist, deciphers the data, completes Brand's equation, and enables humanity's evacuation from Earth onto space stations.\n\nAfter transmitting the data, the tesseract collapses and Cooper is ejected from the black hole; he is rescued and awakens on Cooper Station, a cylindrical space habitat near Saturn. There he reunites with an elderly Murph, who is near death; she tells him to seek Amelia, who transported herself to Edmunds to begin Plan B. The film ends with Cooper stealing a small spacecraft to travel toward Edmunds to find Amelia.",

      "in the future, crop blight has caused civilization to regress into a failing agrarian society. former nasa pilot cooper (matthew mcconaughey) runs a farm with his family. humanity needs more farmers to feed the world & the current scientific thinking believes that nasa apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the soviets (a belief that pisses cooper off like nothing else). murphy (mackenzie foy), cooper's 10-year-old daughter, believes her room is haunted by a ghost trying to communicate with her. cooper also has a son (timothée chalamet) they discover the \"ghost\" is an unknown intelligence sending coded messages using gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in the dust that direct them to a secret nasa installation led by professor john brand (michael caine). dr brand tells cooper that every year one crop dies & gets eliminated from the planet forever due to change in climatic conditions & severity of the dust storms. soon, no crop will ever grow on earth & the species will starve to death. brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence (& first discovered 48 yrs ago), leads to new planets that may offer hope for survival. nasa's \"lazarus missions\" have identified three potentially habitable worlds orbiting the black hole gargantua: miller, edmunds, and mann, named after the astronauts who surveyed them. originally 12 astronauts were sent to 12 different worlds. their craft had hibernation capabilities through which the astronauts could live on for decades & wait to be rescued after transmitting habitat data back to earth. but if the planet was assessed to be uninhabitable, there was no plan for rescue as earth did not have the resources to again visit all 12 planets. brand recruits cooper to pilot the spacecraft endurance to recover the astronauts' data from the 3 planets; if one of the planets is habitable, humanity will follow on space stations. but brand has still not solved the problem of lifting enough of humanity into space & to the identified planet. so plan b is to population bomb the identified planet with human embryos. the endurance will carry 5000 human embryos, of which 10 will be incubated & once they grow up, they will be artificially inseminated so as to create a colony of 100s of humans in a few decades.\ncooper's departure devastates murphy, and they part on bad terms. add something about the video he watches of his son on endurance, cooper joins brand's daughter, bio-technologist amelia (anne hathaway) (& brand's daughter); scientists romilly (david gyasi) and doyle (wes bentley); and robots tars and case. amelia tells cooper that mann was the leader of the expedition that took 12 brave people to uncharted territory. amelia has great respect for mann. they enter the wormhole and head to miller (as the meager data provided by the respective explorers puts miller's planet as the best option), but discover the planet is so close to gargantua that it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: each hour on the surface is seven years on earth. a team descends to the planet, which proves inhospitable as it is covered by a shallow ocean roiled by enormous tidal waves. as amelia attempts to recover miller's data, a wave hits, killing doyle and delaying the shuttle's departure. when the others return to endurance, 23 years have passed. murphy is now grown up & is working with dr brand (who is now very old) in solving the gravity equation that is the key to lifting the humanity off earth in an attempt to recolonize another planet, as per plan a. on earth, the adult murphy (jessica chastain) is now a nasa scientist assisting brand with an equation that will enable nasa to launch the space stations via gravity. on his deathbed, brand admits he already solved the gravity problem and determined that project is impossible as he needed more data from a black hole singularity to completely solve the equation. he concealed his findings to keep hope alive and put his faith in \"plan b\": using frozen embryos aboard the endurance to start humanity anew. he also knew that there was no way back to earth via the wormhole. however, murphy concludes that brand's equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity. low on fuel, endurance can only visit one more planet before returning to earth. after a tense vote, the team selects mann's planet, as mann is still transmitting. amelia wanted to take endurance to edmund's planet as the data showed organic life, but mann's data was more recent (but showed no organic life). amelia's theory was that the 3 planets were orbiting a giant black hole & hence all accidents that happened in the universe to create life, simply did not happen in this system, so no asteroids, comets nothing. her point was that planet showing organic life hence had more promise. however, they discover mann's planet is icy and inhospitable; mann (matt damon) always knew plan b was the mission's true goal (he even tells cooper that brand knew that he needed a black hole's singularity data before mann left earth. and singularity data is impossible as it hides behind a black hole, through which light itself cannot escape). romily suggests that the robot tars can enter the black hole horizon of gargantuan fast enough & just might survive long enough to transmit data on the singularity. mann faked data about his planet's viability so endurance would rescue him. mann breaks cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, and flees to endurance on a shuttle; romilly is killed by a bomb mann set to protect his secret. amelia rescues cooper on the other shuttle, and they arrive at endurance in time to witness mann docking improperly. the airlock explodes, killing mann and causing serious damage, but cooper uses the shuttle to get endurance under control. nearly out of fuel, cooper and amelia plan to slingshot endurance around gargantua on a course toward edmunds. due to being directly in the heavy gravity of gargantua, several more decades actually pass back on earth while tars and cooper detach into the black hole, sacrificing themselves to collect data on the singularity and to propel amelia by dropping the ship's mass. they emerge in an extra-dimensional \"tesseract\", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of murphy's childhood bedroom at various times. cooper realizes the alien beings are future humans who have constructed this space so he can communicate with murphy and save humanity. using gravitational waves, cooper encodes tars's data on the singularity into the adult murphy's watch, allowing her to solve brand's equation and evacuate earth. cooper somehow is ejected from the singularity & awakens aboard a nasa space station near saturn and reunites with the now elderly murphy (ellen burstyn), who has led humanity's exodus. murphy convinces cooper to search for amelia and case, who have completed their one-way trip to edmunds' planet, and are setting plan b into motion."

      "in the near future around the american midwest, cooper, an ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his farming land with his daughter murph and son tom. as devastating sandstorms ravage earth's crops, the people of earth realize their life here is coming to an end as food begins to run out. eventually stumbling upon a n.a.s.a. base 6 hours from cooper's home, he is asked to go on a daring mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole because of cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft unlike the other crew members. in order to find a new home while earth decays, cooper must decide to either stay, or risk never seeing his children again in order to save the human race by finding another habitable planet.",
      "in earth's future, a global crop blight and second dust bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. professor brand, a brilliant n.a.s.a. physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting earth's population to a new home via a womhole. but first, brand must send former n.a.s.a. pilot cooper and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.",
      "a single father that flew for nasa in the past is raising a son and daughter along with his father-in-law. after nasa was cut from governmental funding due to environmental problems, he becomes a farmer. the last sustainable crop is corn and it's only a matter of time until that too becomes extinct. mysterious clues begin emerging that he and his daughter believe are coming from a supernatural being, or aliens. what they decipher leads them to a mission where he leaves the planet and his family to save mankind.",
      "earth, 2067. with widespread famine ravaging humankind and unprecedented blight collapsing the global economies, joseph cooper, a reclusive farmer and father of two, becomes nasa's last hope. as a result, a team of researchers determined to find answers in the vastness of space embarks on a life-and-death mission to discover a compatible new home for the now-endangered human race. but as cooper leaves his family behind in search of opportunities, unfathomable mysteries unfold, and a crucial question arises. are the bold extragalactic explorers prepared to push the limits of knowledge and interstellar travel?"

The director, Denis Villeneuve, is the same guy that did &#39;Arrival&#39; which I thought was good but not as good as other people thought and &#39;Prisoners&#39;. He may be someone to watch. The direction in this is very strong.<br/><br/>They avoided the &#39;let&#39;s do a scene like in first movie but make it BIGGER&#39; ploy that flaws most &#39;sequels&#39;. And it really doesn&#39;t feel like a sequel. It&#39;s a different story and while it builds on the the first it goes in a really interesting direction. I liked also that Deckard&#39;s role wasn&#39;t tacked on as an after thought. It&#39;s really sort of poetic and I&#39;d like to see it again so I can get some of things I didn&#39;t get in the first go around. I gave it a 9 but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s going to change to a 10 with a little time. <br/><br/>It really holds it&#39;s on in comparison with the original and if this is the approach they want to take with a possible 3rd movie I&#39;m totally on board."

        "summary": "This was special",
        "text": "It&#39;s amazing after repeated viewings the lack of patience or inability moviegoers have to simply follow a plot. The lack of concentration throughout the cinema, the talking throughout and some of the comments I have read is downright disturbing. This movie is high art and some people need it spoon-feed to them. If you&#39;re not invested from the get-go, just go home.<br/><br/>Blade Runner 2049 is not your typical movie and it was never meant to be. There are no superheroes or giant robots. Explosions are scarce and it&#39;s not funny either. It&#39;s about emotion and memories and like the original Blade Runner (1982). It poses the same Philip K Dick inspired questions about humanity - what does it mean to be human and are we just the sum of our memories? It now raises questions about artificial intelligence and real love.<br/><br/>It is a sequel 35 years in the making to one of the most thoughtful and provocative movies ever. The original movie was a box office flop which later developed a cult following and and has since been hailed a masterpiece. Ridley Scott created a multilayered world which seduces you into a nostalgic like trance for a place which never really existed and a sequel to a film held in such high regard is rarely ever a good idea but Blade Runner 2049 is a rare exception. Think The Godfather Part II, Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgment Day before it.<br/><br/>No spoilers. We follow Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a new character and a new breed of Blade Runner on the trail of an old model replicant but what he uncovers along the way is so much bigger and threatens to shift the balance of what is left of humanity.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) and his crew have crafted a beautiful looking film which pays homage to the original without trying to copy it at all. The same rain-soaked, neon-lit streets are present in L.A, only the Eco-system is even more shattered. Sustenance is scarce with protein farming a way of life and while there are obvious nods to the first movie 2049 relishes the opportunity to avoid the familiar and takes us outside the city limits.<br/><br/>The cast in 2049 is excellent. Ryan Gosling carries the main story with ease, playing his detective character with an ice-cold calm until...<br/><br/>Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, the original Blade Runner delivers a highly emotional and raw performance which I found very surprising. Not because Ford is not capable as an actor but Deckard was played so dryly in the original, especially next to Rutger Hauer&#39;s Roy Batty. Clearly time and circumstance have clearly changed him here and it&#39;s a refreshing approach.<br/><br/>The casting choices of side characters in limited roles such as Dave Bautista, Robin Wright and Ana De Armas in her very unique role were fantastic. Jared Leto gets only a few scenes as villainous creeper Niander Wallace, the corporate tycoon with a god complex but his best &#39;angel&#39;, Luv (Sylvia Hoek) gets plenty and rightfully so because she&#39;s excellent.<br/><br/>If I I had to choose any negatives from 2049 it would be need to spoon-feed the audience in scenes by adding a small flashback here and there which I thought was unnecessary. The score was clearly not Vangelis who did the first movie and made up so much of the nostalgic atmosphere in it. While good I did miss the sadness, the piano keys and blues of Vangelis for a time but could tell the score was aiming for something different, more urgent, a sense of dread which was probably more appropriate anyway with 2049 being much larger. That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t hints of Vangelis because there most definitely is.<br/><br/>It has been 35 years and the need for a sequel can be debated forever. Was it necessary? No. But was it good. Yes, really good. Is it a masterpiece? I would say that it&#39;s an extremely satisfying conclusion to Deckard&#39;s story and having seen it it&#39;s made the original even better.<br/><br/>A movie like this does not come around very often. The world needs more movies like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Ex Machina... and Blade Runner 2049. High praise.<br/><br/>Best movie of the year!"

Lots of repetitive 2 and 3 stars reviews that all read like they&#39;re written by the same person.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a relief they still make movies like this; movies for adults. Yes it&#39;s a sequel, but it&#39;s quality and it stands on its own. This is real sci-fi, made with a proper budget and brought to life by artists. It&#39;s serious and paced so that you have time to think. If you&#39;re a fan of the genre and can appreciate some ambiguity and a little space for questions to breathe then I think you will appreciate this film. But if you can&#39;t remember the last time you read a book then maybe you will find this movie long and boring.<br/><br/>The cast, acting, and plot are all quite good with only a few misses. The soundtrack doesn&#39;t blow me away but it&#39;s suitable. The visuals are incredible though and where this movie really shines; I can&#39;t think of a single moment in the film where I felt like the vision was held back by the technology available. And the scene at K&#39;s apartment with Joi (you will know it when you see it) pushed the envelope of what I thought was possible to do in a film. This one is a real stunner visually. Like the original, I expect Blade Runner 2049 to hold up extremely well over time."

As with the original Blade Runner the visuals are the ones that people will refer to when it comes to this movie. And it&#39;s not just because of the Academy Awards. You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).<br/><br/>Having said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.<br/><br/>While it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it. If that sounds intriguing to you, with some added social commentary flavor, than by all means watch it. But beware that you have to have patience with it ..."

        "text": "It&#39;s 2049 Los Angeles. K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner hunting for old Nexus 8 replicants under LAPD Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). After the 2022 blackout, most records have been erased or corrupted. Tyrell is out of business and replicant production had been outlawed until Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace is producing a new obedient replicant. Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is his replicant henchwoman. K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K&#39;s holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.<br/><br/>This is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original&#39;s visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.<br/><br/>The original&#39;s detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins&#39; work is beyond beautiful. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. Gosling is a more effective lead. Ford comes in during the second half and is a more fun Deckard. Ana de Armas is a gorgeous vision of girl perfection. Sylvia Hoeks is an amazing villain. The movie tackles all of the ideas without hitting one over the head. This is a great film although I&#39;m not sure if popular modern audience will take to it. The opening box office certainly does not suggest that."

        "text": "Denis Villeneuve is today without any doubt the most prominent Canadian director. In recent years he was mostly active in the crime (&quot;Prisoners&quot; (2013) and &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015)) and science fiction (&quot;Arrival&quot; (2016), &quot;Blade runner 2049&quot; (2017), &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;Dune part II&quot; (2024)) genre.<br/><br/>It requires a lot of courage to make a sequel to such a cult classic as &quot;Blade runner&quot; (1982, Ridley Scott). &quot;Blade runner 2049&quot; is situated, as the title already indicates, in 2049 and therefore 30 years after the story of &quot;Blade runner&quot;.<br/><br/>The theme however has remained the same, the fear of robots taking over. This fear is with the discussions about Artificial Intelligence in 2024 even more relevant than it was at the time of release of &quot;Blade runner 2049&quot;.<br/><br/>Relevance is however not the same as originality. In &quot;Blade runner&quot; (1982) the fear of Robots taking over was further elaborated upon in the fear that they could adjust their own expiration date. In &quot;Blade runner 2049&quot; (2017) it is the fear that they can reproduce. Variation within a theme.<br/><br/>The cinematography is brilliant, perfectioning the decadent atmosphere of the 1982 film and having 3D technology as an extra. A very good performance by cinematographer Roger Deakins. Nevertheless the overall impression I got after seeing this film was that it is too much style over substance."

        "summary": "A Visually Striking Sequel that is Well Worth Your Time",
        "text": "Visually the movie floored me. There&#39;s clearly so much intentionality and careful effort and planning that went into making that world. Villeneuve blended call backs to the original while still making this his own vision. I&#39;ll see anything he makes because I always feel like I&#39;m in good hands with his movies, right from the opening scene.<br/><br/>The music had a similar feel to the visuals in that they blended old and new. The iconic &quot;Tears in Rain&quot; melody receives a much-deserved return in a delightfully appropriate moment. I&#39;ll give the movie serious props for providing a comforting level of nostalgia without ever feeling that it pandered.<br/><br/>Joi (Ana de Armas) and Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) were fantastic in their own very different ways. Joi, who plays Gosling&#39;s love interest of sorts, is essentially Samantha in Her, except she is a holographic projection instead of only a voice. Luv is Jared Leto&#39;s favorite replicant assistant and a total ice queen.<br/><br/>Gosling was cool and dutiful, though kind of lifeless, which I guess was on purpose since he plays a replicant (or does he?) Juxtaposing him with Harrison Ford really made the subtleties of Ford&#39;s performance stand out in a way that was absent for Gosling. But Gosling was still very handsome and that worked well with the rest of the movie, which is striking and beautiful.<br/><br/>Even though I didn&#39;t feel bored during any of the 164 minutes, I often felt like nothing was really happening. Even at the end I wondered what was the point. I know it was a character exploration of K (Gosling), like the first was of Deckard, and he clearly grew during the story. Still, the movie overall came across to me as heavy on striking visuals and light on substance.<br/><br/>Perhaps I&#39;m demanding too much. While I enjoyed the heck out of the movie and would watch it again in a second, it fell slightly short of the profound best picture level movie that I hoped it would be. Somewhere in the two hour and 44 minute runtime is a great two hour movie trying to emerge.<br/><br/>All things considered, it&#39;s a pleasing complement to the original and is well worth a night in the theater."

        "summary": "One of the best sequels of all time",
        "text": "Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!<br/><br/>I have seen this film three times in the cinema, in 3D, 2D and 4DX.<br/><br/>And one of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it&#39;s not the time in the cinema that takes up my time, It&#39;s the hours upon hours in between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer. This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape. And I&#39;ve gone back to the cinema twice to be &quot;tortured&quot;, but it&#39;s worth it.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a possible near future where the human race is hanging by their fingertips on the edge of doom. So it&#39;s quite depressing. But it&#39;s so brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>Many Stanley Kubrick films were also &quot;hated&quot; by many when they first released. &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; for example, which had gorgeous visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers back then. But what Kubrick did best with his films, was to create afterthought. People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, this movie will without doubt live on to be interpreted, analyzed and discussed for decades to come. The story continues from the original, but stands completely on it&#39;s own, it tells a new story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to be a copy, it&#39;s a natural continuation in the same universe. You don&#39;t have to see the original Blade Runner first, though i do recommend it, see the final cut.<br/><br/>BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league entirely. It&#39;s confusing to look at something so gorgeous, whilst painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides with your senses, your eyes say it&#39;s beautiful, your mind say it&#39;s depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean? At least don&#39;t confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is bad, it&#39;s nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then you will know how it feels to be a replicant that&#39;s trapped in a caged mind.<br/><br/>BR2049&#39;s story happens 30 years after the original, and there is three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019 and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of the things going on. But the underlying theme is the same as it was in the original. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have memories? What is a soul? And so on.<br/><br/>The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control, almost all animals and plants have died. People are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is looming just around every corner. Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049 takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been able to perfect, and that&#39;s what the main story is all about, and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the &quot;technology&quot;, which will result in him becoming many hundred times richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself, and he calls his replicants angels.<br/><br/>And of course he also uses replicants to do his &quot;dirty work&quot;. In 2049 we meet his right hand &quot;girl&quot; Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks, if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it&#39;s her). Luv is a &quot;handygirl&quot; so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can&#39;t spoil anything, but look closely at Luv&#39;s character arc. All the other actors also do an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can&#39;t talk about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.<br/><br/>Be prepared going to see this film, it&#39;s depressing and heavy on your mind, and it demands your full attention. It&#39;s one of those rare films who dares to challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155 million dollar risk at that. The film isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s close, and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting, every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.<br/><br/>I loved this film, it&#39;s the best film I&#39;ve seen all year, It is a must see, a monumental triumph of a film that&#39;s just as good (possibly even better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!<br/><br/>9.7/10 - Masterpiece<br/><br/>And BTW Villeneuve&#39;s next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I&#39;m going to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn."

      "plot_summary": "In 2049 Los Angeles, LAPD blade runner KD6-3.7, called K, a Nexus-9 replicant, locates and 'retires' rogue replicant Sapper Morton at his protein farm. In Morton's yard K finds a buried wooden box containing the remains of a female replicant who died during childbirth and an encoded date carved into a tree: 6-10-21. Lieutenant Joshi orders K to recover and destroy any evidence and locate the child, because proof that replicants can reproduce could spark war. K runs the remains through DNA archives at the Wallace Corporation and learns the corpse is Rachael, a Nexus-7 who disappeared with former blade runner Rick Deckard in 2019. Niander Wallace, CEO of Wallace Corporation, wants the reproduction secret; he sends his enforcer Luv to monitor K. K recalls a childhood memory — a wooden toy horse and an orphanage — and believes it connects him to the case. His holographic companion Joi encourages the idea that K might be Rachael's child, because implanted memories that feel real could mean he was born, not manufactured.\n\nK tracks orphanage records and finds two birth entries for June 10, 2021 with identical DNA except sex chromosomes; only the boy is listed as living. K locates the living child, takes him briefly to an orphanage, and later, after visiting memory designer Dr. Ana Stelline in San Diego and failing a baseline test, learns Stelline confirms the authenticity of the orphanage memory. Believing he is Rachael and Deckard's son, K becomes obsessed; Lieutenant Joshi gives him 48 hours to pass his next baseline or be retired.\n\nTo get closer to leads in the Los Angeles projects, K hires replicant sex worker Mariette to appear as Joi so he can have sex with the real Mariette; Mariette, at Joi's prompting, plants a tracker on K. The tracker lets the Replicant Freedom Movement (aka Replicant Underground) locate K when he is ambushed. K deciphers the toy horse's origin to an irradiated Las Vegas and travels there, encountering the Underground’s leader Freysa. In Las Vegas, K finds Deckard living in hiding; Deckard reveals he and Rachael had a child and that Deckard scrambled the birth records to conceal the child's identity, leaving the child with the Underground. Deckard refuses to reveal the child's location.\n\nLuv, pursuing K, kills Lieutenant Joshi and then follows K to Las Vegas. Luv captures Deckard and delivers him to Wallace, who wants Deckard to reveal the child's whereabouts; Wallace offers Deckard a fabricated Rachael in exchange. Deckard refuses; Luv murders the replica Rachael. K fights Luv, is beaten and left for dead, but is rescued by the Replicant Underground using Mariette's tracker. Freysa tells K that Rachael's child is actually a daughter — Dr. Ana Stelline — not the boy K found. The Underground expected K to kill Deckard to prevent Wallace from getting Stelline; they ask K to do it. K refuses.\n\nLuv abducts Deckard aboard a Wallace transport bound off-world. K intercepts, battles Luv on the transport, and drowns Luv in the sea but suffers severe injuries. K stages Deckard's death to protect him, takes Deckard to Dr. Ana Stelline's facility in Los Angeles, and gives Deckard the wooden toy horse as proof. Deckard enters Stelline's clean-room; he sees his grown daughter, Ana Stelline, for the first time and embraces her. K, mortally wounded, collapses on the steps outside in falling synthetic snow and dies as Deckard looks on.",

This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. \nThe child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (&quot;I threw up.&quot; &quot;Well that&#39;s ok! That happens sometimes&quot;-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). \nAnother extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. \nAs a classic worldwide, it&#39;s no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow."

True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg&#39;s magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I&#39;ve seen with great acting by children. Spielberg&#39;s camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs&#39; &quot;interaction&quot; with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride."

I swear, listen to it more than once, and you&#39;re bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It&#39;s that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn&#39;t this movie&#39;s strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!<br/><br/>Anyway, I think I&#39;ve made my point.

Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&#39;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&#39;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.<br/><br/>This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&#39;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&#39;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&#39;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&#39;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.<br/><br/>This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&#39;t bad, but the third wasn&#39;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.<br/><br/>The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&#39;s life is at stake.<br/><br/>The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.<br/><br/>Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&#39;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.<br/><br/>Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.<br/><br/>Enjoy"

How on Earth it is only rated as 7.9/10 I&#39;ll never know.<br/><br/>It has a great plot, structured of course around Michael Crichton&#39;s equally brilliant novel, and the graphics are absolutely superb. Jurassic Park, along with the sequel &#39;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&#39;, had Dinosaurs that were actually convincing. Of course, there was some artistic license involved - certain behaviours of the animals were exaggerated or entirely fabricated - but that in no way detracts from the film. They are certainly better than those in the comparably average third instalment in the franchise, &#39;Jurassic Park III&#39;. Living in the 21st century (or 20th, as it were) this film gave us a recreation of these creatures that was genuinely believable.<br/><br/>For all their fancy graphics and obscene budgets, films such as &#39;Avatar&#39; will never compare to the likes of Jurassic Park."

Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn&#39;t matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die."

        "text": "&#39;Jurassic Park (1993)&#39; is a landmark achievement, in as many ways as possible. While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don&#39;t hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I&#39;ve ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick&#39;s fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you&#39;re really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It&#39;s difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It&#39;s almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It&#39;s also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven&#39;t, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I&#39;ve ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it&#39;s so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper &#39;summer blockbuster&#39; that&#39;s incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10"

        "text": "I don&#39;t know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.<br/><br/>Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don&#39;t know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....<br/><br/>Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can&#39;t act, getting terrified by monsters that don&#39;t really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don&#39;t like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the &quot;life will find a way&quot; speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.<br/><br/>Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.<br/><br/>10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)"

Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough&#39;s new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.

      "plot_summary": "On Isla Nublar, industrialist John Hammond has built Jurassic Park, a theme park populated by cloned dinosaurs created from DNA recovered from amber. After a worker is killed by a velociraptor, Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler, along with chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm and lawyer Donald Gennaro, to inspect and certify the park for investors. At the visitor center they see living dinosaurs (including a brachiosaurus) and witness a velociraptor hatching; Dr. Henry Wu explains gaps in the genomes were filled with frog DNA and claims all specimens were engineered female. Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy, join the group for a guided electric tour overseen from the control room. During the tour a sick triceratops delays Sattler and the approaching tropical storm forces most staff to evacuate to the mainland. Lead programmer Dennis Nedry, bribed to steal fertilized embryos, disables the park's security systems to access the embryo storage, deactivating electric fences and tour vehicles as he leaves the control room. Stranded near the Tyrannosaurus rex paddock by the outage, the tour vehicles are attacked: the T. rex destroys a vehicle, kills Gennaro, injures Malcolm, and Grant escapes into the park with Lex and Tim. Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes, and is killed by a dilophosaurus after his embryo canister is stolen by a Komodo-like thief (in his jeep). Hammond, Sattler and staff learn Nedry locked the system; Raymond Arnold attempts a hard reboot but the shutdown opens other fences and releases velociraptors. Muldoon and Sattler search the maintenance sheds; Muldoon distracts raptors and is killed, Sattler finds Arnold's severed arm and narrowly survives a raptor attack. Grant, Lex and Tim shelter in trees, discover broken eggs and realize dinosaurs have been breeding because frog DNA allowed sex changes. Grant finds Tim electrocuted on a fence and resuscitates him with CPR. The visitor center becomes a refuge; Grant goes searching for Sattler and returns with her. Lex, who can use the park's computer, restores power in the control room, allowing Hammond to call for help. As the group attempts to flee through the park entrance, they are cornered by velociraptors in the visitor center kitchen; a returning Tyrannosaurus rex attacks and kills the raptors, giving the survivors time to reach the rendezvous. Hammond, Malcolm and the others arrive; the survivors board a helicopter and leave Isla Nublar.",

      "industrialist john hammond (richard attenborough) has created a theme park of cloned dinosaurs, jurassic park, on isla nublar, a fictional island off the costa rican coast. after a dinosaur handler is killed by a velociraptor, the park's investors, represented by lawyer donald gennaro (martin ferrero), demand that experts visit the park and certify its safety. gennaro invites mathematician and chaos-theorist ian malcolm (jeff goldblum), while hammond invites paleontologist dr. alan grant (sam neill) and paleobotanist dr. ellie sattler (laura dern). alan is a \"digger\". he is a hands-on paleontologist and doesn't like machine as they malfunction in his presence. hammond lures him away from his site with a sizable research grant that would cover his expenses for the next 3 yrs.\nupon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live brachiosaurus. at the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur dna from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. dna from frogs was used to fill in gaps in the genome of the dinosaurs, and to prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female by direct chromosome manipulation. the group witnesses the hatching of a baby velociraptor and visits the raptor enclosure. dr. henry wu (bd wong) tells the group that there is unauthorized breeding in jurassic park since all the dinosaurs are engineered to be females. alan is alarmed to know that hammond and his team have bred raptors at the park. alan learns that the raptors have problem solving intelligence.\ngennaro is sold on the park. but during lunch, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park; malcolm warns about the implications of genetic engineering and scoffs at the park's conceptualization, saying that it will inevitably break down. dinosaurs had their shot and nature selected them for extinction. malcolm is worried about humans and dinosaurs coming together at the same time, when they were separated by millions of yrs of evolution. the group is joined by hammond's grandchildren, lex (ariana richards) and tim murphy (joseph mazzello), for a tour of the park, while hammond oversees the tour from the control room. it is implied that dennis bid for the network contract of jurassic park and is not happy with the roi. hammond ignores him and says his financial problems are his own to handle. the entire programming is buggy, and hammond notes 151 bugs before the tour program have even left the visitor center.\nthe tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick triceratops; it is cut short as a tropical storm approaches isla nublar. most of the park employees leave for the mainland on a boat while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles, except sattler, who stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study a sick triceratops. jurassic park's disgruntled lead computer programmer, dennis nedry (wayne knight), has been bribed by dodgson (cameron thor) (dennis took $750k upfront and $50k upon delivery of each viable embryo), a man working for hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and stores the embryos inside a container disguised as a shaving cream can. nedry's sabotage also cuts power to the tour vehicles, stranding them just as they near the park's tyrannosaurus rex paddock. the phones are out and hammond can't call for help.\nmost of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the group. after the tyrannosaurus overturns a tour vehicle, it injures malcolm and devours gennaro, while grant, lex and tim escape. on his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his jeep wrangler, and is killed by a dilophosaurus.\nmeanwhile sattler reaches the control tower and understands from hammond what dennis has done. hammond tells sattler that \"next time it will be all perfect\".. sattler helps the game warden, robert muldoon (bob peck), search for survivors; they recover an injured malcolm, but are chased away by the returning tyrannosaurus before they can find grant, tim, and lex, who take shelter in a treetop and encounter a brachiosaurus. those three later discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs, and grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog dna-some west african frogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well. unable to decipher nedry's code to reactivate the security system, hammond and chief engineer ray arnold (samuel l. jackson) reboot the park's system. the group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. when arnold fails to return, sattler and muldoon head to the shed. they discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the velociraptors. muldoon distracts the raptors, while sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering arnold's severed arm. meanwhile, muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by the other two raptors. grant, tim, and lex manage to escape the fenced areas just before the power is switched back on (tim got a massive jolt as he was still on the fence but was revived by grant using cpr) & reach the visitor center. grant heads out to look for sattler, leaving tim and lex inside. tim and lex are pursued by the raptors in a kitchen, but they escape and join grant and sattler, who have returned. the group reaches the control room and lex uses a computer to restore the park's power, allowing them to call hammond, who calls for help. as they try to escape by the front entrance, they are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the tyrannosaurus appears and kills the raptors. hammond arrives in a jeep with malcolm, and the group boards a helicopter to leave the island."

        "text": "An intriguing, challenging and original story focussing on Louise Banks (Amy Adams) a preeminent linguistics professor who must lead humanity in communicating with visiting aliens. It is not Independence Day style all-guns-blazing and action, but rather a thoughtful character driven movie. Adams is fabulous as the protagonist demonstrating bewilderment, perseverance and awe in coming to terms with the aliens&#39; strange language and the impact it has on her. She carries the movie single-handed.<br/><br/>The language is the key and changes the way Louise, and perhaps the world, will view things forever and this impact is beautifully demonstrated through the original use of non-linear scenes. The effects the aliens use to write are superb, though understated, like a sort of coalescing squid ink.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning with an original take on visiting spaceships and aliens avoiding lazy humanoid with antennae in flying saucers tropes. The presentation of the complex linguistic challenges, their initial meaning and far-reaching consequences is superb. The subtle meaning of this is difficult to explore without massive use of exposition, but somehow this is achieved with none and the message is shining bright.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

This is a true love story. Not a romance, but as the Greek call it, Agape. The highest form of love. She knows how her story ends, but she chooses to relive her fate.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t really want to give anything critical away here because this movie needs to be watched, and it needs to be felt. Anyone who has had pain, disappointments, or regrets, needs to watch this movie for its beautiful message, and enjoy it for what it is- a well made movie that is unique and beautiful in every way, something sorely lacking in Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>One note: Max Richter&#39;s &quot;On The Nature of Daylight&quot; was perfectly utilized in this film, I truly do not think the moment it was used would not be as impactful if not for this beautiful song. The end was definitely the highlight of the film, and when you hear the faint, weeping strings come in, it&#39;s almost automatic, you begin to feel like the events that are unfolding are happening to you. Truly a remarkable film in every way."

Denis Villeneuve directs this film with a gripping realism. The score is haunting and otherworldly at the same time, perfect for the subject matter. The story utilizes the concept of time brilliantly, almost like it&#39;s another character.<br/><br/>This is a sci-fi drama. It&#39;s not an action film. It&#39;s an intimate study that shy&#39;s away from big theatrics, instead opting for a philosophical discussion that challenges the viewer. The twist is beautiful and heartbreaking. I love that this film makes you think, it&#39;s what great sci-fi is suppose to do.<br/><br/>Watch this."

        "text": "&quot;I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We&#39;re so bound by time&quot;, Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they&#39;re here. As she learns more she discovers that they don&#39;t think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use &quot;the weapon&quot;.<br/><br/>There&#39;s dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it&#39;s the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we&#39;ve seen a thousand times. It&#39;s much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10"

The point is all those stories had characters and people and objects and places and things that I could either imagine or something that I could picture and understand and visualize in my young mind. If not for those imaginable characters and people, I would have never understood those stories, the true meaning of the story, the actual story behind the story that my dad probably wanted me to understand.<br/><br/>Arrival, for me is such a story. Aliens are just fun characters that help me understand the story so I can actually see beyond it and understand the untold story. You see, the way I understand it is that the director had to dumb it down for us and wrap this movie in a sci-fi genre and add aliens so you could relate it to something you are familiar with and hoped, really hoped that we try to understand the true purpose, the message behind all this. It simply couldn&#39;t have been portrayed better than this!<br/><br/>This movie teaches you a lot of things, if you are ready to learn.

Prisoners, Sicario and now Arrival (haven&#39;t seen Enemy yet, or some of his earlier work). Denis knows how to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored."

      "plot_summary": "Twelve oval alien spacecraft appear simultaneously around the world; one lands in Montana. The U.S. Army assembles a small research team at the Montana site led by Colonel G.T. Weber who recruits linguist Dr. Louise Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly to decipher the aliens' purpose. Inside the craft humans encounter two seven-limbed heptapods (nicknamed Abbott and Costello) that produce complex circular written logograms. Louise insists on direct, repeated interaction to build a translation system; she removes protective gear to get closer and compiles the heptapod writing into a shared lexicon with Ian. As she studies their written language she begins experiencing vivid personal visions of a little girl growing up and dying of cancer. Military and political tensions mount worldwide after an early translation of the heptapods' phrase “offer weapon” (also read elsewhere as “use weapon”) sparks fear; China and other nations threaten or prepare attacks and international collaboration fractures. Louise and Ian are inside the ship when rogue soldiers detonate explosives; both are ejected and knocked unconscious but survive. Back at camp, Ian discovers that the heptapod logograms encode a radically different relation to time—references to a non-linear perception and a recurring symbol for time present across messages. Louise realizes the heptapods' written language rearranges cognition so that learners experience future events as memories. She returns alone to the craft where Costello explains (via gestures and new logograms) that the heptapods have come to give humanity their language as a “tool” (misread earlier as “weapon”)—a gift that will enable humans to help the heptapods three thousand years in the future. Louise understands her visions are flash-forwards: the little girl she has been seeing will be her future daughter, Hannah, who does not yet exist and will later die young. In a future vision at a U.N. reception General Shang thanks Louise for convincing him not to attack; he reveals she had called him on his private number and repeated his late wife's last words in Mandarin, which persuaded him. In the present Louise steals a satellite phone, places the call to Shang and—using the Mandarin phrase from her vision—convinces him to stand down; China calls off its attack and global cooperation resumes. The aliens depart peacefully. Louise later publishes a book on the heptapod language (The Universal Language). Ian confesses love to Louise; she chooses to have a child with him despite knowing, from her acquired non-linear knowledge, that their daughter Hannah will be born, die of cancer at age twelve, and that Ian will eventually leave them. The film ends with Louise holding Hannah as a child, fully aware of the future she has accepted.",

      "linguist louise banks (amy adams) is caring for her adolescent daughter, who dies of cancer at the age of twelve. louise laments that human beings are bound by time and its linear order, as she relives the memories of her daughter as she was born, grew up and eventually passed away. while she is lecturing at a university, twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear, each landing in a different country. in the ensuing widespread panic, affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them.\nlouise is puzzled about why the aliens sent 12 spacecraft if the objective was to make an initial contact. the craft in us has landed in montana. the president declares a state of emergency, and all air traffic is grounded. panic buying all utilities and groceries ensues. u.s. army colonel weber (forest whitaker) asks louise to join physicist ian donnelly (jeremy renner) (an experimental physicist from los alamos) to decipher their language and find out why they have come to earth. 2 years ago, louise did some farsi interpretation for army intelligence and already has top secret clearance. weber shares an audio file of an interaction with the aliens, but louise says that to interpret their language, she needs to be there and interact directly. the team is brought to a u.s. military camp in montana near one of the spacecrafts and makes contact with two seven-limb aliens on board. the spacecraft itself is oval in shape and stands on its vertical axis. there is an open door at the bottom of the ship, which is accessible via a tall crane. once inside the door, the gravity changes from vertical to horizontal and louise and team are able to walk normally on the \"vertical\" walls inside the chamber. at the end is a glass-like structure beyond which the aliens \"arrive\" to interact with the humans. weber is nervous about louise's approach and wants to know why the aliens came to earth and what are their intentions. louise says that when cook reached australia, he saw a strange animal and asked an aboriginal native what the animal was called. the native said \"kangaroo\" and the name stuck. only kangaroo means \"i don't understand\". she says that it is important to take time and understand the language so that more complex communications are not misinterpreted, later on. louise removes her protective gear in subsequent sessions and interacts more closely with the heptapods.\nthey call the extraterrestrials \"heptapods\", and ian nicknames them abbott and costello. at first the team focuses on the audio cues from the heptapods to try and figure out their language. louise believes that the aliens might have a form of written language.\nlouise shows them a placard with the word \"human\" written on it, and the aliens respond with a written phrase of their own. the writing happens with an ink secreted from their limbs. banks and donnelly research the complex written language of the heptapods, consisting of\npalindromic phrases written with circular symbols, and share the results with other nations. as banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter. when louise asks what the aliens want, they answer: \"offer weapon\". a similar translation \"use weapon\" is made by one of the other sites in china. fear of a potential threat from the aliens leads other nations to close down communications on the project, and some prepare their military for attack. however, louise thinks that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" might have an alternative translation, such as \"tool\" or \"technology\".\nchina's translation likely results from interacting with the heptapods using mahjong, a highly competitive game. rogue u.s. soldiers plant explosives in the spacecraft. unaware, louise and ian re-enter. the aliens give them a much larger and more complex message. abbott ejects ian and louise from the craft as the explosion occurs, which leaves them unconscious. louise and ian come round in the camp as the military prepares to evacuate, and the spacecraft moves higher above the ground. general shang issues an ultimatum to the alien craft in china, demanding that it leave within 24 hours. russia, pakistan, and sudan follow suit; communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in. donnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3d space into which it is projected. banks suggests that the full message is split between the twelve craft and that the heptapods want all the nations to collaborate in order to decipher it. meanwhile, china notifies the world that its military is planning to attack the spacecraft off its coast. louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. she meets costello, who communicates that abbott is dying. louise asks about her visions of a daughter (whom she doesn't recognize), and costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing that her \"visions\" were not flashbacks but flash-forwards.\nlearning the language alters humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience memories of future events. banks's visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future. costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the \"weapon\" or \"tool\" because it changes the mind's perception of time. the aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. they ask her to use her \"weapon\"-her ability to see into the future. banks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells donnelly that the aliens' language is the \"tool\" that was meant by the word \"weapon\".\nshe has a vision of herself at a future united nations reception, being thanked by the chinese general shang (tzi ma) for convincing him to suspend the military attack. he explains that she had called his private mobile telephone. he shows her its number, which he says he knows he must do without understanding why. in the present, louise steals a satellite phone and calls shang but realizes she does not know what to say. her vision continues with shang explaining that she had convinced him by repeating his wife's last words in mandarin, which he tells louise. this convinces shang in present time, and the chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from earth. from what she has learned, banks writes and publishes a book called the universal language, a guide to the heptapod language, which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the heptapods. during the evacuation, donnelly expresses his love for banks. they talk about their life choices and whether he would change them if he could see his life from beginning to end. banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that hannah will die from an incurable disease and that donnelly will leave them both as a result of her revealing that she knew this."

Every tragedy compounded onto one another in such an easing way. Annie&#39;s deterioration due to the grief of her dead abusive mother and daughter was fascinating. The dinner scene where she screams at her son for killing their child was heart wrenching. Every step of the way I was always wondering what next event would be their mothers snapping point.<br/><br/>Then the movie concluded and it was a demon possessing the family all along. The plot that I fell in love with was the intricate and complicated relationships between the family. Learning that a lot of the tension derived from an outside force was disappointing. The name of the movie was &#39;hereditary&#39; and through my investment I wanted the horror of the movie to be found in how dangerous their relationships with each other are. While disappointed with the cult at the center of the family&#39;s heart, I could never fully hate this movie for its brilliant acting and expert cinematography."

        "text": "In many ways, Hereditary is the horror movie I&#39;ve been restlessly waiting to see for so many years. Despite my avid fandom for the genre, I really feel that modern horror has lost its grasp on how to make a film that&#39;s truly unsettling in the way the great classic horror films are. A modern wide-release horror film is often nothing more than a conveyor belt of jump scares strung together with a derivative story which exists purely as a vehicle to deliver those jump scares. They&#39;re more carnival rides than they are films, and audiences have been conditioned to view and judge them through that lens. The modern horror fan goes to their local theater and parts with their money on the expectation that their selected horror film will &quot;deliver the goods&quot;, so to speak: startle them a sufficient number of times (scaling appropriately with the film&#39;s runtime, of course) and give them the money shots (blood, gore, graphic murders, well-lit and up-close views of the applicable CGI monster etc.) If a horror movie fails to deliver those goods, it&#39;s scoffed at and falls into the &quot;worst film I&#39;ve ever seen&quot; category. I put that in quotes because a disgruntled filmgoer behind me broadcasted those exact words across the theater as the credits for this film rolled. He really wanted us to know his thoughts.<br/><br/>Like similarly fantastic and crowd-displeasing horror films of the past few years, The Witch and It Comes At Night, Hereditary is a film that largely deals in atmosphere and emotional horror. The Shining, which happens to be my favorite horror film, is a clear touchstone and I would go as far as saying that this is the first modern horror film I&#39;ve seen that genuinely captures a similar tone and ethos. Much like that film, it delivers its horror through an intensifying sense of unease and dread that becomes nearly suffocating by its conclusion. Rather than startling you with cheap scares, it offers haunting and upsetting images which are often delivered without any of those overused sonic jolts. Perhaps most importantly, it anchors everything in an emotional core with nuanced characters who experience relatable family struggles and grief. And that is absolutely critical to what makes the movie effective and resonant: it works on a metaphorical level, using the supernatural story as a vehicle to explore the very real way in which a family can be absolutely ravaged by tragedy, and furthermore how trauma and mental illness are passed through the generations. I&#39;d be remiss not to mention that Toni Collette gives a mesmerizing performance in this film that is absolutely unhinged and truly difficult to stomach at times.<br/><br/>For all that praise and as excellent as I think it is, Hereditary isn&#39;t quite a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I was very much invested and riveted throughout the length of the film, there were some detectable pacing issues. I feel conflicted in saying that because I&#39;m very much a fan of the slow-burn horror style which benefits from a deliberate pace, but I did get the occasional nagging sense that things could&#39;ve been tightened up just a tad without losing the effect. Some of the scares in the film, often the more &quot;traditional&quot; horror moments, also struck slightly the wrong note with me on a first viewing and were just a hair too campy or on-the-nose given how visionary and restrained the majority of the film is. And in its ending few minutes, the film really shows its full hand when a bit more ambiguity may have served it better.<br/><br/>The positives far, far outweigh the negatives here though and Hereditary is ultimately a remarkable debut horror film which showcases what the genre is capable of when it&#39;s taken seriously by a talented director. Here&#39;s hoping we&#39;ll continue to see more like it.<br/><br/>Light 4.5/5"

This is more of a story of grief and not knowing what ones own ancestry has been up to told in &#39;horrifying&#39; manner.<br/><br/>The actors did a stellar job. The film was shot brilliantly. Critics heaped praises onto the film, the audience - mixed reviews, majority positive; and all the positive ones were extra positive. I suppose I am in the minority and didn&#39;t enjoy the film as much, perhaps the ending the fly for me but if you&#39;re in the mood for a horror movie, you might wanna give this a shot and see if you like it.

      "plot_summary": "At his grandmother Ellen Taper Leigh’s funeral, 78-year-old Ellen’s daughter Annie Graham delivers the eulogy while Annie’s husband Steve wakes their teenage son Peter and 13-year-old daughter Charlie. Charlie makes a strange clucking noise and draws a repeated symbol. That night Annie finds a memory book and briefly sees Ellen’s face. At school a bird smashes into Charlie’s classroom window; Charlie beheads the bird. Charlie later asks Annie if Ellen always wanted Charlie to be a boy and says she wants Ellen. Annie attends a grief support group and learns members practice séance techniques; Joan, a group member, shows Annie how to conduct a household summoning using a personal item, an incantation, and the whole family present.\n\nPeter promises to take Charlie to a party but leaves her unsupervised; Charlie eats cake containing an allergen, suffers anaphylaxis and, while Peter drives her to the hospital at night, Charlie’s head is severed when her head snaps out the car window and hits a utility pole. The Grahams hold a funeral for Charlie. Annie spirals into guilt and sleepwalking; she confesses to Peter she once tried to induce a miscarriage and shows signs of dissociation. She constructs a miniature diorama of Charlie’s death.\n\nAnnie tries Joan’s séance method with Charlie’s sketchbook and personal items; the family briefly appears to contact Charlie, but Annie becomes possessed or appears to be by Charlie/Ellen and Peter witnesses terrifying phenomena in his room (a reflection that doesn’t match him, a light above the bed, and visions of Charlie’s head falling off). Annie tells Peter she is the only one who can stop the spirit. She discovers in Joan’s apartment evidence linking Ellen and Joan to a coven devoted to the demon Paimon and to rituals that intended to host Paimon in a male human body; photographs show a triangular seal and images of Peter’s face inside ceremonial diagrams.\n\nAnnie finds Ellen’s decapitated corpse in the attic. She confronts Steve and demands he burn Charlie’s sketchbook to save Peter; when Steve refuses, Annie throws the book into the fire and Steve spontaneously combusts. Annie, now fully possessed, stalks Peter through the house. She hovers and then severs her own head. Peter flees to the attic, finds candles, flies, and a picture of his face with the eyes gouged out; Ellen’s body is missing. Peter jumps out of the tree house window to escape; his head strikes the ground and he appears briefly stunned.\n\nPeter awakens disoriented in the tree house where a naked, mostly disrobed coven waits. Charlie’s severed head is mounted on a statue of Paimon; Joan and other coven members crown Peter and call him by Charlie’s name, welcoming Paimon into a male vessel. The film ends on one of Annie’s miniature dioramas: a model tree house populated by dolls representing Peter (now Paimon’s host), the coven, and the headless corpses of Annie and Ellen.",

      "the story begins with the viewer looking out from a window in a workshop to a tree house, then turning and zooming in to a bedroom in a dollhouse that is in the workshop. steve graham wakes his teenage son peter and 13-year-old daughter charlie for their 78-year-old grandmother ellen taper leigh's funeral. steve finds charlie sleeping in the tree house. steve's wife annie, an artist who sculpts miniature dioramas, delivers the eulogy at her mother's service. charlie makes a clucking noise while drawing a strange sketch during the speech. annie talks to charlie about ellen at bedtime that night. charlie claims that her grandmother always wished charlie were a boy. to annie's confusion, charlie also wonders aloud who will care for her now that ellen is dead. annie later sees a haunting vision of ellen after looking through a memory book while in annie's workshop. a bird dies by flying into one of charlie's classroom windows at school. charlie goes outside and cuts off the bird's head. a woman across the street waves at charlie. annie begins researching apparitions. steve receives word from the cemetery that ellen's grave was desecrated, but he decides to not tell his wife. annie tells steve she is going to a movie, but actually attends a grief counseling support group. when she arrives at the meeting it is dark outside. annie openly discloses her mother's mental health issues including the dissociative identity disorder and dementia. charlie sees a strange light in her bedroom. gallery owner silvia archer contacts annie about progress on her new works, which include a piece featuring ellen. peter asks his mother if he can go to a party where he hopes to see bridget, a classmate he is interested in. annie asks peter if he invited his sister to go with him, since he claimed it was a party related to their school. charlie experiences a vision of her grandmother surrounded by fire. charlie makes her clucking noise when she is shaken out of her trance. charlie tells annie that she wants ellen. annie forces peter to take charlie with him to the party. flustered at having to monitor his sister, peter blows off charlie so he can smoke marijuana with bridget and their friends. many of women at the party are wearing long flannel-style shirts. left unsupervised, charlie unknowingly eats chocolate cake containing a substance to which she is allergic. charlie begins choking as she experiences an anaphylactic reaction. peter carries his sister to his car and rushes her toward the hospital along a dark country road. charlie sticks her head out the window in an effort to breathe better. peter swerves to avoid an animal in the road. charlie is decapitated when her head violently hits a utility pole. after sitting and staring in entranced shock, peter drives home in a calm daze. annie comes outside when it is light outside and is horrified to find her daughter's headless body in the car's backseat. the family holds a funeral for charlie. steve looks through charlie's sketchbook of drawings. peter experiences a panic attack while smoking marijuana, before biking home from school. peter arrives at home in the dark. annie grieves alone while sitting in the car in the driveway. annie drives to her grief support group meeting, but decides to turn around while still in the parking lot. it is dark when she arrives. however, before annie can leave, fellow group member joan spots annie and stops her to talk. after hearing about charlie's death, joan confides in annie about the loss of her own child and grandson. when annie returns home, steve makes a pass at her, but annie rebuffs him. annie sleeps in the tree house. peter hears charlie's clucking noise and sees what he thinks is a vision of his dead sister in his room, but it appears to be his own hoodie in the corner. annie visits joan at joan's apartment. annie tells joan about a sleepwalking incident in which she doused peter and charlie and herself from head to toe in paint thinner before waking up to find herself preparing to light a match. from her body language, annie implies that the matches were in her left hand and can of paint thinner in her right. annie explains that her relationships with her children were never the same afterward. steve finds annie constructing a disturbing diorama of the scene where charlie died. steve, annie, and peter have an awkward dinner during which annie blames her son for charlie's death. peter responds by reminding annie that she was the one who forced charlie to go to the party. annie runs into joan at an art supply store. joan excitedly explains to annie that she attended an open séance that changed her skepticism about psychics. joan tells annie that a medium was able to conjure her dead grandson louis and taught joan how to conduct a séance as well.\njoan has a chalkboard in the trunk of her car. joan invites annie over to witness a séance firsthand. joan seemingly makes contact with louis, who uses a glass and a chalkboard to communicate. joan assures annie that she can conduct a similar conjuring herself by using a personal item from the deceased, reciting a cryptic incantation, and making sure that her entire family is in the house during the summoning. annie hears a clucking sound while driving home afterward. annie wakes that night to find a swarm of ants leading to peter's dead body. annie wakes from a sleepwalking trance over her son's bed, prompting a conversation with peter. peter asks why annie is seemingly scared of him. annie involuntarily confesses that she never wanted to be peter's mother and tried to have a miscarriage. annie suddenly wakes to discover she was experiencing a vision within a vision. annie recites joan's incantation with charlie's sketchbook while steve and peter sleep. claiming she summoned charlie, annie excitedly wakes her husband and son for another séance. charlie seemingly possesses annie. steve snaps annie out of her trance by dousing her with water as peter cries from confused fright. during school, peter sees the same strange light that charlie previously saw in her bedroom. peter notices that his reflection looks back at him with a different expression. steve admonishes annie for peter becoming convinced that a vengeful spirit is threatening him. annie trashes her studio in frustration when she accidentally breaks a tiny model chair, after another voicemail from her gallery pressures her about providing new pieces. charlie's spirit supernaturally draws in her old sketchbook. peter sees a vision of his dead sister in the corner, and her head falls off turning into a recreation ball on the floor, before being choked in his bed. peter accuses his mother of sleepwalking and attacking him again. annie advises peter not to tell steve what happened. annie goes on to explain that something supernatural is happening in the house and she is the only one who can stop it. the window above peter's bed has a mark that looks similar to the one in charlie's classroom when struck by the bird. realizing that the spirit she summoned is malevolent, annie throws charlie's sketchbook into the fireplace. annie's arm mirrors the burning book by also catching fire, forcing annie to rescue the book. annie returns to joan for help, but no one's there and she does not go inside joan's residence. the camera shows us joan's place is decked out in witchcraft paraphernalia, including a photo of peter inside a ceremonial triangle and a symbol annie recognizes from family photos. annie learns that the symbol is associated with the demon paimon, one of the kings of hell. annie also finds photos of joan with ellen, revealing that joan and annie's mother were in the same coven devoted to gaining riches by conjuring paimon into a male body. annie discovers ellen's headless corpse in her house's attic. peter hears joan shouting, \"i expel you\" at him from a distance at school behind a fence. during class, peter hears charlie's cluck. peter acts possessed and suddenly bashes his head into his desk, snapping out of his trance with cries of terror and pain. annie stands in the pouring rain below the tree house with ellen's scrapbook, and we see that peter's room behind her in the real house does not exist. steve brings peter home. annie approaches the car, and is dry with no sign of the downpour. annie tells steve that ellen's corpse is in their attic, but it is now decapitated. annie also shows steve the photographs where joan and ellen are wearing the seal of paimon. annie explains that their family became cursed when she tried contacting charlie. annie also explains the connection to charlie's sketchbook, adding that steve needs to destroy it in order to save peter. peter sleeps in his room in the background and is not awakened by the conversation. disbelieving her wild claims, steve accuses annie of digging up ellen's grave. when steve refuses to burn the sketchbook, annie throws it back into the fire, even though she presumes doing so will kill her. instead, steve spontaneously combusts. with his possessed mother hovering in the corner above his bed, peter gets up to search the house. when peter leaves his room the ladder to the attic is withdrawn missing. peter finds his father's charred corpse. possessed, annie chases peter to the attic. the ladder to the attic is now down. annie jumps up and furiously pounds her head on the attic door after peter climbs the ladder and retracts it into the upstairs ceiling. in the attic, peter finds flies, candles, and a photo of his face with the eyes punched out. ellen's body is gone. annie suddenly hovers above peter before severing her own head. confronted by this horror and three undressed devil worshipers, peter jumps out the window. peter's head hits the ground below, which seemingly knocks him out. peter rises after the oddly glowing light seen previously hovers around his body. peter follows his mother's headless corpse as it floats into the tree house. an assembly of mostly devil worshipers in various states of undress greets peter inside the tree house. there is one woman with long hair in a bathrobe. charlie's decapitated head sits atop a statue of paimon. peter looks around with a dazed, flat expression and we're shown annie and ellen's headless bodies lie bowing on the floor, in front of the statue. joan's voice calls peter 'charlie' as a woman crowns him, but welcomes peter as paimon while the coven hails the demon's arrival. the story ends with a shot of a model tree house filled with dolls that look like peter, the coven, and the headless annie and ellen."

The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense &quot;writing&quot;... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller.

        "summary": "Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.",
        "text": "Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance&#39;s mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil&#39;s new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.<br/><br/>And it is within this film&#39;s subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy&#39;s big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind&#39;s fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick&#39;s purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could&#39;ve been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man&#39;s mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

It&#39;s dark, it&#39;s bleak, it&#39;s terrifying, a masterpiece in storytelling. You watch as the central character&#39;s mental collapse is played out in a spine chilling fashion.<br/><br/>Gorgeous camera work, incredible visuals, that opening is iconic. So many incredible, visual moments, the twins, lift, barman etc, no wonder it&#39;s been parodied multiple times over the years, famously by The Simpsons.<br/><br/>An iconic role for Jack Nicholson, he is incredible, well supported by a terrific cast.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a classic, 10/10."

        "text": "When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing &quot;The Shining&quot; was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I&#39;ve ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And &quot;funny&quot; because of Jack Nicholson&#39;s outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul"

        "text": "The Shining, you know what&#39;s weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick&#39;s classic vision of Stephen King&#39;s horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack&#39;s &quot;Here&#39;s Johnny!&quot;? Who could forget &quot;All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy&quot;? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick&#39;s best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it&#39;s 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. <br/><br/>Jack Torrance, Jack&#39;s son Danny, and Jack&#39;s wife, Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication &quot;shining.&quot; Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain &quot;shine&quot; to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny&#39;s curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel&#39;s Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word &quot;redrum&quot; frantically, and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own &quot;imaginary friend.&quot; Jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny&#39;s telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating &quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; formatted in various ways. Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written &quot;REDRUM&quot; in lipstick on the door of Wendy&#39;s bedroom. When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is &quot;Murder&quot; spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family&#39;s living quarters. &quot;Here&#39;s Johnny!&quot;, and Jack&#39;s legendary image is born.<br/><br/>The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson&#39;s performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack&#39;s rant All Work is incredible, that&#39;s a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it&#39;s honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it&#39;s a film of perfection, it&#39;s been on The Simpsons, it&#39;s been shown in other films and it&#39;s a film that will forever stay with you when you see it, trust me.<br/><br/>10/10"

        "text": "Whenever we hear the name Stanley Kubrick, the poster, scene or a shot from The Shining will come to our mind - most probably &quot; Here&#39;s Johnny!&quot;. For a legendary filmmaker like Kubrick who has multiple masterpieces to his credit, would still be fine if he had never even made this film. But still, there would be some great missing which will be felt! That&#39;s because of The Shining&#39;s ability to penetrate the viewer&#39;s mind, even the subconscious, and imprint an influence in its deeper depths. How the movie hooks the viewer with its horror which is created from several dimensions is a remarkable factor that makes this film an all-perfect masterpiece that is thrilling and exciting even after watching it umpteen times.<br/><br/>How Kubrick created the horror, just one among the many factors that make the film a great one (still a very important one though), is so deep and mind-blowing, he builds tension in the viewer with enough substance written in the screenplay to showcase on the screen, and perfectly well-tuned and tastefully directed horror. Most importantly, the background music and sounds have immense depth with its structuring crafted to the innermost core and the finely touched upper layers. The actors give performances that are dramatically aesthetic and showcase facial expressions that are realistic to the utmost extent. As the film progresses the anticipation for something scary to expect in the upcoming scenes is created successfully and the anticipation that it created is also executed by scaring the viewer with horrors of huge intensity.<br/><br/>One thing that is found in this film is something of a variety. It&#39;s the portrayal of the supernatural in a very realistic manner, which is done in a subtle way that doesn&#39;t let the viewer know that it&#39;s a realistic portrayal of the supernatural he won&#39;t even care to notice it. Because that&#39;s how successfully it&#39;s done. And what&#39;s the use of it? It has an impact on the viewer which affects how he perceives the film, and that too which will be something of an advantage for the filmmaker.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t intend to say anything about the story of the film, whether it&#39;s supernatural horror or the breakdown of a madman&#39;s mind, is still debated among cinephiles, even 40 years after the film&#39;s release. And that&#39;s also a thing which makes the film a great one! Rather than just showing what the maker wants to show, Kubrick lets the viewer decide what the film is, by making him analyse the film from his perspective and come up with an interpretation. This is a form of interactive cinema, an indirect one though.<br/><br/>The Shining is one of the greatest horror masterpieces or even one of the best films of all time."

This film is what all great films STRIVE to be. The highest of film standards.<br/><br/>The Shining is a masterwork of creating mood, setting tone, and developing an atmosphere. The score is one of the best and most iconic scores of all time. As well as the most eerie.<br/><br/>This is honestly my favorite of all Stanley Kubrick&#39;s films. The Shining is a masterpiece of cinema *chefs kiss*<br/><br/>The only thing that is a negative imo is that if your not completely invested in the movie and ready to sit down and watch, you will get bored. It&#39;s lengthy, but worth it once your totally engrossed in the film. Especially for your first viewing. You gotta pay attention."

        "summary": "Hypnotic Horror Masterpiece",
        "text": "An amazingly directed horror movie that stands out as easily one of the best of the genre thanks to its almost hypnotic directing, unsettling tone &amp; atmosphere, and isolating empty feeling of dread that never goes away throughout the entire film. Stephen King famously hated this adaptation since it reframed Jack Torrence as always internally evil, with the house merely bringing out his most repressed cruel habits when he&#39;s isolated and has no one stopping or distracting him from giving into his worst instincts. Stephen King originally wrote Jack as a much more sympathetic father figure that was merely misguided by the Sinister hotel. Probably since he apparently projected a lot of his own troubles with alcoholism &amp; mental anguish into the character and likely sees a small part of himself into the character. But from director Stanley Kubrick&#39;s outside perspective, anyone who breaks his child&#39;s arm over a &quot;drunken accident&quot; is despicable and shouldn&#39;t be given nearly as much good faith on the autonomy and scrutiny of his actions. Jack Nicholson &amp; Shelly Duvall both give such an unnerving performance with so many subtle lines, actions, and body language ticks that immediately make us understand that something is off and there is a clear power imbalance between the two, either stemming from abuse or its just holding back by mere threads. Jack rarely shouts, and yet he feels like a ticking time bomb ready to go off at any moment, while is wife feels like one of Freud&#39;s lab mice with little freedom to leave and just has to anxiously anticipate when the emotional bomb will go off (also the MVP for basically doing Jack&#39;s hotel jobs for him while he&#39;s just sitting on his ass moping about his failed writing career). The child performance was also great and shared a great friendship with the hotel cook. A nice sliver of warmth and hope in this otherwise cold movie. The horror imagery is unsettling, partly thanks to the movie restricting itself to only sparingly sprinkle these scenes in order to properly build up the terror that awaits the protagonists as Jack slowly loses his mind &amp; tears down any moral chains locked up by society. All breaking out in a terrifying climax as Jack breaks down and goes full axe-crazy in one of the most iconic horror assaults in cinematic history. It&#39;s certainly slow, but if you keep patient (at least longer than Jack), then you&#39;ll soon come to see why it&#39;s so brilliant and easily one of Stanley Kubrick&#39;s best works."

      "plot_summary": "Jack Torrance, a recovering alcoholic and former teacher, interviews with Overlook Hotel manager Stuart Ullman in Colorado and accepts the winter caretaker job to write and provide for his wife Wendy and son Danny. Ullman warns Jack about isolation and recounts a past caretaker, Charles Grady, who murdered his family and himself. Danny, who has a psychic ability called the \"shining,\" collapses on the way to the hotel and later meets head chef Dick Hallorann, who recognizes Danny's gift and warns him specifically to stay out of Room 237. The staff leaves as winter sets in and the Torrances are snowbound. Jack suffers writer's block, insomnia and increasing irritability. Danny experiences visions: an elevator spouting blood, the two murdered Grady girls, and other disturbing images. Danny repeatedly senses a presence tied to the hotel's rooms; at one point a ball rolls from Room 237 and Danny later appears bruised and disoriented after entering it. Jack begins seeing apparitions in the hotel — he encounters bartender Lloyd in the empty Gold Room and later a lavish 1920s party where Delbert Grady (the former caretaker) tells Jack that Danny must be \"corrected\" and instructs Jack how to handle Wendy. Jack's behavior grows erratic: he denies problems in Room 237 despite seeing a woman who transforms into a rotting corpse there, lashes out verbally at Wendy, and reverts toward violence. Wendy discovers Jack's manuscript is pages of the repeated line \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\" proving his mental collapse. When Wendy confronts him he attacks; she incapacitates and locks him in the pantry. Jack sabotages the radio and the snowcat to prevent escape. Danny, channeling his psychic trauma, writes \"REDRUM\" and speaks hypnotically; in a mirror the word reads \"MURDER.\" Jack breaks out and relentlessly pursues Wendy and Danny, chopping through doors with an axe and burning the hotel further into murderous frenzy. Dick Hallorann senses Danny's distress from Florida and flies to the Overlook; Jack murders Hallorann with an axe when Hallorann arrives. Danny hides in a cabinet, escapes to the outside and leads Jack into the hedge maze. Using foresight and care, Danny retraces his footprints to confuse Jack; Jack becomes lost, freezes to death in the snowbound maze. Wendy and Danny escape in the snowcat. The film closes on the hotel's historical photo wall: a 1921 photograph shows Jack among the hotel's past guests, implying Jack has become part of the Overlook's history and influence.",

      "former teacher and recovering alcoholic jack torrance ( jack nicholson ) interviews for a caretaker job at the overlook hotel in an effort to rebuild his life after his volatile temper lost him his teaching position. the hotel manager, mr. stuart ullman ( barry nelson ), warns jack that he and his family will be snowbound through most of the winter and of the potential risk for cabin fever. he drives the point home by recounting a season when the caretaker, charles grady, went crazy and brutaly killed his wife, his two girls ( lisa burns and louise burns ), and finally himself. given his own desperation and the opportunity to pursue his true passion, writing, jack acknowledges the warning, but accepts the job. meanwhile, jack's son danny ( danny lloyd ) has a seizure while talking to his imaginary friend tony about the overlook hotel. he has a vision of blood splashing out of an elevator in the hotel, an image which is revisited several times throughout the film. upon danny's arrival at the hotel, head chef dick hallorann ( scatman crothers ) recognizes that danny is telepathic, and speaks to him mentally to offer him some ice cream. he explains that he and his grandmother both had the gift; she referred to this communication as \"shining.\" he also counsels danny about the hotel, hinting that something terrible had happened there and left a trace, \"as if someone burned toast,\" which only people who can \"shine\" will perceive. danny questions dick about what went on in the hotel, and about room 237 in particular as danny can sense that dick is especially afraid of that room. though he strives to assure danny that the images he sees in the hotel are just 'like pictures in a book' and can't hurt him, dick sternly warns danny to stay out of that room. jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly once the family is alone in the hotel. he has writer's block, sleeps too little, and is irritable. danny has visions of the two murdered grady girls, but tells no one. he continues to wonder about room 237. while the weather is still relatively warm, jack's wife wendy ( shelley duvall ) and danny walk through a maze of tall hedges, making a game out of it, stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes. jack looks through a maze model sculpture inside the room of the maze hedge and can see wendy and danny inside the maze. one day, a ball rolls toward danny as he plays with his toys. it appears to have come from the open door of room 237, which danny enters. at that moment, wendy comes running from the basement at the sound of jack's screams in the lounge. he tells her that he had a nightmare in which he used an axe to chop danny and her to pieces. as a disconcerted wendy promises that 'everything's gonna be okay,' danny appears at the other end of the room, looking disoriented and sucking his thumb. his sweater is ripped and there are bruises on his neck. he does not answer when wendy asks what happened. she angrily accuses jack of hurting danny and takes the child back to their suite. jack is furious about the accusation. he storms around the hotel, making his way to the gold ballroom. sinking defeatedly onto a stool at an empty bar, his head in his hands, jack declares that he would sell his soul for one drink. when he looks up he discovers a bartender ( joe turkel ), who serves him a drink. jack is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of the bartender and even addresses him by his name, lloyd. in the course of telling his troubles to lloyd, jack reveals that he unintentionally dislocated danny's shoulder, the same accident wendy mentioned to danny's pediatrician earlier. notably, jack states that the injury happened three years ago, while in explaining the same story to the pediatrician, wendy said that jack, who vowed to quit drinking immediately following the accident, has currently been sober for only five months. a frantic wendy enters, finding jack seemingly alone at the bar; she pleads with him to investigate danny's claim that \"a crazy woman\" attacked him in the bathtub of room 237. jack, who acts a bit tipsy, grudgingly agrees to go have a look. as jack approaches the door to room 237, danny appears to be having a seizure in his own room. dick, back at his home in florida, stares wide-eyed as he picks up on a signal danny is sending. jack cautiously enters room 237. the bedroom is empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. he watches lustfully as a young, beautiful, naked woman ( lia beldam ) pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly out of the bathtub. the two approach each other and embrace in a passionate kiss. jack catches a glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse. he recoils in horror-- the young lady standing before him has transformed into an elderly woman ( billie gibson ); a walking corpse with rotten, sagging skin. she cackles madly while reaching for him with outstretched arms. stunned, jack staggers out of the room, locking the door after him. when he reports back to wendy, jack denies anything amiss in room 237. wendy suggests they take danny to a doctor. jack becomes irate, lecturing wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming her for everything that's gone wrong in his life. insisting that they can't leave the hotel because of his obligation to his employers, he storms out, returning to the gold room, which is now the scene of an extravagant party with guests dressed in 1920's fashion. lloyd serves him a drink and jack strolls through the crowd. he doesn't get far when a butler carrying a tray runs into him, spilling advocaat on his jacket. the butler convinces jack to come into the bathroom to clean up. the butler introduces himself as delbert grady ( philip stone ). jack remembers the story mr. ullman told him about a former caretaker named grady murdering his family and confronts grady with the information. grady denies that anything of the sort took place and furthermore insists that jack has 'always been the caretaker.' jack is confused, but seems to accept grady's story. grady goes on to tell jack that danny has 'a great talent' and is using it to bring an 'outside party' into the situation, referring to dick halloran with a racial slur. grady advises jack on how to \"correct\" danny, and how to deal with wendy if she interferes. back in florida, dick has had no luck contacting the people at the overlook hotel. worried about danny, he books the next flight to colorado. at the overlook, wendy arms herself with a baseball bat and looks for jack, intent on leaving the hotel with danny whether or not jack agrees to come. entering the lounge, she spots jack's manuscript left unattended next to the typewriter. she reads what jack has been writing: hundreds of pages of repetitions of a single sentence: 'all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.' she realizes that jack has gone mad. jack approaches from behind and asks her sarcastically, how she likes it. wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face him. a confrontation ensues as jack demands to know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel with danny, while wendy retreats, brandishing the bat. she screams at jack not to hurt her, and he swears that he will not; instead, he intends to kill her. wendy hits jack on the head with the bat at the top of a flight of stairs, causing him to lose his balance and tumble down the staircase, injuring his ankle in the process. wendy drags jack's limp body to the pantry and locks him inside, just as he regains consciousness. jack tells her he has sabotaged the radio, as well as the snow cat, stranding them all there. she goes outside to check on the snow cat, and confirms what he told her. a few hours later, jack is roused from a nap by the sound of delbert grady's voice. grady expresses disappointment and a lack of confidence in jack, but jack assures him he can get the job done if given one more chance. the pantry door then suddenly unlocks. wendy has fallen asleep in her room. danny is in a trance, carrying a knife and muttering 'redrum' repeatedly. he takes wendy's lipstick and writes 'redrum' on the bathroom door. he begins shouting 'redrum,' which wakes wendy. she clutches him to her, then sees the reflection of the bathroom door in the mirror. reversed, it reads: 'murder.' at that instant, banging sounds start coming from the door to the hallway. the sound is jack swinging an axe at the locked door. wendy grabs danny and locks them in the bathroom. she opens a tiny, snow banked window and pushes danny out; he slides safely to the ground. she tries to get out the same window, but cannot fit. she tells danny to run and hide. meanwhile, jack has chopped his way through the front door and calls out that he is home. jack then knocks politely on the bathroom door. wendy holds the knife and tries to steady herself as jack begins chopping into the door. after chopping away one of the panels, he sticks his head through. jack sticks his hand through the door to turn the lock. wendy slashes at him with a knife, cutting jack's hand and sending him recoiling in pain. jack continues to hack at the door with the axe until they both hear the low rumble of an approaching snow cat engine. he stalks out. the snow cat driver is dick. inside the hotel, he calls out, but gets no reply. jack, hiding behind a pillar, leaps out and swings the axe into dick's chest, killing him. danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet, screams, revealing his location. he clambers out of the steel cabinet and runs outside. meanwhile, wendy has ventured from the bathroom and begun to search for danny. the hotel has sprung to life and now even wendy encounters its ghosts, sights that shock and horrify her. at the same time, axe-wielding jack turns on the outdoor lights and follows danny into the hedge maze. danny realizes he is leaving a trail of footprints in the snow for jack to follow. he carefully retraces his steps, walking backwards in the same prints he'd just created in the opposite direction, then covers the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge. when jack arrives, he sees that the trail of footprints ends abruptly, giving him no clue as to which direction danny took. he chooses a path and lurches deeper into the maze. danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows his own footprints back to the maze's entrance. wendy makes her way out of the hotel just as danny emerges from the maze. relieved, she flings down the knife and embraces him. jack bellows his frustration from within the maze. danny and wendy waste no time escaping in the snow cat that dick used to get to the hotel. jack, hopelessly lost in the maze, freezes to death. right before the end credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old photographs that chronicle the hotel's history. an old recording of 'midnight, the stars and you' echoes in the empty hallway. in the center of one picture is a young jack. the caption reads, 'overlook hotel, july 4th ball, 1921.'"

      "after landing a job as an off-season caretaker, jack torrance, an aspiring author and recovering alcoholic, drags his wife wendy and gifted son danny to snow-covered colorado's secluded overlook hotel. however, writer's block prevents jack from pursuing a new writing career. everything has its time, however. first, the manager must give jack a grand tour. then, mr hallorann, the facility's aging chef, chats with danny about rare psychic gifts. the mysterious employee also warns the boy about the cavernous hotel's abandoned rooms. room 237, especially, is off-limits. that's all very well, but jack is gradually losing his mind. after all, strange occurrences and blood-chilling visions have trapped the family in a silent gargantuan prison hammered by endless snowstorms. and now, incessant voices inside jack's head demand sacrifice. however, is jack capable of murder?",
      "built in 1907, the posh, grand and secluded overlook hotel, located in the mountains of colorado, closes for the winter months as it was never designed as a ski resort, that seclusion and isolation which has always been its attraction for its upscale guests and which makes it largely inaccessible in the snowy winter. having recently moved from vermont to boulder with his wife wendy and their adolescent son danny, former schoolteacher jack torrance has just accepted the five month job as the overlook's winter caretaker in wanting uninterrupted solitude to start his new career as a writer. in accepting the job, jack was not deterred in knowing of the incident ten years ago when the then hotel gm charles grady, acting as that season's winter caretaker, developed a severe case of cabin fever and ended up gruesomely killing his wife and two daughters before killing himself. beyond a recent undiagnosed collapse experienced by danny which may be an issue if it happens again at the hotel, wendy is looking forward to this five month getaway. while danny indirectly states he doesn't want to go, wendy is not concerned about his emotional well being in this new situation as he, out of circumstance, has often been on his own without other children around, which has long ago led to him creating an imaginary friend named tony who lives in danny's mouth. when the torrances arrive at the overlook on october 30th, its last day of operation before they take over for the winter, danny learns that there is someone at the hotel who knows his secret abilities in association to tony's true nature. after the regular staff leaves for the winter and as winter truly sets in, the isolation of the resort begins to show itself. the question becomes which of the often battling powers in this isolation will ultimately come out on top: wendy's mortal fortitude, danny's secret ability which he learns is called the shining, or the hotel's associated secrets which are slowly overtaking jack.",
      "the wannabe writer jack torrance travels to the overlook hotel to be interviewed by the manager stuart ullman about a job position. jack is a candidate to work as caretaker of the hotel over the winter, and ullman warns him about the cabin fever since his family will be isolated for five months. ten years ago, the caretaker charles grady murdered his wife, his two daughters and himself with an ax affected by the isolation. on the day the hotel is closed, jack arrives with his wife wendy torrance and son danny and while ullman shows the hotel to jack and wendy, the chief of the kitchen dick hallorann entertains danny. he explains to danny that they are shining, meaning they have premonition and telepathic abilities. during the winter, danny sees weird events at the hotel and jack works hard on his novel. until the day danny is wounded by a woman in room 237 that tries to strangle him and wendy discovers that jack is insane.",
      "jack torrance becomes caretaker of the isolated overlook hotel during winter, bringing his family. the hotel's supernatural forces exploit jack's mental instability, leading to violence and terror. son danny possesses psychic \"shining\" abilities, sensing the hotel's malevolence. the film blends horror, psychological drama, and suspense, exploring isolation, madness, family dynamics, and the destructive potential of unaddressed trauma."

Its not entirely made up of &quot;make you jump&quot; scenes, which it does have, but scenes with genuine horror. <br/><br/>Insidious has taken a risk with doing something original, and It works here for them. Without giving anything away the movie does not just talk about whats scary, or show the the aftermath of something going on in a room that you can only hear until its over and the door magically unlocks. Insidious shows you whats scary, and quite often reminds you whats there, and waiting in the dark."

        "text": "Of all the genre&#39;s that Hollywood has to offer, the most tattered of the bunch is without a doubt the horror department. I am so sick of these wannabe &#39;so called&#39; horror flicks that belong on late night lifetime channel. Im sick of the same old parlor tricks and scare tactics that have been used for the past 10 years. And i am even more sickened by the fact that they keep making the same crap year after year. You would figure after great horror flicks like &quot;The Decent&quot; and &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot;, studios would start realizing what actually works and what audiences want to see. Hopefully in the coming years, this genre&#39; will come back to life.<br/><br/>When it comes to horror movies, i think the two most crucial elements are the cinematography, and the musical score. Actually, i prefer there to be no music at all. Almost all the great horror movies never use it, because they rely on scaring the audience with disturbing images, not raised music that makes everyone jump. If i want that, I&#39;ll go to a haunted house. When i go to see a horror flick, i want it to leave a lasting impression. However, movies like this are the one exception.<br/><br/>This film had such amazing cinematography, that i didn&#39;t even care about those &#39;raised music&#39; sequences. I rarely get creeped out at the theater, and this movie scared the crap out of me. I&#39;m talking&#39; sweaty palms, eyes wide open, my body sunk all the way down in my chair scared. And for those of you who have read my reviews in the past, i hardly ever say that about a horror flick. And what really sold it was the cinematography. This film is packed with tons of really creepy and disturbing images. So much in fact, that you will hate walking into your dark house alone. Yes, they do use the same scare tactics, but since everything in the movie looked so damn creepy and demented, i for once didn&#39;t want the lead female to hurry up and open the basement door and get it over with.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty decent. It&#39;s not an amazing concept or genuinely creepy on it&#39;s own. But it does a decent enough of a job to keep your interest and sell what your seeing unfold on screen. And it&#39;s safe to say that this is a very different take on your typical haunted house.<br/><br/>Bottom Line......holy crap, i just realized that this movie is only PG-13. Is it possible for a movie to be scary as hell and only be rated PG-13? The answer is yes, and this is a prime example of that. You know when a horror movie has done it&#39;s job? It&#39;s when it scares you both in the theater, and hours later when you try to sleep at night. Tonight, i will have lots of trouble sleeping. I can easily say that this will probably be the best horror movie of the year."

I went into it expecting some scares but nothing too bad. Wrong. This movie scared me out of my wits. I don&#39;t think I have ever jumped more during any other scary movie. The audience was spooked too. I saw many other people jumping out of their seats and even heard a few actual screams.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you, not gross you out. The images are frightening for sure. Insidious doesn&#39;t waste any time trying to creep you out. The scares already start with the opening credits. I sure was not expecting this to be one of the scariest movies i&#39;ve seen but it lives up to that. That being said, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have the guts to see it again!"

I watched many scary movies and Insidious is the one that really made it sound and seems so real that it allows audience relate to it. I was expecting to see some people died in horrible way where their guts and bloods are everywhere and floor splashed with red tomato juices. You&#39;ll never have to see that kind of scene in here, they keep it as close as possible for you to relate in your real life and in your room while you are struggling to sleep."

        "text": "James Wan, best known as one of the initial creators of the &#39;Saw&#39; series, returns to the duo with &#39;Saw&#39; co-creator Leigh Whannel (who also stars) with a new ghost story starring Patrick Wilson (&#39;Watchmen&#39;) and Rose Byrne (&#39;Get Him to the Greek&#39;).<br/><br/>Josh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) think they have it all: a beautiful new home, three lovely children. . . and a gang of unruly ghosts causing torment around them. Unfortunately, after Dalton, one of their sons, is knocked unconscious and falls into a coma, things take a supernatural turn for the worst. To save Dalton, Josh and Renai call on a ghost-hunting team (Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson) and a psychic (Lin Shaye) to investigate the paranormal presence within the house and put a stop to it before their son&#39;s soul is lost to &quot;the further.&quot;<br/><br/>Due to recent trends within the horror genre, haunted house flicks have been rather few &amp; far between. However, a few recent solid entries have been more than worthwhile, including &#39;El Orfanato&#39; and the &#39;Paranormal Activity&#39; films. James Wan, thankfully, adds this quality haunt film to the short list of recent successes. His film, however, does something different than other ghost stories: It&#39;s funny. While it doesn&#39;t go as over-the-top with its humour as a film like &#39;Drag Me to Hell,&#39; it does blend enough laughs throughout to greatly enhance the entertainment value of the overall film, making it feel like a classic-style dark house flick. If only Vincent Price could&#39;ve been around to perfect that feeling. <br/><br/>Technically, the film is quite impressive, especially for the reported $1 million budget, which is unsurprising after what Wan &amp; Whannell did with the $1.2 million they had for the original &#39;Saw.&#39; The highest levels of the film come from those elements that don&#39;t need a massive budget: the direction, cinematography, and writing. These really were what set the film above what, by anyone else, would have been a straight-to-video-quality forgotten film. Another solid element that makes the film a step above most at its level comes from the cast, especially the work by genre veterans Barbara Hershey (&#39;The Entity&#39;) and Lin Shaye (&#39;Dead End&#39;). Their acting added a much-appreciated level of depth to the fun of the film. <br/><br/>Of all the many positive aspects of &#39;Insidious,&#39; however, perhaps the most attractive is the simplest: It&#39;s actually pretty damn scary. While it doesn&#39;t contain the slow-burn creeps and chills of &#39;Paranormal Activity&#39; and the like, it does contain some of the most well executed and well timed scares in a long time. Though the quantity of scares tapers off throughout the final act of the film, the first two-thirds of the film contain more than enough to satisfy any fan of the haunted house subgenre.<br/><br/>Overall, &#39;Insidious&#39; manages to be, as expected by Wan&#39;s previous work, an entertaining &amp; original ride. It has enough humour &amp; horror to satisfy any film-goer without focusing too heavily on one angle to make the other side feel awkward. One hope: Do not let the PG-13 rating shy you away. It actually contains more content worthy of an R-rating than &#39;Paranormal Activity&#39; did.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 7.5/10. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>-AP3-"

        "text": "I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy, campy romp with the same &quot;tried and true tricks of the trade,&quot; like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame, but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it&#39;s one of the scariest movies I&#39;ve ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn&#39;t make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. <br/><br/>I was also expecting to see some blood and guts, especially coming from the guys who made Saw, but there wasn&#39;t a drop. Instead, they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater (my girlfriend included). From literally the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn&#39;t leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension, making even the characters&#39; mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I&#39;d say it&#39;s the most calories I&#39;ve ever burned while watching a movie (well, at least a PG-13 movie). <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great. It was crazy scary, thoroughly entertaining, and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that, it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie; I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it&#39;s probably best to go with someone who&#39;s already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well."

Then, after moving into a new house, one of their kids Dalton (Ty Simkins) falls into a coma...for no reason at all. They take care of him at home but then scary things happen. Rose starts hearing noises and seeing strange people around the house. They figure the house is haunted and has affected their son. They move to a new house and quickly realize it&#39;s NOT the house that is haunted.<br/><br/>Pretty good evil spirit story. I avoided this like the plague when it came out because of the PG-13 rating. ALL the PG-13 horror films I&#39;ve seen (except for &quot;The Ring&quot;) have been boring and stupid. This was praised by critics so I decided to give it a try on DVD. It was much better than other PG-13 horror films. It IS well made and acted and there were some very scary moments...but it&#39;s far from perfect. For one thing after it&#39;s established the couple has three kids the other two seem to disappear completely when they move to a new house. Also it has those incredibly annoying jump scare moments. What&#39;s even MORE annoying is the writer and director said they tried to avoid using them! There&#39;s also at least three fairly long sequences with people wandering around in dark houses and places...and these scenes are deadly boring and bring the movie to a screeching halt. And I HATED the terrible &quot;it&#39;s not over&quot; ending. Still it did scare me and the acting is good across the board especially by Lin Shaye. It&#39;s also nice to see Barbara Hershey in a small role. So--I give it a marginal recommendation."

        "text": "INSIDIOUS is yet another one of those Hollywood ghost stories involving a possessed child. It follows a predictable format, with minor, isolated incidents gradually giving way to larger-scale, more pronounced apparitions and events before culminating in a full-scale onslaught of evil. And it&#39;s all rather silly.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first half of the movie. It&#39;s here where things are kept subtle and straightforward, with effectively creepy scare scenes and half-glimpsed figures spotted lurking in darkened rooms. So far, so good. But around the halfway mark, the film introduces a trio of paranormal investigators and things quickly descent into POLTERGEIST-style farce.<br/><br/>The problem with depictions of a hellish limbo or netherworld is that, in order to make something scary, you have to pretty much identify with the different fears of each viewer. Sorry, but I don&#39;t find tussles with greasy-looking hobos and Darth Maul from THE PHANTOM MENACE to be particularly frightening; in fact, there&#39;s something pantomime about the whole thing.<br/><br/>The actors, including the dependable Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson, do their best but at times in the latter stages they seem to struggle to keep a straight face while the ludicrous events increase in scale and speed. It&#39;s a shame that the whole thing goes to pot, because if it had been handled more sensitively (and with less sensationalism) by the team behind the SAW franchise then it could well have worked much better."

James Wan did a very impressive for only an $800,000 budget for this movie. If you&#39;re going in the theatre expecting to see the typical, run of the mill, haunted house flick you will be sadly mistaken and surprisingly pleased at the same time. <br/><br/>The parts that I liked most about the film is the detailing. Everything in the movie means something no matter how small and I love that when the suspense builds up for the audience to be scared, you won&#39;t be disappointed to find its just the dog or the tree brushing against the window....it will definitely be something to be scared of. The people sitting beside me kept laughing at me because whenever the suspense would build I would say to myself &quot;uh uh....uh uh&quot;.<br/><br/>But enough of my rambling, the plot was definitely original and James Wan and Leigh Schanell definitely succeeded in bringing the audience something scary, suspenseful, funny, emotional, and frightening all at the same time. The score is amazing. The use of all sound design was great specially since they weren&#39;t any fake screams. LOL. The best acting performance, hands down, was Lin Shaye. She did an amazing job with her role. I can&#39;t say anymore without spoiling the movie. All I can say is, if you LOVE a good scary movie then you must see this movie."

One night Dalton climbs into the attic, falls from a ladder and thereafter sleeps in an unresponsive, inexplicable coma. Three months later Dalton is returned home; soon strange phenomena escalate: whispering on the baby monitor (“I want it now!”), a bloody handprint on Dalton’s bed, a frightening man seen in the baby’s room, and Foster saying Dalton “walks around” at night. After Renai is assaulted by the strange man, the family moves, but the hauntings follow and intensify—Lorraine (Josh’s mother) dreams of a presence in Dalton’s room and later sees a red-faced figure behind Josh. Lorraine contacts paranormal investigator Elise Rainier. Elise and her two assistants visit Dalton’s room; Elise identifies a black figure with a red face and hollow eyes and explains Dalton’s ability to astral-projection: while his body sleeps his consciousness travels, and this time Dalton has wandered too far into “The Further,” a realm of lost souls. Tormented spirits and a malicious red-faced demon now seek to possess Dalton’s body. Josh reluctantly accepts Elise’s claim after discovering Dalton’s drawings match Elise’s description. During a séance Dalton’s spirit briefly appears but the demon uses Dalton’s body to lash out, and multiple entities assault the group. Elise reveals to Josh that he, too, can astral-project and was terrorized as a child; family photos show a shadowy old woman looming closer behind young Josh. Elise prepares Josh to enter the Further to find Dalton. In astral form Josh sees his sleeping body and the team in the physical world, then travels through a misty, desolate landscape. He follows clues—a boy who points him toward a house (the Lamperts’ original home), a living-room scene where a smiling female member of a spectral family shoots a family—then reaches the attic and a red lacquered door. He defeats the violent man apparition and enters the door into the Further. Inside a cavernous red chamber Josh finds Dalton chained and sobbing; he frees him but the red-faced demon attacks. Josh and Dalton flee toward their bodies while the demon pursues. Josh briefly confronts the shadowy old woman inside the House and screams that he isn’t afraid; she retreats. Josh and Dalton awaken in their bodies; the spirits vanish. The family appears reunited and Elise prepares to leave with Josh. When Elise takes Josh’s childhood photos, she snaps a photo of Josh; he suddenly becomes violent, assaults and strangles Elise to death, then disappears. Renai finds Elise’s camera and discovers a picture of the shadowy old woman; Elise’s last observation—Josh’s old, dirt-stained hand—implies the woman has possessed Josh. The film ends with Josh, now possessed, placing his hand on Renai’s shoulder saying “Renai, I’m right here,” while the shadowy-old-woman presence is shown blowing out a candle in a post-credits shot.",

      "at the beginning of the film, a shadowy old woman is seen inside a house while the inhabitants sleep.\nrenai and josh lambert have recently moved into a new home with their three children. one morning, renai looks through a family photo album with her son, dalton, who asks why there are no pictures of josh when he was a child. renai reasons that he has always been camera shy and disliked taking photos of himself. one evening, dalton sees the attic door open and goes to investigate after hearing sounds upstairs. as he enters inside, he tries to climb a ladder to turn on the light, but falls when the ladder cracks. as he falls to the floor, he seems to stare in horror at the darkness as if looking at something terrifying. shaken, he is put to bed by renai and josh and told not to play in the attic because it is off-limits. the next day, dalton does not awaken from his sleep. renai and josh rush him to the hospital, where the doctors say he is in an inexplicable coma. three months later, dalton is moved back to his home while still in a coma. shortly after, disturbing events begin to occur. the first is when renai hears a voice on the baby monitor which shouts \"i want it now!\", a bloody hand-print on dalton's bed and a strange but frightening man in her infant daughter's bedroom. renai becomes more disturbed when their youngest son, foster, says he does not like it when dalton \"walks around\" at night. renai tells josh about the events, but when she is assaulted by the strange man that night, she begs josh and the family soon moves to another house. in the new house, the supernatural events continue to occur, such as a strange, dancing boy, and soon become increasingly sinister. lorraine, josh's mother, recalls having a strange dream of going inside dalton's room in the night and seeing something standing in the corner, and when questioned \"what do you want?\", it replies \"dalton.\" subsequently lorraine sees a red-faced figure standing behind josh that roars at her and dalton is then violently attacked in his bedroom. this prompts lorraine to contact a friend, elise reiner, who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity. the family, elise, and her team enter dalton's room and elise sees and describes a figure to one of her two assistants, who draws a black figure with a red face and dark hollow eyes on the ceiling of dalton's room; the same figure that lorraine had seen before in the house. elise explains to renai and josh that dalton has the ability to astral project while sleeping and that he has been doing it since he was very young. the reason that dalton is in a comatose state is because he has fearlessly traveled too far into different spiritual worlds (he believes the projections are dreams) and has consequently become lost in a land called \"the further\", a place for the tormented souls of the dead. while dalton's spirit is in this other world, he has left nothing but a lifeless body. the tormented souls crave another chance at life through dalton's state, while there are others (possibly the old woman and the frightening man) who are more malicious in using him, and then there is the red-faced figure, revealed to be a demon, who wants to use dalton for a more malicious intent. however, for a spirit to consume a body, a period of time and energy are required. skeptical at first, josh later relents when he discovers dalton had been drawing pictures which resemble the demonic figure elise described. they run a session to try to communicate with their son but dalton appears and the demon uses dalton's body to fight the group, along with other entities who want dalton's body. after the session, elise calls lorraine and the two reveal to the couple that josh also can astral project and was terrorized by an evil spirit during his childhood. lorraine shows them pictures from josh's childhood, revealing a shadowy old woman (the same woman from the beginning of the film) behind him. the more photographs taken of josh, the closer the shadowy woman begins to get to josh until she is inches away from him, explaining his fear of photos. elise suggests that josh should use his ability to find and help return dalton's soul, to which josh agrees. to prepare to astral-project and find his son, elise sits him in a chair and places him in a trance. josh suddenly awakes to find that he has astral-projected seeing his own self asleep in the chair as well as the others in the room. he proceeds outside in a misty emptiness in an attempt to find his way to dalton. after encountering a boy who points him back towards a house (the same home that the lamberts moved out of), he proceeds, only to encounter a family who is shot by a bizarre, smiling female member of the family in the living room. startled, josh makes his way to the attic where he discovers a red door (the same one drawn in dalton's pictures). before he can enter, the violent man seen by renai in their daughter's room appears and attacks him. once defeating him, josh enters the red door. inside is \"the further\" and the red-faced demon's lair. while entering a cavernous red room, josh discovers a sobbing dalton, chained to the floor. josh frees his son, but the demon has discovered josh's presence and attacks them. in search of their physical bodies, josh and dalton flee the demon's lair, with the demon in pursuit. just before the two awaken, josh leaves his son to confront the shadowy old woman who appears to be inside his house. as he shouts for her to get away from him, screaming that he isn't afraid of her, she retreats into the darkness. moments later, josh and dalton both awaken, just as all the spirits vanish. with the family now happily reunited, renai, dalton, and lorraine chat in the kitchen as elise and josh pack up from the long night. josh hands elise the pictures from his childhood, and as she takes them from his hands, she senses something and takes a picture of josh. he promptly goes into a rage, screaming that she knows that he doesn't like to get photographed, and leaps on her before strangling her to death. renai hears josh yelling and goes into the room to find elise dead and josh gone. she searches for josh and finds everyone is gone, the house dead silent. she looks and comes across elise's camera, seeing a picture in it of the shadowy old woman. it's revealed that what elise saw was josh's old and dirty hand and nails, similar to the old woman's, implying that she has possessed him. josh then puts his hand on renai's shoulder, saying \"renai, i'm right here,\" and horror envelops her face as she looks behind her. in a post-credits scene, the shadowy, old woman can be seen blowing out a candle and the screen fades into total darkness."

        "text": "After really enjoying Teriffier 2 I was beyond excited to see the next instalment. And for 90% of the movie it was everything I hoped it&#39;d be. It was more of the same from Art the clown, and after feeling very little for Sienna in the previous movie, I found myself actually caring for the character throughout the third movie. It fleshes out her story perfectly, and I cannot remember the last time I was emotionally invested in a character from a horror movie. The kills themselves are also what I&#39;d hoped, if not a little bit more than what I expected. Indeed I don&#39;t think anything will surpass the bleach and salt scene in the second movie, but these murders had me squirming in my seat.<br/><br/>So this will bring me to the closing 20 minutes of the movie, which was a mess. The scene jump goes from 0 to 100, but it just leaves you confused on what exactly happened, and if you somehow missed 5 minutes of the movie. It&#39;s choppy and sudden, and doesn&#39;t really flow with the rest of the movie. Art also kills Sienna&#39;s brother, which while I wouldn&#39;t mind given I found him very annoying, it happens completely off screen. I don&#39;t understand why they decided to leave it out, but obviously it would be a kill that would seem important to show. They also setup a demon possession story throughout the movie, which looked like it was referring to the little girl we saw in the second movie, but it&#39;s actually the woman who survived Art&#39;s attack in the first movie, which just didn&#39;t really stick and felt lazy. I&#39;d have less issues with the story if she wasn&#39;t possessed and simply turned into Art&#39;s buddy. It felt unnecessary and came across as goofy and pointless.<br/><br/>So the final scene really killed the movie for me. Terrifier 3 was close if not equal to Terrfier 2, but the odd writing and confusing ending leaves it as a rather mediocre slasher. The blood was fun, but the conclusion was not.<br/><br/>6/10."

It did add new things to Art&#39;s repertoire but it didn&#39;t have the same effect on me.<br/><br/>A lot more happened off screen that diminished the &quot;in your face&quot; attitude the first two movies had. And I&#39;m not talking about a certain scene that went amiss towards the end, that was most likely the only bit of actual storytelling that took place and left the audience guessing.<br/><br/>No, probably budget cuts to....

        "text": "I&#39;ve seen parts 1 and 2 and applauded this take on a new horror character to stand up with Freddy Kruger. The dark humor and crazy creative kills continue in part 3, but at times I felt that Art was mimicking himself and was too self aware and appreciative, rather than organically funny. (Like in the sun glasses scene in part 2).<br/><br/>The female companion to Art was interesting but I grew tired of her and she seemed to interfere with Art at times.<br/><br/>The special effects gore is off the chart and surprisingly realistic. I see part 3 as a worthy effort to explore some other avenues, but risks sending the overall concept on a detour that could easily end the series. I enjoyed parts 1 and 2 more. The last scene which lays some foundation for #4 looks like a good start. The producers have a goose that has laid some golden eggs, they need to be careful not to kill it."

        "text": "Too long, too disjointed, and more like a collection of random ideas strung together with duct tape. Sure, the practical gore effects are o.k. But beyond that? It&#39;s a hot mess. The plot is nonexistent, the messianic arc for Sienna Shaw feels forced, and continuity has taken a backseat to shock value. It&#39;s as if Leone&#39;s trying to ride the wave of the franchise&#39;s success by throwing every half-baked idea at the screen, hoping something sticks. Unfortunately, the only thing that sticks is the blood. Art delivers another night to dismember, but as far as coherent storytelling goes? Don&#39;t bother looking for it here. It&#39;s not horror, it&#39;s a lazy bloodbath that thinks shock value is a substitute for storytelling."

The first is this movies budget must&#39;ve been the most by far, and it shows. It had some very creative horror scenes. The acting was great as well. I also enjoyed the run time, I thought that 2 hours was a good amount of time. Now for some negatives in my opinion. I thought that it was odd that terrifier didn&#39;t have the little girl in this movie and they decided to go with the other girl. I also personally don&#39;t like Christmas movies. The third act seemed very rushed. I may be in the minority here, but I feel as though the second movie was the best out of the three. This one had great shock value but the story was not up to par."

        "text": "For gorehounds, Damien Leone&#39;s 2016 offering &#39;Terrifier&#39; was a bloody good time. A violent splatter-fest that didn&#39;t try to be anything other than that, it followed Art the Clown on a murderous Halloween night rampage. It&#39;s follow-up, 2022&#39;s &#39;Terrifier 2,&#39; was an improvement in almost every regard: bigger, funnier and bloodier. Both films were met with critical acclaim (from a certain kind of critic, that is) and did good business at the box office. Self-funded, Leone&#39;s first two &#39;Terrifier&#39; films are gruesome, grisly, grand guignol masterpieces. Can &#39;Terrifier 3&#39; live up to its predecessors?<br/><br/>The third instalment in the franchise once again follows everyone&#39;s favourite mute psychopath, Art the Clown. It is Christmastime and, united with his newly-birthed head (watch the second film for this to make any semblance of sense) and resplendent in a Santa costume, Art embarks on another killing spree. Meanwhile, Sienna Shaw- the heroine from &#39;Terrifier 2&#39;- is trying to move on with her life, after her close shave with the fiendish clown five years earlier. Art, however, has other plans for Sienna.<br/><br/>&#39;Terrifier 3&#39; is not an insightful movie. It doesn&#39;t have a message, or explore any themes, or contain satirical weight. Leone isn&#39;t interested in that. He isn&#39;t trying to make &#39;It Follows,&#39; or &#39;Smile,&#39; or &#39;Rosemary&#39;s Baby.&#39; He doesn&#39;t want to make a horror with depth and nuance. He is out to make a spectacle of splatter; a celebration of blood, guts and gore. He aims to out-do other horror directors by upping the ante when it comes to carnage, by throwing everything, including the kitchen sink and the plumber, at viewers in an attempt to provide thrills and chills. He succeeds.<br/><br/>Armed with a bigger budget than before, Leone crafts a brilliantly brutal festival of the extreme that is a worthy addition to the &#39;Terrifier&#39; franchise. It is wilder, funnier and darker than its predecessors. Over-the-top and excessively bloody, if you expect Leone to operate within the confines of what is traditionally called &#39;good taste,&#39; you&#39;ll be in for a bitter disappointment. He doesn&#39;t just push boundaries, he beats them up and breaks them down, with a hatchet to the head and a screwdriver to the spleen.<br/><br/>Having said that, scenes that don&#39;t feature any violence are generally hammy, lacking power or momentum. While Sienna is still a compelling character, Leone&#39;s often awkward dialogue and cliched characterisation means the film has a tendency towards the dull when Art, and his accomplice Victoria, aren&#39;t on screen. Although handled better than in the first two films, these moments- which are the bulk of the narrative, really- underscore the fact that Leone&#39;s strengths lie not with narrative or characterisation, but with creative, insane bloodshed.<br/><br/>Which, thankfully, the film is full of. The practical effects and make-up are breathtakingly gruesome, and the action sequences are fabulously unhinged and brutal- yet funny. The film is reminiscent of Sam Raimi&#39;s &#39;Evil Dead 2&#39;, successfully balancing extreme bloodshed with dark comedy. While not as accomplished or as consistently amusing as Raimi&#39;s film, it&#39;s still hauntingly hilarious, full of unexpected moments of macabre madness.<br/><br/>Moreover, Olga Turka&#39;s production design is commendable, effectively contrasting violence with an innocuous Christmastime aesthetic. Leone and director of photography George Steuber&#39;s cinematography also impresses, compounding the film&#39;s suspenseful atmosphere. Paul Wiley&#39;s score is similarly effective at generating dread and mood, and the whole affair is well-edited, meaning that, even in its weaker moments, it doesn&#39;t drag.<br/><br/>As in the first two, the film&#39;s main strength lies with David Howard Thornton&#39;s incredible performance as Art the Clown. His is a masterpiece of physicality, as if Buster Keaton were reincarnated via some evil ritual. Thornton&#39;s background as a mime aids him immeasurably, and he portrays the sadistic killer&#39;s perverse glee and menacing mirth with aplomb. Over the three films, Thornton has created one of the best horror characters in years; his performance alone should have viewers clamouring for a &#39;Terrifier 4.&#39;<br/><br/>Lauren LaVera also impresses in the role of Sierra, demonstrating the character&#39;s underlying trauma quite effectively. Although she has many awkward lines to deliver, she does so well, making for a compelling protagonist. Samantha Scaffidi is great in the all-too-small role of Victoria, Art&#39;s accomplice, while Antonella Rose and Margaret Anne Florence do fine work as Sierra&#39;s cousin and aunt, respectfully. Additionally, Daniel Roebuck leaves a positive impression as a doomed Santa impersonator, as does Alexa Blair Robertson as a podcaster. (Horror fans will also take note that the great Tom Savini makes an appearance, albeit in a blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-it cameo).<br/><br/>In conclusion, Damien Leone&#39;s &#39;Terrifier 3&#39; is a bloody, brutal and brilliant horror comedy, brimming with the macabre menace the franchise is known for. Featuring remarkable practical effects and make-up, as well as an emotive score and fine cinematography, it is a wild ride from start to finish. Full of over-the-top violence, and boasting a terrific central performance from David Howard Thornton, &#39;Terrifier 3&#39; is scarily good."

        "text": "Listen: I&#39;m not traditionally a gore guy. So when my girlfriend asked me to watch the first two Terrifiers to get ready for this one, I was not too excited. Turns out I love ALL of them. But this one, Terrifier 3, is special. I mean it when I say I haven&#39;t laughed that hard in a theater in a long time. Leave it to art the clown&#39;s deviant ridiculousness to make me smile! It is so over the top, so batshit, to the point that the kills become some creative and intentionally hilarious that I can&#39;t hold it in anymore. He&#39;s a truly special villain because he&#39;s as scary as he is funny. That&#39;s very hard to do. And Damien Leone struck gold with art the clown. He&#39;s the 2020&#39;s slasher hero no questions asked. And this franchise will go down as one of horror&#39;s greatest. If you&#39;re a horror fan you definitely need to watch all of them. They each have their own identity. The 3rd one is my favorite even though the second might be the best and has the most classic scenes. So so fun!"

        "text": "Terrifier 3 is undoubtedly one of the sadistic movies I&#39;ve encountered. The film shows a complete disregard for its characters, whether they are children, animals, or adults-there&#39;s no safe haven from the brutal violence. It&#39;s clear that this film will not sit well with many viewers, especially those who&#39;s sensitive.<br/><br/>As a horror enthusiast who&#39;s watched hundreds of movies, I must say that while I understand why fans might appreciate it. Yes, there were exciting scenes, but I also found myself bored at some scenes.<br/><br/>-Excessive and Unnecessary Violence-\nFrom start to finish, the film is packed with grotesque scenes that seem designed to provoke disgust rather than fear. The violence is so relentless that it becomes numbing rather than horrifying, with many moments feeling gratuitous. Even kids aren&#39;t spared, which crosses a line from horror into something that just feels wrong and uncomfortable. Instead of building suspense or offering any real psychological tension, Terrifier 3 seems to thrive solely on shock value.<br/><br/>-Chaotic Plot and Underdeveloped Characters-\nAnother big issue for me was the chaotic narrative. While the film introduces elements of supernatural lore and brings back characters like Sienna from the previous film, these plot threads feel underdeveloped and overshadowed by the excessive gore. Art the Clown, while still a creepy and effective villain, can&#39;t carry the film alone. The other characters feel flat and undeveloped, making it hard to care about their fates.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes I like:<br/><br/>Interestingly, my favorite moment came during the bar scene, which offered a unique twist amidst the chaos.<br/><br/>Sienna&#39;s visions at the dinner table effectively shows her psychological struggles."

Scenes of Selina coming over to her family&#39;s house and just having &quot;hey how are you&quot; conversations for an hour is just boring. In between there are kills executed Art that have nothing to do with anyone or anything pertaining to the main characters. It just feels like they&#39;re trying to form some type of plot and just scatter kills here and there. And again in this installment, there is no plot and no story.<br/><br/>There is one difference between this one and the other two, the creators try to explain what Art is - and they should&#39;ve kept it to themselves. So there&#39;s some type of demon that&#39;s possessing a girl he killed and now it hangs out with Art? What?<br/><br/>In the end the little girl gets sucked into a random hole with Selena declaring, &quot;I will find you...&quot; I&#39;m guessing to steer us into thinking there will be a fourth Terrifier movie. I will not see the next one.<br/><br/>Save yourself some time and just find a way to watch all the kills online somehow because that&#39;s really the only reason to watch any of this franchise.

In fact, a description of Terrifier 3&#39;s plot wouldn&#39;t be much longer than a summary of one Friends episode. Instead of answering the questions from the previous installment, the movie just brings up even more questions for the now-confirmed sequel, which may unsatisfy some fans, but at the same time already creates hype for Terrifier 4.<br/><br/>Production values are miles ahead of the previous films and it is pleasing to se Damien Leone improve so much in his craft.<br/><br/>As for the period before the release of the film, I personally think some of the marketing choices were a bit over-the-top, such as the release of an official hot-line, but that doesn&#39;t diminish the quality of the movie itself.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is an improvement over the previous installments and it will definetely satisfy you if you are a Terrifier/slasher fan."

Art and Victoria kill a nurse and a guard and flee to an abandoned house. Victoria slashes her wrists and enters a bathtub hibernation while Art sits dormant in the attic. Five years later Sienna is released from a psychiatric facility and moves in with her Aunt Jess, uncle Greg, and niece Gabbie in Miles County. Sienna suffers hallucinations of her dead friend Brooke and struggles to reconnect with her younger brother Jonathan, now a college student. Two demolition workers discover the abandoned house and awaken Art and Victoria; they kill the workers. Victoria begins making a costume while Art resumes killing. At a bar Art meets a Santa impersonator, shoots the bartender and a patron, steals a Santa suit, murders the impersonator using liquid nitrogen and a hammer, then later axes a family at their home while dressed as Santa. Art impersonates Santa at a shopping mall and hides explosives in gifts, detonating them to slaughter shoppers and children. Sienna briefly thinks she sees Art at the mall but keeps quiet, unsure if it's a hallucination. Sienna visits Jonathan at university and meets his roommate Cole and Cole's girlfriend Mia, who hosts a true-crime podcast. Mia pressures Sienna and Jonathan for an interview; Sienna lashes out and later tells Jonathan she believes Art is reborn and possessed others, citing letters Jonathan sent her from the hospital about demons reborn through recently deceased evil humans. Art attacks the university, killing Mia and Cole with a chainsaw in the showers. News of the mall bombing reaches Sienna; she panics and tells Jonathan to come home. Greg leaves to fetch Jonathan. Sienna dreams of angels forging armor from her father's warrior costume design, then wakes to find Art and Victoria in the house. Art incapacitates her with a mallet. She awakens to Greg's decapitated body pinned to the wall, his head used as the Christmas tree's star, and Jess tied up. Victoria presents a skinless head she claims is Gabbie's, forces rats to eat Jess by hammering a tube into her mouth and using a blowtorch, then slits Jess's throat. Art returns with Gabbie as a hostage and reveals the decapitated head is Jonathan's. Victoria crowns Sienna with thorns and attempts to possess her, but Sienna resists. Sienna tricks them into letting her open a wrapped \"present,\" then stabs Victoria with her father's sword and decapitates her; Victoria's body disintegrates. Victoria's blood burns through the floor and opens a portal; Gabbie slips and falls in, clutching the sword. Sienna rushes to save Gabbie but gabbie falls into the abyss. Art attacks with a chainsaw; Sienna gains the upper hand and wounds heal supernaturally. Art flees through a window and escapes on a bus.

That music makes the scene two times better.<br/><br/>If I had to mention the minor flaws, here is one example. I don&#39;t know why the car parking and all the other areas so dark and feels abandoned? I know, It&#39;s because this is a horror movie and the movie tries to scare you.

        "text": "Two seemingly unrelated people (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whinnell) wake up in a secluded, dingy bathroom, chained to the wall. With nothing but their wits, a few clues, and a hacksaw, they must figure out who put them in their predicament and how to get out. Well, assuming they&#39;re able to get out. For an added bonus, one of the men has a kidnapped family on the outside.<br/><br/>Falsely categorized as &quot;torture porn&quot; (the violence and gore here are more in line with &quot;Seven&quot; than &quot;Hostel&quot;), this film was the first smart horror film of the 2000s. Intelligent horror fans not only got the blood they wanted, but a clever villain and a mystery to solve. Later sequels would get more complicated than episodes of &quot;Lost&quot;, and the series loses something as it goes (all franchises do), but this original stands as one of the modern greats. And, luckily, you can watch it without any of the sequels and it makes sense.<br/><br/>There has been an effort in recent years to academically analyze &quot;Saw&quot;, injecting a false connotation on to the film. One scholarly article points to the &quot;militarization&quot; of Jigsaw in a post-9/11 world. Jigsaw, like the military, carries out violent acts, but has found ways to rationalize them with moral justifications (saving the worthy, letting the undeserving die). The author makes various other parallels about a &quot;military&quot; setting, mentioning IEDs and the industrial setting of Jigsaw&#39;s workshop. I find this to be largely silly, and not at all the creators&#39; intention. I see a much more obvious line of progression from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; to &quot;Seven&quot; to &quot;Saw&quot; with the advent of the brilliant, self-moralizing serial killer. Even Hitchcock&#39;s &quot;Rope&quot; offered a justification for murder, albeit a poor one. Terrorism or not, the horror film will go on.<br/><br/>You can make complaints, sure. But for young writers and directors, this was a blockbuster and deserved the massive success it got. As someone who pays close attention to a film&#39;s writing and plot, I was stunned. My only real concern is at the very end, when the key&#39;s location is revealed. I can&#39;t discuss this in a review, but let&#39;s just say I found that to be uncharacteristic and unfair of the killer.<br/><br/>If you haven&#39;t seen &quot;Saw&quot; yet, see it. And see the second film. After that, they start to go downhill. But the first two are quite good and must-see viewing for all horror fans."

        "text": "The Saw movies tend to get a pretty bad rap. Most people think of them as senselessly violent and overly gory torture fests with no actual interesting plots or characters. Granted, some of the movies are like that. But, when you watch this 2004 original, leave those expectations at the door, because this movie is just a genuinely good thriller and mystery.<br/><br/>This movie has an intriguing premise of two strangers waking up in a room, handcuffed to pipes. As the move progresses, this mystery unfolds as we learn more and more about these two characters and about the situation that they are in. There are many twists and turns as the movie unfolds, but they never feel forced. These twists feel organic and are truly shocking. Because of this, I don&#39;t think of this movie really as a horror movie. It feels more like a mystery thriller, and it draws you into its premise. However, it is a very tense movie and there are some frightening scenes, so it does succeed as a horror movie as well.<br/><br/>If gore is the main thing keeping you from watching this movie, I would give it a try. Granted, there is gore in this movie, but it&#39;s not nearly as much as you would expect from a movie these days with Saw in the name. The gore is never intrusive or over-the-top, and it certainly is never meant to be the point of the movie. If you cannot watch gore at all, there may be a couple of scenes where you&#39;ll want to close your eyes, but there is still so much to enjoy from this movie outside of those moments."

        "text": "Not since Se7en&#39;s John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions (not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone; more on that later). Sure, in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it&#39;s hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise- starter (something the writer and director never planned), but viewed on its own, astonishing merits, it&#39;s a good, nasty thriller, filled with solid scares and (especially compared to the follow-ups) quite well written.<br/><br/>According to the film&#39;s notorious back-story, it took only 28 days to shoot it. Not that strange, given most of the action takes place in just two locations: one is a bathroom where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) fins themselves with their feet chained to the wall, with no recollection whatsoever of how the hell they got there; the other is the lair of the mysterious Jigsaw, a serial killer whom Detectives Sing (Ken Leung) and Trapp (Danny Glover) have been tracking down for weeks.<br/><br/>The two facts are linked in a most ingenious way: Jigsaw doesn&#39;t really kill anyone, but &quot;plays a game&quot; with his victims. In the case of Adam and Dr. Gordon, as the tape recorder found in a dead man&#39;s hand tells them, each of them has two hours to free himself and kill the other, or they will both die. Problem is, the only way to get rid of the chains is to saw your foot off. And so, while the two unfortunate cell-mates have to choose who gets to live (that&#39;s Jigsaw&#39;s perverse logic: he offers you a choice), the police close in on the elusive psycho, whose previous deeds and MO are shown in flashbacks.<br/><br/>Whereas the subsequent Saw films use the messy chronology just for the hell of it (though they do get away with some neat narrative tweaks thanks to it), the first installment takes advantage of its non-linear storytelling to increase the suspense and provide some valuable clues to how everything fits together. It is to James Wan and co-writer Whannell&#39;s eternal credit that they, like Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker, went beyond slasher clichés and came up with something more. Okay, so Saw&#39;s philosophical undertones aren&#39;t entirely original, but what the heck, they do manage to keep the audience interested in what&#39;s going on. In addition, adding a little more depth to the killer ensures that the movie&#39;s more gruesome parts (and there are a lot of them) don&#39;t come off as gratuitous bloodletting (for an example of the latter, look no further than the countless sequels to A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday 13th).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the intelligence behind the film&#39;s structure might also have had a positive effect on the performances, given the acting is more convincing here than in most post-2000 shockers: Elwes and Whannell&#39;s desperation is conveyed with an intensity that&#39;s almost too painful to behold, Glover plays the aging cop role resisting the temptation to do a Lethal Weapon in-joke (you know, the &quot;too old for this sh*t&quot; gag) and when Jigsaw himself appears... well, it&#39;s the horror equivalent of Keyser Soze - chilling and impossible to forget (and, for once, not played by Kevin Spacey). Just like the movie."

        "text": "Since &quot;Nattevagten&quot; I have not seen a thriller that has kept me on the edge of my seat as well as &quot;Saw&quot;. Right from the beginning this original story sucks you in and doesn&#39;t let you go until the very end. Thrillers as gripping as this one have become extremely rare in times like these, where people have seen almost everything and can guess any twist during the first half of the movie. With &quot;Saw&quot; James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the creative heads behind this project, set new standards. Think you&#39;re hard-boiled? Think again and watch &quot;Saw&quot;, a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.<br/><br/>&quot;Saw&quot; has been advertised as the new &quot;Se7en&quot; and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, &quot;Saw&quot; does a much better job at actually being creepy. Jigsaw is the most gruesome killer the cinema has seen in a loooong time. Wan and Whannel really came up with a monster that has no peer. Where many movies drift into ridiculousness trying to establish the villain as an almost superhuman evil being, &quot;Saw&quot; does never get anywhere near that trap. Sure, the cops are depicted way too stupid and the killer is unrealistically smart, outshining each and every opponent with his perfect plans, but hey, &quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; didn&#39;t care too much about realism, either, did they?<br/><br/>&quot;Saw&quot; does have some flaws. Those sped-up tracking shots have just been used too many times by now, the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another, some characters&#39; lines are a bit clichéd. However, considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all, it&#39;s really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties, when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.<br/><br/>I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve been surprised by a movie&#39;s final twist, but &quot;Saw&quot; has an ending that I didn&#39;t see coming at all. This thriller is the most original piece of independent film-making since &quot;Cube&quot;. I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing how Wan and Whannell&#39;s career develops after this fine sleeper."

Instead of slowly building status by making mediocre films, he showed the world right from the get-go that he had something to prove.<br/><br/>Along with Silence Of The Lambs, Saw is the only horror movie that truly chills me. You see, I am not easily frightened by gratuitous bloodshed and screams that you might see in films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The plot has to be coherent, and there can&#39;t be anything ridiculous like a monster. Saw evokes strong emotions of terror and fear, all the while remaining plausible. Well, the story is actually unlikely, but everything in the film is physically possible.<br/><br/>The scenes that are meant to be frightening don&#39;t require things that jump out at you every two seconds, or cheesy orchestral flailings. The situation is what frightens you, not the presentation. Saw does have some second-rate acting, but then again it is a low-budget film and I suppose they couldn&#39;t exactly afford Robert De Niro. The script is not fantastic, but one true redeeming quality of the whole film is the story. It is dense, complex, but so captivating. I can only think of a few mystery plot lines that can even compare to this one. The Usual Suspects is probably up there, but Saw stands alone.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film who appreciate good stories, and aren&#39;t easily scared by the garbage you see in theaters like House Of Wax. For people who get squeamish, steer clear of this film. It is very nice graphic, and very sadistic at times. A brilliant debut, and a terrifying ride. 9/10."

      "plot_summary": "Photographer Adam Faulkner wakes up in a bathtub in a grimy industrial bathroom; as the water drains a small glowing object is briefly seen disappear down the plughole. Adam discovers he is chained by the ankle to a pipe at one corner of the room. On the opposite side Dr. Lawrence Gordon, a surgeon, is likewise chained; between them lies a dead man clutching a revolver and a micro-cassette player. Each man finds a cassette in his pocket. Playing them, Adam hears a taunting voice calling him a voyeur and demanding he act; Lawrence's tape orders him to kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife Alison and daughter will be killed and he will remain chained forever. They find hacksaws hidden in the toilet tank but discover the saws are too dull to cut metal chain; they deduce the saws are meant to sever their own ankles. Detectives David Tapp and Steven Sing are investigating previous victims of the same killer (dubbed the \"Jigsaw\" killer) and question Amanda Young, the only known survivor, in flashbacks. Flashbacks also show earlier Jigsaw traps (Paul and Mark) and an interrupted attempt by Tapp and Sing to capture the killer, during which Tapp is slashed and Sing later dies in a booby-trapped house. Back in the bathroom, Lawrence and Adam find a hidden camera and later a box containing cigarettes, a lighter, a note, and a cell phone. The note suggests Lawrence dip a cigarette in poisoned blood and use it to kill Adam; Lawrence and Adam stage Adam's fake death to trick the camera, but an electric shock proves Adam is still alive. Alison calls Lawrence on the cell phone and tells him Adam knows more than he has admitted; Adam admits he was hired by Tapp to spy on Lawrence and has photographs showing an orderly named Zep outside Lawrence's house. At six o'clock Alison attempts to fight off Zep, who has entered her house; she is overpowered but manages to arm herself briefly before Tapp arrives and wounds Zep. Zep flees toward the bathroom. Lawrence, desperate to obey his tape and save his family, uses the hacksaw to sever his own right foot at the ankle, constrains himself to the floor enough to reach the revolver from the dead man's hand, and shoots Adam in the abdomen. Zep bursts into the bathroom and shoots Tapp fatally when Tapp pursues him; Zep tells Lawrence \"it's the rules.\" Adam, still alive, kills Zep with the toilet tank lid. Lawrence drags himself out promising to return with help; Adam searches Zep and finds another cassette player. The tape reveals Zep was also forced to follow orders. The supposedly dead man in the center of the room removes a latex piece that faked his head wound and stands up: he is John Kramer, a terminally ill patient previously treated by Dr. Gordon and the real Jigsaw. John speaks weakly from a hidden monitor, explains the key to Adam's chain was in the bathtub and had been lost down the drain at the film's start, and reiterates his philosophy about forcing victims to appreciate life. John delivers a final taunting speech, stuns Adam with an electrical device, plays a montage of the night's events, slams the bathroom door and locks it, sealing Adam inside as John declares \"game over.\"",

      "the film begins with photographer adam faulkner (leigh whannell) waking up in a bathtub filled with water. in his instinctive flailing, his foot catches and removes its plug; as the water drains a glowing blue object can be briefly seen to be washed away with it. after a few cries for help it is revealed that he is not, in fact, alone. surgeon dr. lawrence gordon (cary elwes) is on the other side of the same room, and soon finds the switch to turn on the lights. both men are inside a grimy, dilapidated industrial bathroom, chained to pipes at opposite corners of the room. between them, out of their reach, is a body lying in a pool of blood, holding a revolver and a micro-cassette recorder. both men discover envelopes in their pockets which contain micro-tapes; gordon also holds a bullet and a key that does not unlock their shackles. adam, with lawrence's help, manages to snag the player from the body with which they play their tapes. both tapes have the same voice, distorted by a pitch modulator. adam's tape refers to him as a voyeur and asks, \"are you going to watch yourself die, or do something about it?\" gordon's tape reveals he must kill adam before six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will die and he will be left in the bathroom, presumably forever. hacksaws are soon discovered in the toilet tank; neither is sufficiently sharp to cut chain, and adam accidentally snaps his in frustration. dr. gordon realizes that the saws are meant instead for their own ankles, which, if sawed through, would free them from their shackles. the film then presents flashbacks of their captor's previous victims: paul and mark. both men failed to escape, and hence had pieces of skin cut from them in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece; thus, the genesis for referring to him as the \"jigsaw killer\" by the detectives tapp (danny glover), sing (ken leung) and kerry (dina meyer) who investigate the murders. back in the bathroom, dr. gordon comments that this is a misnomer, as he never directly murders his victims nor places them in situations where death is unavoidable. in yet another flashback we are shown the police interrogation (with dr. gordon witnessing behind a window) of jigsaw's only known survivor, a highly traumatized heroin addict named amanda young (shawnee smith), who believes that her experience in the test has made her a better person in the end. after a brief sequence where adam and dr. gordon discover a hidden camera, another flashback sequence shows gordon's last moments with his family, and their subsequent abduction. another flashback shows an attempt by tapp and sing illegally breaking and entering into what turns out to be one of jigsaw's lairs. the two discover a man tied to a chair with two drills mounted on each side. before the detectives can secure jigsaw's arrest, he starts the drills. while tapp subdues jigsaw, sing attempts to save jeff. though jigsaw helpfully points out a box that contains the key to release jeff, the box in question is seemingly endlessly filled with keys; sing shoots the drills instead, but the gunshots distract tapp long enough for jigsaw to escape, who slashes and permanently scars tapp's throat in the process. while tapp recovers from his deep knife wound, sing pursues jigsaw and is killed by multiple shotguns set on a tripwire. his partner's death has a permanent effect on tapp, and what was already an unhealthy fascination with the case deepens into an obsession that leads to him being discharged from the police force. convinced from a piece of evidence from earlier in the film that dr. gordon is the jigsaw killer, tapp moves into a house across the street from gordon's and monitors it with video surveillance. back in the bathroom, gordon (with assistance from adam) discovers a box holding cigarettes, a lighter and a note suggesting he dip a cigarette in poisoned blood and uses it to kill adam. gordon and adam attempt to fool the camera by faking adam's death with the cigarette that was not poisoned, but a strong electric shock is sent through adam's chain, proving adam to still be alive. the box also contains a cell phone which cannot make calls but receives one from his wife alison (monica potter), who tells gordon that adam knows more than he is revealing. adam explains that he had been paid by detective tapp to spy on gordon and has witnessed him going to a hotel with the intention of cheating on his wife. in fact, gordon left the hotel before doing anything, but this is between gordon and the other woman, carla (one of the med students to which gordon had been explaining the condition of a patient of his, john kramer), and no mention is made of possible previous encounters. in the pile of adam's photographs which he hid from view of gordon when found with the hacksaws, the two find a photograph of an orderly at gordon's hospital named zep, seen through gordon's window after he left the house. just as this realization is made, however, the hour of six pm strikes. alison manages to free herself and take control of zep's handgun, however she is soon overpowered. shots are fired, which attract the attention of tapp, who wounds zep. he is unable to keep him from leaving the house. zep heads towards the bathroom.\nflung into a state of desperate temporary insanity, gordon follows his instructions by sawing off his foot and shooting adam with the revolver held by the body in the middle of the room and the bullet found in his envelope. zep arrives, pursued by tapp, however zep manages to shoot tapp fatally. he then enters the bathroom but tells gordon he's \"too late,\" because \"it's the rules.\" adam recovers from his gunshot wound, which was in fact non-fatal, and kills zep with the toilet tank lid. gordon crawls away to seek medical attention, promising to return with help. adam searches zep for a key to his chain and instead finds another micro-cassette player. as the climatic theme of the series, \"hello zep\", begins, the tape informs adam, that zep was also following instructions under pain of death. as soon as jigsaw's familiar voice ceases, the body lying in the center of the bathroom lets out a long breath. as adam watches, his face frozen in horror, the dead man peels off the latex that gave the appearance of his head wound and then slowly rises to his feet. he is john kramer, a terminal brain cancer patient of gordon's; he is seen, briefly, in the same flashback where zep is (equally briefly) introduced. jigsaw, whose voice is in fact quite weak, informs adam that the key to his chain was in the bathtub all along; a quick flashback replays the opening scene of the movie, where an object is seen to disappear down the drain with the water. adam reaches for a gun to shoot john, but is stunned with electricity, triggering an extended flashback sequence that runs through the vital shots of the movie in roughly 30 seconds. just before he flicks off the lights in the bathroom for the last time, john repeats a line he said to amanda immediately after she escaped: \"most people are so ungrateful to be alive. but not you. not anymore.\" john then shouts \"game over!\" before slamming the door shut, sealing adam in the bathroom forever, screaming his despair over the credits."

Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills&#39; wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband&#39;s life and is very depressed.<br/><br/>Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that&#39;s appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.<br/><br/>If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It&#39;s depressing and unpleasant but riveting."

        "text": "It is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping.<br/><br/>David Fincher&#39;s story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city (never named) where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant. Coming up to his retirement from the police force is Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) before leaving. Somerset is world weary, under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and (initially) wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city. Mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct, bringing his wife to the city with him. Before Somerset can move on, a homicide comes in which he and Mills are assigned to investigate. But its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in Dante&#39;s &quot;The divine comedy&quot;.<br/><br/>To begin with, Se7en appears to be a standard &quot;cops on the trail of a killer&quot; story which shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with. But as we descend along with the characters into the merciless, brutal world without hope that they inhabit, you are left reeling at the events that unfold.<br/><br/>The two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them. The older Somerset is educated, astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out. Mills, who has no respect for Somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually. The further we get into the action, the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits.<br/><br/>This film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (1957). Both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all.<br/><br/>Se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. The killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. It is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, Somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. This is lost on Mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point.<br/><br/>A previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching Se7en and i completely agree. Eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen, it usually does. Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope. This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher didn&#39;t pick up another script for 18 months, such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of Alien 3. Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity. He stated: &quot;It&#39;s psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it&quot;. For the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score.<br/><br/>The Most disturbing message that Se7en puts across, is that the fight against evil is destined to be a Pyrrhic victory. But regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost. We have no other choice.<br/><br/>&quot;The World is a fine place and worth fighting for.&quot; I agree with the second part."

        "text": "The movie, &quot;Se7en&quot;, starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri&#39;s seven deadly sins from &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, sets out to, &quot;preach&quot; about man&#39;s impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film&#39;s conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en&#39;s surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en&#39;s poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br/><br/>Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90&#39;s. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br/><br/>Score 10/10."

        "text": "From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill&#39;s uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn&#39;t in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "text": "After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990&#39;s. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist&#39;s depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.<br/><br/>Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words &#39;greed&#39; written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word &#39;gluttony&#39; etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious &#39;John Doe&#39; is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.<br/><br/>When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe&#39;s reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. &quot;Wanting people to listen, you can&#39;t just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,&quot; he says. It&#39;s about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills&#39; wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

        "text": "Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (&quot;This isn&#39;t going to be a happy ending&quot;) or Dante&#39;s Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film&#39;s final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet&#39;s particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).<br/><br/>Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film&#39;s astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird&#39;s-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman&#39;s kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film&#39;s closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.<br/><br/>This is Somerset&#39;s vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)<br/><br/>Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.<br/><br/>This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first."

Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he&#39;s a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That&#39;s a shame because he is a talented actor that isn&#39;t afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.<br/><br/>\nThe real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher&#39;s talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. <br/><br/>John Doe&#39;s plan really is twisted and I won&#39;t be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can&#39;t keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you haven&#39;t had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn&#39;t is because you&#39;re just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore."

I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  &quot;Se7en&quot; is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It&#39;s  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché&#39;s. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene&#39;s, this seriously ain&#39;t no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren&#39;t just only the gross scene&#39;s that are good, there are also some  scene&#39;s that are made with lot&#39;s of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.

Somerset and Mills investigate a grisly murder of an obese man found forced to eat himself to death; the word \"GLUTTONY\" is written on the wall. They are alerted to a second crime scene: a prominent defense attorney murdered with a pound of his flesh removed and the word \"GREED\" scrawled. Forensic clues (an upside-down picture and hidden fingerprints) lead Somerset and Mills to an apartment where they find a severely emaciated drug dealer and child molester who has been held and photographed over a year — the victim of \"SLOTH.\" Library records and detective work link the crimes to a man using the name John Doe. Mills chases Doe across rooftops; Mills falls and is later knocked unconscious, letting Doe escape briefly. The detectives search Doe's apartment and find notebooks detailing meticulous planning and a clue to a subsequent murder. They arrive too late to prevent Doe from forcing a man at gunpoint to rape and kill a prostitute (\"LUST\"). Next the detectives find a mutilated model who chose suicide over living disfigured (\"PRIDE\").\n\nDoe unexpectedly surrenders to police, covered in blood. He offers to confess but insists on escorting Somerset and Mills to a remote location where he will reveal the last two victims (\"ENVY\" and \"WRATH\"). During the drive Doe calmly lectures them about morality, revealing his crimes are designed as righteous punishment using the seven deadly sins. At the deserted drop site a delivery van arrives with a sealed box. Somerset opens it and sees something that panics him; Doe declares he represents ENVY, saying he envied Mills' marriage and life. Doe taunts Mills by saying the box contains the severed head of Mills' wife, Tracy, and that she begged for her life and their unborn child. Somerset pleads for Mills not to react, but Mills, consumed by fury, shoots Doe multiple times, enacting \"WRATH.\" Doe dies having orchestrated both his own death and Mills' transformation into the final sin. Police take a broken Mills away; Somerset, who had planned to retire, decides to stay on. The film ends with Somerset's voiceover quoting Hemingway: \"the world is a fine place and worth fighting for,\" and adds, \"I agree with the second part.\"",

        "summary": "For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half",
        "text": "It&#39;s not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn&#39;t like the second half of it.<br/><br/>It&#39;s much easier to understand the message of a movie when the &#39;good guys&#39; win or the &#39;bad guys&#39; get punished in the end. I&#39;m not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there&#39;s a character with a clearer &#39;moral center&#39; whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it&#39;s no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.<br/><br/>Some complained that they don&#39;t understand Ki-Taek&#39;s motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, &quot;crossing the line&quot;.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people&#39;s privacy or as one should mind one&#39;s own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families&#39; respective dwellings.<br/><br/>It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.<br/><br/>Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to &#39;cross the line&#39; if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.<br/><br/>At first, it seems that it&#39;s quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park&#39;s house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park&#39;s family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn&#39;t even smell like him.<br/><br/>Ki-Taek&#39;s final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son&#39;s shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek&#39;s daughter&#39;s status who&#39;s dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.<br/><br/>That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.<br/><br/>And he also realizes the &#39;line&#39; that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those &#39;lesser&#39; human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those &#39;proper&#39; human beings.<br/><br/>However easy it was for Ki-Taek&#39;s family to sneak into Mr. Park&#39;s house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park&#39;s family, their existence is no better than that of a &#39;parasite&#39;, which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.<br/><br/>With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host&#39;s body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.<br/><br/>The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park&#39;s or Ki-Taek&#39;s personalities. Instead, it&#39;s a &#39;line&#39; drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.<br/><br/>Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.<br/><br/>But without if the movie didn&#39;t change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."

        "text": "I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I&#39;ll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I&#39;ve rated on here, only 34 have a 10.\nParasite is one of them. If this isn&#39;t a masterpiece, then I don&#39;t know what is.<br/><br/>I&#39;m going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn&#39;t know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.<br/><br/>What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I&#39;ve seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I&#39;m honestly not sure if I&#39;ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).<br/><br/>And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.<br/><br/>I&#39;m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I&#39;ve seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it&#39;s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It&#39;s extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there&#39;s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie&#39;s over (and this one&#39;s not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).<br/><br/>Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one&#39;s), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.<br/><br/>When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."

The movie starts out almost like an &#39;Ocean&#39;s Eleven&#39; heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.<br/><br/>I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.<br/><br/>The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can&#39;t think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with &#39;Parasite&#39; and I think most that give it a chance will too."

        "summary": "Meritocracy: it's metaphorical",
        "text": "In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: &quot;I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.&quot;<br/><br/>The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. &quot;It&#39;s easy to be nice when you&#39;re rich,&quot; the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.<br/><br/>But it&#39;s a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they&#39;ve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.<br/><br/>But in a meritocracy, you can&#39;t blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it&#39;s all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to &quot;metaphors,&quot; and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you&#39;re like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you&#39;ve just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho&#39;s filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he&#39;ll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he&#39;s done so.<br/><br/>I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.<br/><br/>South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can&#39;t afford not to struggle.<br/><br/>The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the &quot;Indians&quot;) looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It&#39;s nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."

As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.<br/><br/>However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."

      "plot_summary": "The Kim family—father Kim Ki-taek, mother Choong-sook, son Ki-woo, and daughter Ki-jeong—live in a semi-basement apartment in Seoul and scrape by doing low-paid odd jobs. Ki-woo's college friend Min-hyuk prepares to study abroad and gives Ki-woo a chance: take Min-hyuk's job tutoring Park Da-hye, daughter of the wealthy Park family, while Min-hyuk is away. Ki-woo accepts, using a forged university degree created by Ki-jeong. At the Parks' modernist house (former architect Namgoong's residence), Ki-woo impresses Mrs. Park and is hired. Learning Mrs. Park needs an art therapist for young Park Da-song, Ki-woo recommends 'Jessica'—Ki-jeong in disguise—who is hired. Ki-jeong engineers the dismissal of the Parks' driver by framing him for sexual harassment, then arranges for Ki-taek to be hired as the new driver. The Kims then manipulate Mrs. Park into firing longtime housekeeper Moon-gwang by falsely suggesting Moon-gwang has tuberculosis; Choong-sook is hired as housekeeper, completing the family's infiltration of the household staff. The Kims enjoy the comfort of the house; Ki-woo and Da-hye begin a romantic connection. While the Parks go on a camping weekend, the Kims throw a drunken party in the mansion. Moon-gwang unexpectedly returns to retrieve something from the basement and reveals a secret bunker where her husband, Geun-sae, has been hiding for four years to escape loan sharks. Moon-gwang records the Kims' true identities and threatens to expose them. The Parks cut their trip short because of heavy rain; the Kims frantically try to hide Moon-gwang and Geun-sae. In a scuffle, Choong-sook pushes Moon-gwang down basement stairs, inflicting a fatal head wound. Moon-gwang later dies of her injury; her husband is freed when Moon-gwang cuts the tape binding him. The storm floods the Kims' apartment; they sleep in a gymnasium while the Parks throw a birthday party for Da-song the next day and ask the staff to assist. Ki-woo takes the 'lucky' rock given earlier by Min-hyuk down to the bunker intending to kill Geun-sae; Geun-sae ambushes Ki-woo, bludgeons him with the rock, then bursts into the party and stabs Ki-jeong in the chest. Da-song's resulting seizure creates chaos; as staff and Parks struggle, Choong-sook fatally stabs Geun-sae with a meat skewer. Mr. Park recoils at Geun-sae's smell; witnessing Mr. Park's disgust and the class contempt in his reaction, Ki-taek snaps and stabs Mr. Park to death, then flees. In the aftermath Ki-jeong dies from her wound; Ki-woo undergoes brain surgery and a coma; Ki-taek evades capture by hiding in the bunker. Ki-woo and Choong-sook face trial and receive probation. Months later Ki-woo, recovering in the semi-basement, watches the Park house and sees a light flickering in Morse code from the basement—the message is from Ki-taek, who survives hidden in the bunker under the house. Ki-woo vows to earn enough money to buy the house and free his father; the film ends with Ki-woo imagining reuniting with Ki-taek while remaining trapped in poverty.",

      "kim ki-taek (song kang-ho), an unemployed driver, lives with his wife choong-sook (jang hye-jin), son ki-woo (choi woo-shik) and daughter ki-jeong (park so-dam) in a shabby semi-basement apartment. the family struggles to survive, working low-paying gigs such as folding pizza boxes. ki-woo's friend min-hyuk (park seo-joon) visits the family and gifts them a large rock supposed to bring them wealth, before he leaves to study abroad. he suggests ki-woo take over his job as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's youngest daughter, da-hye (jung ji-so). min-hyuk has feelings for da-hye and figures that she will be safe with ki-woo, till he graduates college. in the lavish park mansion, ki-woo is interviewed by mrs. park (cho yeo-jeong) to tutor da-hye and is hired after mrs. park sees his talents (his degrees which were faked by his sister ki-jeong who is a master at forgery) in action.\nlearning of mrs. park's struggle to find an art teacher for her younger child, da-song, ki-woo suggests a \"professional\" named jessica, who in reality is ki-jeong. once hired, ki-jeong gets mr. park's (lee sun-kyun) driver fired (the driver hits on ki-jeong and she accuses him of sexual harassment by placing her panties in the back seat of the mercedes he is in charge of) and replaced with her \"uncle kim\": ki-taek. the kims soon get housekeeper moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) fired (moon-kwang had a rule that the family could not eat peaches, but ki-jeong discovers that its because moon-kwang herself is severely allergic to it and the manipulate the park family to believe that moon-kwang had tuberculosis. this enrages mrs. park, who fires her), with choong-sook hired in her place, employing the entire kim family.\nki-woo ends up kissing da-hye and both are attracted to each other. the parks go on an overnight camping trip, leaving the mansion in choong-sook's care. the kims take the opportunity to have a drunken party in the mansion, during which ki-woo confesses to his family that he is in love with da-hye. in the middle of their celebration, moon-kwang (lee jung-eun) rings the bell and claims that she came to retrieve something in the basement. the other kims hide, then choong-sook lets moon-kwang in. heading to the basement, the former housekeeper opens a secret bunker, revealing that her husband, geun-sae (park myung-hoon), has been hiding for 4 years to avoid loan sharks. as choong-sook threatens to call the police, the rest of the kims, eavesdropping, accidentally stumble into view. moon-kwang quickly records footage of the new \"staff\" addressing each other as father and children, then threatens to send the clip to the parks. the parks call choong-sook to announce that the heavy rain has ruined their camping trip, and they will be home soon. the kims scramble to confine moon-kwang and geun-sae, then clean up and hide, while choong-sook prepares some food requested by mrs. park. moon-kwang breaks free and runs up into the kitchen, but choong-sook pushes her down the basement stairs, severely wounding her head. while eating, mrs. park tells choong-sook that her son was traumatized one birthday by what he thought was a ghost coming up from the basement (he just saw moon-kwang's husband coming into the kitchen from the basement stairs). moon-kwang's husband is tied up by ki-taek and he reveals to him that he has been trying to communicate with mr park via morse code for several years (a light in the dining room has a switch in the basement) (but mr park, never understood morse code and hence never understood the message). after a few close calls, the other three kims leave the mansion undetected. they run back to their apartment, which has been flooded by the storm. they salvage what they can, ki-woo carrying the large \"lucky rock\" min-hyuk gifted his family earlier. the three, along with other displaced citizens, sleep in a gymnasium. meanwhile, moon-kwang dies from her concussion as geun-sae cries. but before dying she cuts off the tape that ki-taek had used to tie her husband up, thus freeing him. the following day, mrs. park throws a birthday party for da-song (jung hyun-joon) and ask the kims to come over and help with all the chores (the kims are bummed as they feel that the parks are totally oblivious to the lives of ordinary people. ki-taek is especially miffed when mrs and mr park, both make insensitive comments about air quality improving from all the rain from the previous night). during the party, ki-woo carries the rock down to the bunker, intending to kill geun-sae. geun-sae ambushes ki-woo, cracks his head open with the rock, then crashes the party, where he stabs ki-jeong in the chest.\ngeun-sae's sudden appearance triggers da-song's traumatic memory, causing the child to have a seizure. ki-taek rushes to stop ki-jeong's bleeding, while mr. park yells at him for the car keys, so park can drive da-song to the hospital. the key lands under the fighting choong-sook and geun-sae, before choong-sook kills geun-sae with a meat skewer. mr. park retrieves the key, while recoiling from geun-sae's \"poor man's smell.\" ki-taek, witnessing mr. park's reaction to the smell, also his own, snaps, fatally stabs him, then flees. the ending is narrated by ki-woo, recounting that ki-jeong died from her wounds, while he required brain surgery and suffered a weeks-long coma; he and choong-sook went to trial and were sentenced to probation. later, watching the parks' mansion, ki-woo notices a light flickering in morse code - a message from ki-taek, who managed to retreat into the bunker in the chaos, and has been hiding from and living off of the new owners. ki-woo promises that one day, he will earn enough money to buy the house and free his father. fantasizing about the day of their reunion, ki-woo ends his letter sitting in the shabby semi-basement apartment where the movie began."

      "the kims - mother and father chung-sook and ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son ki-woo and daughter ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of seoul. ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. despite not having that university education, ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to park da-hye, who min plans to date once he returns to seoul and she herself is in university. the parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect namgoong. while mr. and mrs. park are all about status, mrs. park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which min tells ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. in getting the job, ki-woo further learns that mrs. park is looking for an art therapist for the parks' adolescent son, da-song, ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \"jessica\", really ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four kims. in ki-woo also falling for da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the kims as a collective start a plan for all the kims, like ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. the most difficult to get rid of may be moon-gwang, the parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the parks themselves. the question then becomes how far the kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the parks.",
      "jobless, penniless, and utterly hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch ki-taek and his equally unambitious family struggle to make ends meet by working for peanuts in their dingy, basement-level apartment. however, their luck changes when their college-age son, ki-woo, seizes a golden opportunity: entirely unqualified, he has the nerve to pose as an english tutor for the wealthy park family's teenage daughter. and now, the sky is the limit. but as they adopt a winner-take-all strategy and launch a silent class war, the question arises. when it comes to parasites, how does one get rid of them?",
      "after his rich friend asks him to fake qualifications and take his tutor role to a rich teenage girl so none will try to date her in his absence, the poor lead takes up the offer & enters the rich yet gullible family. he then cons his way into the family, dates his friend's crush & schemes to get all his family get a job under the family. when the owners leave the house on vacation they move in & undergo a bizarre encounter which changes the lives of everyone.",
      "the kim family, living in poverty, infiltrates the wealthy park household by securing jobs under false pretenses. initially enjoying comfort and manipulation, tensions rise as hidden secrets, class disparities, and greed surface, culminating in violence. the film examines social inequality, ambition, and moral ambiguity, blending dark comedy, suspense, and tragedy. its narrative explores human desire, deception, and the consequences of systemic inequity, ultimately presenting a critique of modern society and the disparity between wealth and poverty."

        "text": "&quot;Get Out&quot; takes the initial premise of &quot;Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner&quot; and then twists it with &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; to create a compelling, thoughtful critique of white power. Peele, of course, isn&#39;t arguing that white people are out to hypnotise black people. Instead, Get Out is a stinging criticism of the white liberalism that carries itself as empathetic towards blacks, but that empathy only extends as far as white control. Peele isn&#39;t taking aim at Neo- Nazis and other whites who would angrily shout the n-word. They&#39;re a lost cause. Instead, he&#39;s looking at those who profess their lack of racism, but only do so if they can maintain their dominance over black people in the most insidious manner possible. As Chris pointedly notes to Rose at party full of white people, &quot;Has anyone here ever met a black person that didn&#39;t work for them?&quot;<br/><br/>The film is genuinely creepy. Instead of cheesy music and grotesque torture porn, Peele relies on the unknown to draw you in. What is happening here? The plot builds like a slow boil to a terror explosion. Clues to the outcome are evident from the first second, but it takes the entire run-time to pull everything together. It&#39;s such a joy to be surprised by a horror outcome. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a genre film this inventive since Cabin in the Woods. The resolve is truly satisfying.<br/><br/>My favourite aspect of Get Out is the intelligence of the characters. There&#39;s a lot to like, but beyond the deeper themes; the characters aren&#39;t morons. I cringe every time I watch a genre film and the characters don&#39;t behave logically. Chris and Rose are not fools. Something is amiss, enough to warrant wariness. Anyone in this situation would be unnerved as events play out. Credit again to Peele for writing characters that act rationally.<br/><br/>&quot;Get Out&quot; doesn&#39;t replace the scares with humour – Peele is too smart to do that. Instead, he balances the fear with laughs and then laces everything with social comment and that unsettling tone. The fact that Chris is so eminently likable just underlines it. It all adds up to something of a treat – for everybody, not just horror fans."

        "text": "I&#39;ll say right off the bat, I didn&#39;t really know who Jordan Peele was coming into this movie. I knew he had a show with Keegan-Michael Key and was a comedian of sorts. What I didn&#39;t know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out. <br/><br/>Get Out surprised me for a number of reasons. The first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that It truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can&#39;t quite figure out what it is.<br/><br/>And secondly this was the work of a first time director. It&#39;s rare that you get a movie written and directed by the same person on their first attempt and they manage to hit it out of the park. <br/><br/>And lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn&#39;t just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It&#39;s refreshing to see this done with such care.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect movie? No it isn&#39;t, but it&#39;s damn good especially if you&#39;re in the mood for a good psychological thriller with horror overtones."

This is NOT a film that tries to make the viewer feel &quot;sorry&quot; for black people, nor is it at all preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting. I&#39;m an old white guy by the way.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, while mostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, making it the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat). It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and acting is honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best films of the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!"

Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.<br/><br/>High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching &#39;Get Out&#39;. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, &#39;Get Out&#39; is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.<br/><br/>It&#39;s an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread. <br/><br/>That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It&#39;s nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film&#39;s combative themes. <br/><br/>Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. &#39;Get Out&#39; benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though &#39;The Shape of Water&#39; and especially &#39;Lady Bird&#39; were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively. <br/><br/>Despite how it sounds, &#39;Get Out&#39; struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still. <br/><br/>While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya&#39;s superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most. <br/><br/>My only complaint of &#39;Get Out&#39; is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that&#39;s it note. <br/><br/>Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it&#39;s a great film that is among the year&#39;s better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves."

        "text": "I was totally blown away by &quot;Get Out&quot;. This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn&#39;t conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited &quot;fish out of the water&quot; type of settings where it&#39;s up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. &quot;Get out&quot; will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick."

He wrote and directed this smart, elegant film and even made us find a new way to classify it. Horror, comedy, drama, social satire. What matters really is that it&#39;s a first of sorts and then some. It introduced me also to a major talent in front of the camera. Daniel Kaluuya is sheer perfection. As an actor he projects and provokes empathy. Whatever your race or races you will be in his shoes, feeling what he&#39;s feeling. I was him, throughout. The gasps of fear mixed with the bursts of laughter from the audience - me included - made Get Out one of the most rewarding film experiences of 2017. Kudos also to Bradley Whitford and the phenomenal Catherine Keener. They are terrifyingly recognizable and what about Caleb Landry Jones? Menacing enough and comic enough - he reminded me of Peter, Chris Elliott&#39;s character in Everybody Loves Raymond - to be all the things he needed to be. Perfect. As is the human relief provided by the wonderful Marcus Henderson. As you may gather I&#39;m celebrating. So, Mr Peele, thank you very much."

        "text": "Get Out Directed by Jordan Peele is a horror film which begins with quite a unique story, surrounding an African American man meeting his girlfriend&#39;s Caucasian family. The first two acts of the film contain scenes which build so much tension. The start of this movie had me so invested due to how much was unknown. I really built strong curiosity surrounding why things seemed very off. All the performances were great, particularly the main character who was incredibly convincing with all his emotion. Also the cinematography was very nice, containing scenes which are one long take with no cuts. As for negatives there are quite a few. The tone of this film is very messy. I wished the horror really got under my skin. Although it was as if there were constant intermissions with cliche comedic relief. To me this broke all the tension, and really made me question the type of film I was watching. There are also quite a few plot holes, and scenes which really don&#39;t have any purpose besides trying to freak out the audience. Once the film reaches the third act, I was really let down by the direction they took. I was expecting a smart and unique revelation. But all I got was a standard messed up horror movie &quot;twist&quot;. I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket. I really thought this movie would be insanely smart, but honestly it&#39;s really not that special. It didn&#39;t impact me the way other great horror and thriller films have. It&#39;s a solid and enjoyable film. But it&#39;s far from groundbreaking, so therefore I give Get Out a 6. I feel like many will disagree with my rating. If you think you can convince me as to why it is great go ahead. One thing I still don&#39;t see is why African Americans were targeted in the film. When it was asked the question was just brushed off..."

        "text": "I think it was watching The Last Blair Witch film that I first saw the trailer for this, and while I enjoyed that film, leaving the Cinema it was my memories of Get Out that I left with, I&#39;m so often disappointed by films, having seen wonderful looking trailers, finally a movie that kills of that thinking.<br/><br/>Get out ranks as the Cinematic triumph of the year for me, the film was creepy, poignant, amusing, and I think highlighted the racial problems that still exist, in certain places.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya is an actor, that sadly I&#39;ve not paid a huge amount of attention too, I kept asking where do I know him from, a friend pointed out that as a fan of Psychoville I should have known. Kaluuya was outstanding, and I&#39;ll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on, hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints, she provided the scene of the film for me, the therapy session, providing a moment of sheer terror.<br/><br/>Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy, but the satire was definitely apparent. I can&#39;t wait to pick up the blu-ray and enjoy it again. I know the ending was changed, I&#39;m assuming with the possibility of a second, I hope they don&#39;t, this film deserved to be left alone as a true success.<br/><br/>Brilliant, 10/10"

        "text": "As you may guess from the submission date, I&#39;m reviewing &quot;Get Out&quot; several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to. <br/><br/>This is not to say that it&#39;s not good. Jordan Peele directs well, but it&#39;s his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture. There is such depth to it the screenplay, not only with its allegories and metaphors, but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings. There are many layers to be &quot;unpeeled&quot; (pun intended) on repeat viewings. <br/><br/>The other strength is Daniel Kaluuya. A regular face on UK TV for a while now and with a few smaller roles in Hollywood productions, Kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a career-making performance. <br/><br/>So, what doesn&#39;t work as well? Essentially, it&#39;s the films third act. I try to write my reviews without spoilers and I will here, but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it. It&#39;s an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally. Also, Chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory, given that there&#39;s been nothing to justify that, save some talk about Judo lessons. <br/><br/>Provided you&#39;re not anticipating horror in the traditional sense, &quot;Get Out&quot; is a smart genre mingling effort. Not perfect, but certainly not bad for a debut film."

      "plot_summary": "Photographer Chris Washington flies to the Armitage family estate with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage to meet her parents, neurosurgeon Dean Armitage and psychiatrist/hypnotherapist Missy Armitage, and brother Jeremy. On the drive upstate they hit a deer; a police officer questions Chris despite not driving, which Rose later frames as racial profiling. At the Armitage house Chris notices odd behavior from the Black housekeeper Georgina and groundskeeper Walter, and the family makes uncomfortable remarks about Black people and athletic figures. Missy persuades Chris to undergo hypnotherapy to stop smoking; under hypnosis he relives his mother's hit-and-run death and sinks into Missy’s “sunken place,” a dissociative trance she uses as a control technique. Georgina unplugs Chris’s phone overnight. The Armitages host an annual garden party attended by wealthy white guests who fetishize Black bodies; Chris meets blind art dealer Jim Hudson and a nervous Black man who calls himself Logan King. Chris learns from his friend Rod Williams that “Logan” is actually Andre, a missing man from Brooklyn. Chris covertly photographs Andre; the flash triggers a panicked seizure. Later Chris finds old photos showing Rose with other Black partners, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her claim he’s her first Black boyfriend.\n\nWhen Chris decides to leave, Rose refuses to give him the keys; Jeremy blocks the door. Missy hypnotizes Chris again and sends him to the sunken place, then Chris awakens bound to a surgical chair in a basement operating room. The family reveals their true operation: Dean and an inner circle perform neurosurgical transplants that transfer the minds of wealthy white clients (including Rose’s grandfather Roman) into the bodies of young Black people while the original consciousness is imprisoned in the sunken place. Jim Hudson explains he wants Chris’s eyes and artistic vision; Rose’s role is to lure Black partners. Rod, suspicious, goes to the police but is dismissed.\n\nAs staff prepare Chris for surgery, he plugs his ears to resist Missy’s trigger and fights back. He seizes Jeremy, bludgeons him, and during a struggle kills Dean (who falls and ignites a fire) and Missy. He finishes Jeremy after Jeremy ambushes him. Chris flees in Jeremy’s Porsche but strikes Georgina—who secretly houses Rose’s grandmother Marianne’s mind; she attacks and dies in the crash. Rose and Walter (whose body houses Roman’s mind) pursue Chris. Chris uses his phone flash to briefly free Walter from Roman’s control; Walter shoots Rose and then fatally shoots himself. Chris, unable to kill Rose, surrenders when a police car approaches—only to discover the car is driven by Rod, who had tracked and rescued him.",

      "on a suburban street at night, an african american man walks alone, talking on the phone. a car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, the man starts to walk away. a person wearing a helmet, tackles and subdues the man, drags him into the car, and drives away. photographer chris washington (daniel kaluuya) reluctantly agrees to meet the family of his white girlfriend rose armitage (allison williams), unsure of a warm reception as they do not know that he is african american, and he does not want to shock them with his sudden appearance. chris is in excellent physical condition, is young and has an incredible skill of taking breathtaking photographs.\nrose assures chris that her parents are not racists. during their drive to the family's countryside estate, they hit a deer and report the incident. the white policeman asks for chris's identification even though he was not driving, but rose intervenes, and the encounter goes unrecorded. chris was more than happy to share his id with the policeman, but rose was indignant and alleged that chris was being profiled for being an african american while he had nothing to do with the deer incident. the policeman eventually relents and backs off. at the house, rose's white parents, neurosurgeon dean (bradley whitford) and psychiatrist/hypnotherapist missy (catherine keener), and her brother jeremy (caleb landry jones) make discomfiting comments about african american people. chris and rose had been dating for 4 months. dean's father was defeated by jesse owens in the trials for the berlin olympics. dean adds that he loved obama as a president and would have loved to see him get a third term.\nthe house is completed secluded, and the nearest neighbor is across a lake adjoining the property. jeremy shares embarrassing stories about rose at dinner. chris also observes eerie, unnatural behavior from the family's african american servants, georgina and walter. dean calls out the cliche of a white family having african american servants in the house to make light of the observation.\nchris shares that he never met his dad and his mother passed away when he was 11, so he has no family that looks out for him. chris notices that the african american workers at the estate are uncannily compliant. unable to sleep, chris goes outside to smoke and sees groundskeeper walter running from the woods. missy catches chris returning and talks him into a hypnotherapy session to cure his smoking addiction, using the noise of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger. in a trance, he recounts the death of his mother in a hit-and-run when he was a child, about which he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. he sinks into a void missy calls the \"sunken place\" where his body becomes temporarily paralyzed. he awakens believing he had a nightmare but realizes cigarettes now revolt him. the african american housekeeper georgina (betty gabriel) unplugs his phone, draining his battery. dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the armitages' annual get-together. they take an interest in chris, admiring his physique or expressing admiration for african american figures such as tiger woods. chris meets a blind art dealer, jim hudson, who takes an interest in his photography. chris meets logan king (lakeith stanfield), an african american man who also acts strangely, and who is married to a much older white woman. chris calls his friend, african american tsa officer rod williams (lil rel howery), about the hypnosis and the strange behavior at the house. when chris attempts to stealthily photograph logan, the camera flash causes logan to become hysterical, rushing at chris and frantically lashing out for him to \"get out\". logan is taken away by dean, who later claims logan had a seizure. away from the house, chris persuades rose to leave with him, while dean holds an auction with a picture of chris on display. chris sends logan's photo to rod, who recognizes him as andre, a missing man from brooklyn. while packing to leave, chris finds photos of rose in prior relationships with african american people, including walter and georgina, contradicting her claim that he is the first african american person she has dated. chris tries to leave, but rose refuses to give him the car keys. jeremy blocks the door and missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send chris back to the sunken place. chris awakens strapped to a chair. a video presentation featuring rose's grandfather roman (richard herd) explains that the family transplants the brains of white people into african american bodies. the consciousness of the host remains in the \"sunken place\", watching but powerless. jim hudson (stephen root), a blind art dealer says transplanting their brains into africa american people is the latest \"fad\", but clarifies that he does not care about chris's race and that he only wants chris's eyesight and his artistic talents. meanwhile, rod, who has been trying to contact chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they do not believe his theory about the armitages. missy attempts to hypnotize chris again, but chris plugs his ears with stuffing pulled from the chair, blocking the hypnotic commands. when jeremy comes to collect him for the surgery, chris bludgeons jeremy and then kills dean (who falls and accidentally sets fire to the room) and missy when she attacks him, before finishing off jeremy when he attacks again. chris tries to escape in jeremy's porsche but accidentally hits georgina, who has the brain of rose's grandmother, marianne. compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he picks her up, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and kill her. rose and walter, who has the brain of rose's grandfather, roman, arrive to capture chris. during a scuffle, chris uses his phone's flash to briefly free walter from roman's control. walter takes rose's rifle, shoots her, and fatally shoots himself. chris starts strangling rose, but cannot bring himself to kill her. a police car arrives and chris surrenders, but it's revealed to be rod. he picks up chris, leaving rose bleeding on the road."

      "a young african-american photographer by the name of chris washington is dragged out to his girlfriend's parents' house to spend the weekend and meet the family. chris feels unwelcome, considering there are only three other african-americans on the farm, and two of them work on it. as the weekend progresses, chris starts noticing some weird things around the farm and when he snaps a picture of one of the family members, the man freaks out. the sense of uneasiness is in the air and it continues to grow as chris finds out the strange truth of what is really going on in this place."

        "summary": "American Psycho is not a story about murder",
        "text": "The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality.\nPeople are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he&#39;s trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Feynman&#39;s real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despair<br/><br/>It&#39;s about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society. Bateman&#39;s interpretation of the world is skewed by his inflated ego and his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses. Bateman is a killer, but still, he&#39;s not the killer he thinks he is, as he goes insane he can&#39;t distinguish reality from fantasy. His over the top chainsaw massacre style killings may be an aestheticized elaboration on partial truths, ultimately the film doesn&#39;t care. The more significant point of the movies absurdity is that within his society Batemans not the psycho at all he&#39;s just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality, secretly discontented American psychos. Bateman is surrounded by like-minded superficial people obsessed with all the wrong things like making impossible reservations at Dorsia and the tasteful thickness of their business cards. Within the homogenized upper-class elite identities blur as everyone strives after a generic yet highly specific image of success.<br/><br/>Everyone we see in Bateman&#39;s company appears to be the same person. It&#39;s no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously and swapped throughout the film. The lawyer has mistaken Paul Allen or perhaps Batman has killed the wrong person becomes not only plausible but also an expression of the general confusion resulting from the loss of individual identity.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, although Batman tries like the rest to fit in, the emptiness of his lifestyle also fuels a craving to stand out. To escape the conformity that he on some level despises Batman leads a second life as a killer, where he&#39;s unfettered from the bounds of society. Although he actually wants to be seen as a murderer as someone different from the rest of society Bateman is denied even the satisfaction by every self-absorbed yuppie he meets. When he&#39;s seen stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, the witness is only interested in the bag.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue."

Still not sure about whether or not all of the things happening were all in his head. I guess that&#39;s up for anyone&#39;s interpretation of the story.

        "text": "In 1991, Bret Easton Ellis&#39; controversial novel &quot;American Psycho&quot; took the world by storm - women accused it of being misogynist, sexist filth and others were understandably shaken by its brutal and graphic depictions of unprovoked violence and torture.<br/><br/>Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders &quot;twenty, maybe forty people.&quot; It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time.<br/><br/>In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it&#39;s confessing to manslaughter over the phone (&quot;I just had to kill a lot of people!&quot;) or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News&#39; &quot;Fore&quot; album before hitting an associate over the head with an axe.<br/><br/>Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal - he&#39;s a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he&#39;s a monster - complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is an attack on the absurdities of the &#39;80s yuppie era - sometimes the satire isn&#39;t very subtle, in fact it&#39;s often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong - and it is. Whether it&#39;s business men drooling over each other&#39;s fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, &quot;American Psycho&quot; hits strong and hard - this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle - it never was.<br/><br/>The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot;; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein.<br/><br/>Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale&#39;s performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co-starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home - he&#39;s the reason it&#39;s worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.<br/><br/>Since its release, many critics have accused &quot;American Psycho&quot; of being a watered-down version of the book, being both &quot;politically correct&quot; and &quot;lacking satire.&quot; However, I don&#39;t recall the last time I saw a man beat a dog to death with the heel of his shoe in a mainstream motion picture. Or chase after a prostitute completely naked, wielding a bloodied chainsaw. Or hold a gun to a cat&#39;s head and threaten to feed it to an ATM machine.<br/><br/>In fact, when &quot;American Psycho&quot; was previewed before the Motion Picture Association of America, they gave it an NC-17 rating - not for its violence, as one might expect, but rather for its threesome scene between Patrick and two prostitutes.<br/><br/>Director Mary Harron cut footage from the film and finally managed to achieve an R-rating, but on a new &quot;Uncut Killer Collector&#39;s Edition&quot; DVD, you can see the film as it was intended to be seen - and it&#39;s a real fine treat. Now excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes."

All of the yuppies dress the same, act the same, have the same job position (vice president), and have the same haircuts, which is why everyone always confused Patrick with someone else. Additionally, the satire was to show that everyone at the time was extremely narcissistic and superficial. The landlord of the apartment cleaned up all of the bodies and gore that Bateman left behind in order to protect the property value. The point is that Bateman is an actual psychopath who lives in a society that&#39;s somehow even more crazy than he is."

I got the impression that it was all a sham, that none of them were actually Vice Presidents of Pierce and Pierce, and that they were actually role playing the position of executives in anticipation of an eventual promotion. Bateman himself never seemed to do any work, other than having his secretary line up his appointments to meet associates or clients so he could spend additional time not working some more.<br/><br/>The bigger tip off that this was possibly all just an imaginary story was the &#39;Feed me a stray cat&#39; scene. By this time it was pretty well established that Bateman was unhinged, but the question is, to what degree. Did he really engage in those prior killing sprees or did he just imagine it? Or a third possibility, was he envisioning what it would be like to go completely berserk if all bets were off and he could completely get away with it. By the time the story&#39;s over, I think you&#39;d have to be open to all these various interpretations, because in the &#39;real&#39; world, you wouldn&#39;t have a realtor showing an apartment where bodies hung in the closet just days before.<br/><br/>Going in, I had some trepidation when the DVD opened to a menu screen suggesting a splatter flick, and if I&#39;m not mistaken, an image of a chain saw somewhere along the way. I&#39;ve seen a couple of slasher/gore films in my time, and though I&#39;m not that squeamish (any more), that kind of stuff does nothing for me. So anticipating a chain saw scene, I could only groan at the impossibility of the physics involved in poor Jean (Chloe Sevigny) taking a direct bull&#39;s eye hit like that at the bottom of the staircase. Just one more suggestion that this wasn&#39;t really happening.<br/><br/>And what of Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe)? What happened to him? Was this Bateman&#39;s guilt becoming manifest, either because of an actual murder or because of his own malicious thoughts? Generally I get really upset about movies like this because they tamper with one&#39;s ability to follow a coherent story and come to a reliable conclusion about what happened in it. But then again, it&#39;s got the word &#39;Psycho&#39; in the title, so I guess all bets are off. Personally, twenty five dollars for a couple of drinks at a trendy New York City night club is about as psycho as I&#39;ll ever get."

        "text": "Without a doubt the most underrated movie of the past decade, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is a piece of American cinema that shouldn&#39;t be missed by anyone, regardless if they do not like the violence (which does have its reasons).<br/><br/>\nChristian Bale gives a flawless performance as the troubled, deep down wannabe Yuppie who has psychotic, violent impulses. This is true acting here, folks. Not phoned in Tom Crooze acting. Some people object to Patrick Bateman narrating the movie [always a weak sign in a movie] and not letting us figure his motives out on our own, but if you watch closely, Bale shows us Bateman&#39;s vulnerablity through every minute of every day of his life. The movie is at times hysterical, as his character uses dominant Alpha Monkey behavior around the opposite sex. But again, it&#39;s all for good reason.<br/><br/>\nIf not for Bale&#39;s performance, see it for the knife twisting satire of the &#39;80&#39;s -- from the clothes, to the hairdos, to the music [I&#39;ll never be able to hear Phil Collins in the same way again!] The production value is rich in &#39;80&#39;s nostalgia from the &quot;Black and White&quot; set designs to the enormous cellphones [how could we forget those?].<br/><br/>This is a movie that major studios are too afraid to touch. This is film making. Remember film making? When films took you on a ride in someone&#39;s life and you would walk away with a piece of their mind? American Psycho doesn&#39;t have any real morals or answers, but it shows the deep psychological insecurities some men suffer everyday. Oh yeah, and it was directed by a woman, so all you feminists shut up!"

A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in &quot;Little Women&quot;. Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don&#39;t feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable. His rough sex with two women while he rides one of them looking at himself in the mirror is one of the most disturbing film moments I&#39;ve ever seen. I wonder if Bale will ever be able to play goodness, convincingly."

By killing your opponents. By eating your sexual partners. By destroying everyone around you.<br/><br/>&#39;American Psycho&#39; retains the balance between this psychotic state, a chilling thriller and a very funny movie.<br/><br/>The scenes that show Patrick playing music for his guests are absolutely hilarious, as he comments very seriously on records by artists such as Whitney Houston, Phil Collins and Huey Lewis &amp; the News. The funny thing is that he chooses the most commercial or sold out records of these artists, to explain how much better they are compared to their previous, more artistic work. Another message of the state of the receivers of commercial art.<br/><br/>You can analyze &#39;American Psycho&#39; for hours. It can be perceived both as a deep and a fun movie.

        "text": "Having just finished American Psycho, I came to IMDB to get some clarification on the ending. And it seems I&#39;m not the only one left vaguely adrift by the ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve browsed some of your comments, not all 400+ to be sure. But some of them. A good sampling I think, and this movie has three distinct cheering sections.<br/><br/>Those who consider it a masterpiece, those who consider it unredeemable, boring trash, and by far the largest segment, those who see it as a flawed masterpiece.<br/><br/>I fall into the latter category. And no, I did not read the book. But as others have stated any movie that requires you to read the book, to &quot;get&quot; the movie, is ultimately a failure as a movie.<br/><br/>So my review is based solely on the merits of the film. And contrary to what some have said, the film does have many merits. I found it brilliantly directed, and a superbly acted examination of excess, and boredom, and evil. An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking.<br/><br/>\nEven before seeing the ending, I thought how much bateman lives in people. Found myself thinking, an examination of bateman is an examination of men by the name of Reagan and Bush. How American Psycho is an examination of our times, and our modern theologies.<br/><br/>I found the movie as a whole riveting, loved the restraint shown (and disagree with those calling for more gore, I think Mary should be applauded for her deft hand, the scenes have more power for what is not shown), and was captivated by nearly every scene, by scenes others have called boring, but I found profound.<br/><br/>Bateman putting on his makeup, or simply trying to get a restaurant, and the near apocalyptic importance, such minutiae makes in the lives of empty men. The right card, or the right cloth, or the right table, or the right watch, how these are the signposts of an empty age and an empty soul, and how these things have more value than your fellow man... or woman.<br/><br/>Bateman attains everything the materialistic times tells him he should want, but once he gets it he feels nothing. Emptier than before, less than before. It&#39;s only in the extremes of his addictions he begins to feel something, anything. He feeds to fill the emptiness, but the more he feeds the emptier he gets. He eats at his fellowman (woman) but in his bloodlust he eats at himself.<br/><br/>He is the American dream, taken to its cannibalistic extremes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And never before has makeup, played such a mesmerizing part in a movie. Bateman&#39;s(Chris Bale&#39;s) face at times when he is under stress, takes on a plastic look, a glossy, sweaty sheen, and for all the world it looks like he&#39;s wearing a mask... and the mask, his mask of sanity, is beginning to run.<br/><br/>Simply amazing use of makeup. And incredible performance by the lead actor. I wasn&#39;t familiar with him before this, but everyone will be after this.<br/><br/>Upon first hearing about this movie, I had no desire to see it. I&#39;ve grown up since the age of Hills Have Eyes and trash like The Beyond, watching people suffer no longer seems significant. I guess as we get older we ask more of our art than springer, or the WWF, or slasher flicks. We ask of our art to tell us something true. Something of ourselves, and our world.<br/><br/>I think American Psycho under the deft hand of Mary Harron becomes more than my prejudices, and exceeds my expectations. Rises at times to dizzying heights not unlike art.<br/><br/>Mary&#39;s restraint makes this movie. But I fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well. The ending is too ambiguous. Who is Bateman in the end. Is there a Bateman? And what did he do or did not do?<br/><br/>In the end,the movie will nag at you. Did he or didn&#39;t he? And in the end, now that I write this I&#39;m thinking maybe the answer doesn&#39;t really matter, maybe in the end the answer is the same. In the end a sin of thought, or a sin of action, is still a sin. In the end we are left with a man, and a nation... whose mask is slipping.<br/><br/>\nI think like the first Psycho, time will prove this one.... worthy. I now add Mary Harron to the small selection of modern directors I will tiptoe through broken glass to see. Directors like Dave Fincher(Seven, Fight Club), Carl Franklin(Devil in a Blue Dress), Johnny To(Expect the Unexpected), Ringo Lam(Full Alert, Victim), M. Night Shyamalan(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), and Peter Weir(Fearless).<br/><br/>Recommended."

      "plot_summary": "In 1987 New York City, 27-year-old investment banker Patrick Bateman maintains a meticulous daily grooming routine and social life among wealthy Wall Street colleagues while hiding violent urges. Engaged to Evelyn, Bateman has an affair with Courtney and despises coworkers like Paul Allen. After becoming enraged by Paul Allen's superior business card, Bateman murders a homeless man and the man's dog, then later gets Paul drunk, brings him to his Manhattan apartment, and kills him with an axe while playing Huey Lewis's \"Hip to Be Square.\" Bateman stages Paul's apartment to suggest Paul fled to London. Private detective Donald Kimball interviews Bateman about Paul's disappearance. Bateman lures two prostitutes, Christie and Sabrina, to his apartment, introduces himself as Paul Allen, tortures and injures them, and later has sex with Christie and Elizabeth in Paul's apartment before killing Elizabeth; Christie flees, discovers multiple female corpses, and is chased and killed when Bateman drops a chainsaw down the stairwell. Bateman repeatedly attempts and sometimes follows through on murders: he tries to kill coworker Luis Carruthers in a restaurant restroom but flees when Luis misreads the attack as a sexual advance; he murders a model; he holds a nail gun to his secretary Jean's head when she visits his apartment and then asks her to leave. Bateman breaks off his engagement to Evelyn. Wandering the city, Bateman encounters a stray kitten at an ATM, is seen trying to shoot it, shoots a woman who intervenes, then engages in a gunfight with arriving police, destroying patrol cars and killing officers before fleeing into office buildings. In the wrong building he murders a security guard and a janitor, then calls his lawyer Harold and leaves a lengthy, explicit confession on Harold's answering machine, falsely identifying himself as Paul Allen in other interactions. The next day Bateman returns to Paul's apartment expecting gore, but finds it clean and for sale; his colleagues treat Paul as if he is alive (Harold says he had dinner with Paul in London). Jean discovers Bateman's journal drawings of murders and sexual violence. Bateman meets his lawyer and friends at lunch and tries to extract accountability, but his confession is dismissed as a joke or mistaken identity. Realizing his crimes go unpunished and may never be believed, Bateman concludes in voice-over that his confession \"has meant nothing,\" leaving his violent double life unresolved.",

      "in 1987, wealthy new york investment banker patrick bateman's (christian bale) life revolves around dining at trendy restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fiance evelyn (reese witherspoon) and for his circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of whom he dislikes. bateman describes the material accouterments of his lifestyle, including his daily morning exercise and beautification routine. he also discusses his music collection, with performers such as huey lewis and the news, phil collins, and whitney houston. his focus on a lavish lifestyle is also evident by his taste in expensive designer clothing and his luxurious apartment.\nbateman is having an affair with evelyn' friend courtney (samantha mathis), while evelyn is having an affair with bateman's coworker timothy (justin theroux). courtney is engaged to bateman's other colleague luis carruthers (who is slightly gay). bateman and his associates flaunt their business cards in a display of vanity. enraged by the superiority of co-worker paul allen's (jared leto) card, bateman murders a homeless man and kills the man's dog. at a christmas party, bateman makes plans to have dinner with paul, with paul mistaking bateman for another coworker, marcus halberstram (anthony lemke). bateman gets paul drunk and lures him back to his apartment. while playing \"hip to be square\" on the stereo, explaining to paul his opinion and interpretation of the song, bateman murders paul with an ax, donning a raincoat moments before, to keep blood off of his clothes. he disposes of paul's body, then goes to paul's apartment to stage the situation so that others believe paul has run off to london. bateman is later interviewed about paul's disappearance in his office by private detective donald kimball (willem dafoe), hired by paul's family. during the night, bateman takes two prostitutes, whom he names christie (cara seymour) and sabrina (krista sutton), to his apartment and explains to them the improvement he saw in the band genesis after they moved away from progressive rock toward a more pop rock sound beginning with the album duke. after they have sex, bateman tells them to stay, while taking out instruments he uses for torture. in the next scene, the prostitutes leave his apartment bruised and bloodied. in the entire sequence, bateman makes sure that he introduces himself as paul allen. the next day, bateman's colleague luis carruthers (matt ross) reveals his new business card. bateman tries to kill luis in the restroom of an expensive restaurant but cannot bring himself to strangle him. luis mistakes the attempted murder for a sexual advance and declares his love for bateman, who flees in disgust. after murdering a model, bateman invites his secretary, jean (chloë sevigny), to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks beforehand. when jean arrives, bateman, unbeknownst to her, holds a nail gun to the back of her head while the two converse. when he receives an answering machine message from his fiance, he asks jean to leave. kimball meets bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion. bateman has a threesome with his friend elizabeth (guinevere turner) and christie at paul's apartment. bateman kills elizabeth during sex, and christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses as she searches for an exit. she is chased by a naked bateman wielding a chainsaw, and as she is running down the stairs of paul's apartment building, is killed by the chainsaw which bateman drops from several levels above her. bateman breaks off his engagement with evelyn. that night, as he uses an atm, he finds a stray kitten; the atm displays the text \"feed me a stray cat\". as he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman sees him and tries to stop him; he shoots her and lets the cat go free. a police chase ensues, but bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks. fleeing to his office, bateman enters the wrong office building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. in an office he believes to be his, bateman calls his lawyer harold (stephen bogaert) and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on harold's answering machine. the following morning, bateman visits paul's apartment, expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation, but it is vacant and for sale. the real estate broker tells him to leave. as bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch, a horrified jean finds detailed drawings of murder, mutilation, and sexual assault in bateman's office journal. bateman sees harold at a restaurant and tries to convince him that he is a serial killer relating to the phone message he left the other night. harold mistakes bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke, saying he had dinner with paul in london days earlier. a confused bateman returns to his friends and in a final voice-over narration, he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves, that there has been no catharsis: \"this confession has meant nothing\"."

        "summary": "We should actually talk about the Fight Club",
        "text": "Fight Club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. The nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. From the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraying how consumerism moves the world, but is unable to give relief in the end. Flipping through catalogues of new furniture for his apartment is the narrator&#39;s only personality trait. To fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. By lying to people, pretending he has conditions he does not have, the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. The emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. David Fincher makes a subtle, yet clear, comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. The system doesn&#39;t care about anyone, the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. However, when the narrator is finds someone who&#39;s a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - &quot; Her lie reflected my lie. Suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn&#39;t cry, so once again I couldn&#39;t sleep&quot;.<br/><br/>Shortly after Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is introduced into the story, the main character loses everything he valued. Deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is. If the narrator is a worker who&#39;s way too worried about his condo and his job, Tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldn&#39;t care less about all those things. The contrast between them is clear; Tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading - &quot;Right. We are consumers. We&#39;re the by-products of a lifestyle obsession.&quot; The characters portrayed here are so different because one of them is free, while the other is not. Tyler, in a nihilistic way, helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough - something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world - that all they can do is giving up everything. The self-destruction promoted by the Fight Club is ironically what allows the narrator - as well as many other frustrated men - to find solace in their mundane life. Little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job, about behavior and the value of things. It&#39;s interesting to note that the narrator doesn&#39;t quit his job immediately, picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system - he eventually does though.<br/><br/>Many subtopics are discussed through the movie. We see the narrator and Tyler, now living together, talking about many things. They talk about how both had an absent father, how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense - &quot;He says, &#39;get a job&#39;. So, I&#39;m 25, I call again and say, &#39;now what?&#39; He says, &#39;I dunno. Get married&quot;. The nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment we&#39;re born, while both of them agree on that, they also agree that this is all a great waste of time. It&#39;s important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people, especially with women as Tyler comments - &quot;We&#39;re a generation of men raised by women. I&#39;m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need&quot;.<br/><br/>As the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life - &quot;Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don&#39;t need&quot;. Tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club; everyone is much more like the narrator, but they&#39;re striving to be more like him. At some point, Tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger - what he would call Project Mayhem. While the original Fight Club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom, through self-destruction, to its members, Project Mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system. The frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back - &quot;We&#39;ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we&#39;d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won&#39;t. And we&#39;re slowly learning that fact. And we&#39;re very, very pi**ed off&quot;. However, the narrator starts to slowly go against what Tyler was meaning to do - kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society - and when this happen it&#39;s the moment the movie reaches its climax.<br/><br/>The genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that Tyler Durden and the narrator are the same person, they have always been the same person. Due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life, he created an alter-ego - someone capable of manifesting everything he wasn&#39;t as a system abiding person. The contrast created by Tyler&#39;s different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds; and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about Tyler Durden is even more marvelous. This movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence - when you become just a number, just a braindead member of society, having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored. In the end Tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions can&#39;t be reverted - so he only stands by and watches. The final scene is beautiful; what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while &quot;Where is my Mind&quot; plays? This movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is - in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden. It is provocative, funny and thrilling and most importantly: It is so damn real. The plot aged perfectly and I don&#39;t think it is going to get old so soon - this movie is a must watch."

Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces.

      "plot_summary": "An unnamed narrator (Edward Norton), an insomniac cost–benefit analyst for an automobile company, cannot sleep and follows his doctor's advice to attend late-night support groups for terminally ill patients to provoke emotional catharsis. At a testicular cancer support group he bonds with Robert \"Bob\" Paulson and sleeps; he then cycles through other groups, faking illnesses to get the same release. His routine collapses when he spots another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence prevents him from crying and restores his insomnia. On a business flight home he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman. The narrator returns to find his condominium destroyed by an explosion; with nowhere else to go he calls Tyler and, after an awkward meeting in a bar, moves into Tyler's decaying house on the condition that he hit Tyler. The pair fist-fight for release; their parking-lot brawl draws a crowd and they formalize a men-only bare-knuckle fight club in the bar basement with strict rules (never talk about Fight Club, only two to a fight, etc.). The narrator uses Fight Club to regain a feeling of control; Tyler exploits it to teach men to embrace pain and reject consumer culture. Tyler also runs small, subversive businesses—making soap from human fat, splicing porn into films at a theater, urinating in soup at a luxury hotel—and seduces Marla, who overdoses and is rescued by Tyler, beginning an affair. Under Tyler's leadership Fight Club evolves into Project Mayhem, a hierarchical, paramilitary anti-capitalist organization that recruits members from fight clubs nationwide to perform acts of vandalism and escalating sabotage. The narrator is increasingly sidelined as Tyler orchestrates more extreme missions (the mistreatment and eventual death of a Project Mayhem member, internal discipline, and urban terrorism). After Tyler disappears for periods, the narrator tries to shut down the project; traveling the country he discovers fight clubs and Project Mayhem cells in many cities and hears members call him \"Tyler Durden.\" A visit to Marla and a series of clues lead to the revelation that Tyler is the narrator's alternate personality—Tyler controls the narrator's body when the narrator is dissociated or asleep, embodying traits the narrator lacks. Confronting this realization, the narrator attempts to stop Tyler's plan: Project Mayhem has wired explosives to the support columns of several major credit-card company high-rises. With the police compromised by Project Mayhem membership, the narrator breaks into one target building and tries to find a way to abort the demolition. He confronts Tyler and, after a struggle in which he perceives Tyler as separate, the narrator puts a gun in his mouth and fires, shooting through his cheek; the wound collapses Tyler's visualized presence. Immobilized but lucid, the narrator frees himself, finds Marla—who has been kidnapped and brought to him—and holds her as Project Mayhem detonates the explosives. From a high window they watch the simultaneous collapse of the targeted financial buildings and the city block as the film ends.",

      "the narrator (edward norton) is an automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform product recall cost appraisals. his job is to assess if the cost of recall for the cars would be higher or lower than the cost of payouts on claims against product failure in the field. this decides whether a recall is initiated.\nhis apartment is an advertisement for the ikea catalog. his doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia (he hadn't been able to sleep for 6 months) and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. by attending the group, the narrator feels distraught at the condition of these ill-fated people and breaks down. he meets robert \"bob\" paulson (meat loaf) who cries endlessly and hugs the narrator for emotional support. the narrator also cried in bob's arms.\nhe is then able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups in order to release his pent-up emotions and get a good cry which helped him sleep. the narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, marla singer (helena bonham carter), at the same meetings and his insomnia returns. the narrator knew that marla had no diseases and was probably attending the support group meetings for the same reasons as him. the narrator could not cry as he felt that his lie was caught.\nhe arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees. during a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets tyler durden (brad pitt), who is a soap salesman. tyler says that one can make all kinds of explosive using simple household items. the narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion, which is assessed to be a possible gas leak. the narrator calls marla but does not speak to her, and then calls tyler as he had his phone number from the flight.\nhe calls tyler and meets him at a bar. tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. the narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar.\ntyler works as a night shift projectionist at a movie theater splices single shot of pornographic films into regular family films being screened at the theater. he also works as a waiter at the pressman hotel, where he urinates into the soup and performs other degenerate acts on food items served to rich customers. the narrator moves into tyler's dilapidated house (the windows were boarded up, the stairs were about to collapse and there was no lock on the front door) and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the parking lot. after attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement.\nthe rules of the fight club include stuff like never talk about fight club, no shirt no shoes, a fight goes on for as long as it needs to, only 2 to a fight, one fight at a time, if you are new to fight club you have to fight and so on. marla contacts the narrator at his new phone number and wants to know why he hasn't been attending his support groups. the narrator says that he found a new one. that night the narrator has a dream about having sex with marla. but then he finds marla in the house, who just had sex with tyler. the narrator has no clue how marla got there and that confuses her, and she leaves in a huff. turns out marla had overdosed on xanax; she was rescued by tyler (the narrator had left the phone on the table while marla was talking and tyler picked it up and went to her room) and the two embark upon a sexual relationship. tyler makes the narrator promise never to talk about him with marla. under tyler's leadership, the fight club becomes \"project mayhem,\" which commits increasingly destructive acts of anti-capitalist vandalism in the city. the fight clubs become a network for a new underground organization, project mayhem, and the narrator is left out of tyler's activities with the project. after an argument, tyler disappears from the narrator's life and when a member of project mayhem dies on a mission, the narrator attempts to shut down the project. tracing tyler's steps, he travels around the country to find that fight clubs have been started in every major city, where one of the participants identifies the narrator as tyler durden. a phone call to marla confirms his identity and he realizes that tyler is the alter ego of his own split personality. tyler appears before him and explains that he controls the narrator's body whenever he is asleep and represents the narrator's basest urges: he is physically fit, assertive, aggressive, has a strong sexual prowess and is \"free in all the ways\" the narrator isn't. the narrator, overcome with the epiphany, faints and tyler disappears. the narrator awakes to find tyler has made several phone calls during his blackout and traces his plans to the downtown headquarters of several major credit card companies, which tyler intends to destroy in order to cripple the financial networks. tyler and the demolitions squad of project mayhem had wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.\nfailing to find help with the police, many of whom are members of project mayhem, the narrator attempts to disarm the explosives in the basement of one of the buildings. he is confronted by tyler, knocked unconscious after a lengthy fight, and taken to the upper floor of another building to witness the impending destruction. the narrator, held by tyler at gunpoint, realizes that, in sharing the same body with tyler, he is the one who is actually holding the gun. he fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. the illusion of tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head. shortly after, members of project mayhem bring a kidnapped marla to the narrator and leave them alone. the bombs detonate and, holding hands, the two witness the destruction of the entire financial city block through the windows."

      "a young man leads a pretty humdrum life assessing car crashes to determine if his automobile company should issue recalls to fix problems. he also suffers from insomnia and takes to attending group therapy sessions for people who have survived various diseases. there he meets marla who like him attends these sessions though she is neither a victim nor a survivor. his life changes when he meets tyler durden on a flight home. tyler seems to be everything that he's not and together they create a men-only group for bare-knuckle fighting. it soon becomes all the rage with fight clubs springing up across the country and the group itself becoming an anti-capitalist domestic terrorist organization. tyler and marla develop a relationship leaving him often on the outside of what is going on. he soon finds that the group is out of control and after a major self-revelation decides there is only one way out.",

      "too weak to cope with his dysfunctional existence, a disillusioned insomniac poses as a victim in late-night support groups for terminally ill patients. but everything changes when tyler durden steps into his mundane life. a rebellious spirit, tyler is an anarchist philosopher destined to become the unpredictable spark in the apathetic office worker's existence--a confident guide on the journey of self-discovery. as the feeble pencil-pusher discovers the gritty world of fight club, an underground sanctuary where men gather to free themselves from the constraints of a cruel modern reality, he finally sees that there is pleasure in pain. and what once felt like mere survival morphs into a thrilling revolution. now transformed into an urban warrior, the newcomer can challenge his demons and the society that confines him. after all, in this chaotic world, aren't violence and freedom two sides of the same coin?"

        "text": "If you&#39;re a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as &#39;Titanic-mania&#39; during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.<br/><br/>In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it&#39;s enjoyable and fun even if you&#39;re a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner&#39;s soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.<br/><br/>My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that &#39;Titanic sucks&#39;, is to give it a chance. You&#39;re sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well."

        "text": "I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. &quot;It was so great,&quot; she said. &quot;You really felt like you were on the ship.&quot; &quot;Nonsense,&quot; I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, &quot;you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she&#39;ll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.&quot; &quot;Well, maybe,&quot; thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. &quot;OK,&quot; I thought, &quot;I&#39;ll give it a look see.&quot; I didn&#39;t want to like it - and I didn&#39;t. I loved it! What a great movie.<br/><br/>Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost &quot;you are there&quot; type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don&#39;t just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet&#39;s being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect &quot;t&quot; I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose&#39;s mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I&#39;m no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion&#39;s performance of &quot;My Heart Goes On.&quot;<br/><br/>Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don&#39;t accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he&#39;s been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.<br/><br/>A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.<br/><br/>9/10."

I&#39;m a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. <br/><br/>We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being &quot;unsinkable&quot; - tease the audience, almost to the point where you&#39;re like &#39;is it really going to sink?&#39;<br/><br/>I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he&#39;s going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose&#39;s life, knowing she&#39;s fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.<br/><br/>Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7."

Also, there&#39;s no question that when the boat sinks, it&#39;s terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue.

He is an embodiment of freedom.<br/><br/>So it makes a lot of sense that they fall in love.<br/><br/>Their relationships evolve as the tragedy happens.

They recover Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley's safe but find only a nude sketch dated April 14, 1912. A 101-year-old woman, Rose Dawson Calvert, contacts Lovett and identifies herself as the woman in the sketch. She visits with her granddaughter Lizzy and recounts her memories. In 1912, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater boards Titanic in Southampton with her mother Ruth DeWitt Bukater and fiancé Cal Hockley; Ruth presses the match to resolve the family's financial woes. Jack Dawson and his friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets in a poker game and board at the last minute. Distressed by her engagement and feeling trapped, Rose climbs the stern to commit suicide but is saved by Jack. Cal invites Jack to dine with first-class passengers; Jack endures class snubs but later takes Rose to the third-class party where they dance. Rose and Jack grow closer despite Cal and Ruth's objections. Cal gifts Rose the Heart of the Ocean. Rose asks Jack to draw her nude wearing the necklace in her stateroom; she gives the drawing to Jack for safekeeping. That night, Titanic strikes an iceberg. Ship designer Thomas Andrews and officers assess five flooded compartments and conclude the ship will sink within hours. The crew launches lifeboats, many launched under capacity and with preferential treatment for first-class passengers; third-class passengers are delayed and some locked below. Cal finds Jack's drawing and, to frame Jack, slips the Heart into Jack's coat and has Jack arrested and handcuffed. Rose frees Jack as the ship fills. Cal persuades Rose to board a lifeboat but watches as she jumps back to the ship to stay with Jack. Cal fires a pistol in pursuit, then uses deception to secure a lifeboat. Titanic's stern rises, the ship breaks in two, and many passengers plunge into the freezing Atlantic. Jack and Rose cling to wreckage; Jack helps Rose onto a floating debris panel that cannot support both of them. Fifth Officer Harold Lowe rescues Rose; Jack dies of hypothermia in the water. Survivors are picked up by RMS Carpathia and taken to New York. Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson to hide from Cal. Lovett's simulated reconstruction and Rose's account confirm the sinking's timeline and Cal's attempt to save his reputation by claiming the diamond stolen. Back in 1996, Rose finishes her story aboard Lovett's vessel, goes alone to the stern at night, and drops the Heart of the Ocean into the sea above Titanic's wreck. The film closes with Rose's life montage showing she lived freely, followed by a vision/reunion of young Rose and Jack at Titanic's grand staircase among the dead.",

      "in 1996, aboard the research vessel akademik mstislav keldysh, treasure hunter brock lovett (bill paxton) and his team explore the wreck of rms titanic, searching for a valuable diamond necklace called the heart of the ocean. the wreck rests on the ocean floor, 3821 meters below the surface.\nthey recover caledon \"cal\" hockley's (billy zane) safe, believing the necklace to be inside, but only find a sketch of a nude woman wearing the diamond, dated april 14, 1912, the night the titanic hit the iceberg. the expedition is privately funded and hence brock is under pressure to deliver the diamond to his investors.\nhearing about the drawing on the tv news, an elderly woman named rose dawson calvert (gloria stuart) calls lovett and claims that she is the woman depicted in the drawing. she and her granddaughter, lizzy calvert (suzy amis), visit him and his team on his salvage ship. rose is 101 years old and all the details about her convince brock that she was on the ship on the night of its accident. she was the last person who wore the heart of the ocean.\nbrock knows that cal's father nathan had settled an insurance claim for the loss of the diamond, that cal had bought for his fiance, just before the titanic sailed from england. brock takes rose through a quick simulation of the titanic iceberg collision. it hit the berg on the starboard side, which punched holes across a wide section of the hull. the water entered several water-tight compartments and eventually rose over the bulkheads (which did not go above the e deck) to spill over to the other water-tight compartments astern. the ship tilts as the stern rises out of the water and eventually splits into 2 parts right down the middle. the front section goes under first, followed shortly by the stern section. the ship sinks at 2:20 am, 2 hours and 40 minutes after the ship hit the iceberg.\nwhen asked if she knows the whereabouts of the necklace, rose recalls her time aboard the titanic, revealing that she is rose dewitt bukater, a passenger believed to have died in the sinking. she then begins her story as follows:\nin 1912, 17-year-old first class passenger rose (kate winslet) boards \"titanic\" in southampton with her fiance cal and her mother ruth dewitt bukater (frances fisher). titanic is making her first voyage and is considered to be \"unsinkable\".\nruth stresses the importance of rose's engagement, as the marriage would solve the dewitt bukaters' secret financial problems. meanwhile, jack and his italian friend fabrizio (danny nucci) board the titanic at the last possible minute by winning 3rd class tickets for the voyage in a poker game against irish immigrants.\nmargaret \"molly\" brown (kathy bates) boarded the ship at cherbourg. molly was looked down upon by the other first-class passengers for being \"new\" money.\nthe next day, titanic sails west at 21 knots. the titanic is captained by edward john smith (bernard hill) and was designed by thomas andrews (victor garber). edward's staff includes chief officer henry wilde (mark lindsay chapman), first officer william murdoch (ewan stewart), second officer charles lightoller (jonathan phillips) and third officer herbert pitman (kevin de la noy).\nj bruce ismay (jonathan hyde) is the md of the white star line, the owners of the titanic. distraught by her engagement, rose considers suicide by jumping off the ship's stern. rose climbs over the astern rails as she decides whether to jump. a drifter and artist named jack dawson (leonardo dicaprio) stops her and pulls her back on deck when she slips and hangs off the rails. discovered with jack on the stern, rose tells cal that she was looking over the ship's edge in curiosity and that jack saved her from falling.\nat rose's insistence, cal invites jack to dinner the following night to show his appreciation. that night cal gifts rose the heart of the ocean diamond, in a necklace.\nismay orders edwards to light the last 4 boilers of the titanic and speed the ship up, even though there were reports of icebergs on their route. ismay wanted to showcase the speed of the ship by arriving ahead of time in new york.\nrose notices that the ship is carrying only enough lifeboats for half the passengers on the ship. andrews says that an extra row of lifeboats would make the ship look cluttered and hence he was overruled. jack and rose develop a tentative friendship (and she learns that jack is a professional painter who specializes in painting nudes), even though cal and ruth are wary of the young third-class man. following the first-class dinner that night, rose secretly joins jack at a party in the ship's third-class quarter. they engage in some irish tap dancing and jack shows rose a mighty good time, where she gets to enjoy a hearty laugh for the first time in her life. cal and ruth forbid her to see jack (cal even hits rose when she attempts to stand up for herself), and rose attempts to rebuff jack's continuing advances. she soon realizes, though, that she prefers him over cal, and meets him at the bow of the ship during what turns out to be the titanic's final moments of daylight.\nthey then go to rose's stateroom, where she asks jack to sketch her while naked and wearing the heart of the ocean, cal's engagement present to her. afterward, the two evade cal's bodyguard spicer lovejoy (david warner) and make love inside a car in the ship's cargo hold.\ngoing afterwards to the ship's forward well deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg. due to the calm seas, the iceberg was detected very late, and then it took long for the ship to change direction to avoid collision. as a result, instead of hitting the berg head on (which would have been better for survival), the ship grazes the berg on its starboard side, and punches holes across the hull. the first officer closes all the watertight doors that go up to deck e.\njack and rose overhear the ship's officers and designer outline its seriousness. rose tells jack that they should warn her mother and cal.\nandrews says that 5 compartments of the ship are punctured (which is one compartment more punctured than what the ship was designed to stay afloat), which means the ship will sink. the ship has 2 hours at the most according to andrews. the ship has 2200 souls on board. the captain issues a distress call by the radio at their current coordinates. the nearest ship is 4 hours away. cal discovers jack's drawing and a mocking note from rose in his safe along with the necklace. cal reports the diamond stolen. furious, cal has his bodyguard slip the necklace into jack's coat pocket. accused of stealing it, jack is arrested, taken down to the master-at-arms' office and handcuffed to a pipe. cal puts the necklace in his coat. rose runs away from cal and her mother (who has boarded a lifeboat) and releases jack. the ship then starts to launch flares in order to attract any nearby ships.\nthe third-class passengers are not allowed on to the lifeboat decks and are locked below. meanwhile, lifeboats are launched half empty with only first-class passengers. once jack and rose reach the deck, cal and jack persuade her to board another lifeboat, cal claiming that he has arranged for himself and jack to get off safely. after she boards, cal tells jack that the arrangement is only for himself. as rose's boat lowers, she realizes that she cannot leave jack, and jumps back on board the titanic to reunite with him.\ninfuriated, cal takes a pistol and chases them into the flooding first-class dining saloon. after exhausting his ammunition, cal realizes to his chagrin that he gave his coat with the diamond to rose. with the situation now dire, he returns to the boat deck and boards a lifeboat by pretending to look after a lost child.\nthe engineers of the titanic are credited with keeping the lights on till the last possible moment. the musicians of the titanic were a septet orchestra who performed chamber music in the first-class section aboard the ship. the group is noted for playing music, intending to calm the passengers for as long as they possibly could, during the ship's sinking. jack and rose return to the top deck. all lifeboats have departed, and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. the ship breaks in half, and the stern side rises 90-degrees into the air. as it sinks, jack and rose ride the stern into the ocean. jack helps rose onto a wall panel only able to support one person's weight. holding the panel's edge, he assures her she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. meanwhile, fifth officer harold lowe has commandeered a lifeboat to search for survivors. he saves rose but is unable to reach jack before he dies from hypothermia. rose and the other survivors are taken by the rms carpathia to new york, where rose gives her name as rose dawson. she hides from cal on carpathia's deck as he searches for her. she learns later that he committed suicide after losing his fortune in the wall street crash of 1929. her story complete, rose goes alone to the stern of lovett's ship. there she takes out the heart of the ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the ocean.\nwhile seemingly asleep in her bed, the photos on her dresser are a visual chronicle that she lived a free life inspired by jack. the young rose is then seen reuniting with jack at the grand staircase of the rms titanic, applauded and congratulated by those who perished on the ship."

That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don&#39;t like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there&#39;s no hope... I just love this movie.

        "text": "I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.<br/><br/>I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.<br/><br/>The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don&#39;t grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys&#39; tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.<br/><br/>I feel that much of Gumps&#39; appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.<br/><br/>The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest&#39;s character terms it very well with this quote,&quot;I think it is a little bit of both.&quot; From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"

        "text": "&quot;I&#39;ve made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good&quot;-Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that&#39;s what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.<br/><br/>We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there&#39;s nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn&#39;t have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel&#39;s voice &quot;You can sit here if you want&quot;. Jenny, Forrest&#39;s best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea&#39;s and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that&#39;s &quot;always kissing and touching her and her sisters&quot;. Forrest just assumes that it&#39;s a father&#39;s love since he doesn&#39;t have a dad that could show him that it&#39;s wrong.<br/><br/>Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest &quot;Run, Forrest! Run!&quot;. He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.<br/><br/>Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won&#39;t stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest&#39;s army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there&#39;s Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can&#39;t blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn&#39;t really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.<br/><br/>This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It&#39;s not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.<br/><br/>10/10"

Bambi&#39;s mother, I couldn&#39;t care less. Jimmy Stewart in, &quot;Oh, what a wonderful life,&quot; - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.<br/><br/>But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.<br/><br/>I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you&#39;ll see."

Like others, I&#39;ve seen this movie more than once. One comment I&#39;ve never heard is that Forrest&#39;s simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author&#39;s intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you&#39;re supposed to do and believe in God and you&#39;ll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn&#39;t have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There&#39;s a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it&#39;s a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."

He&#39;s given many great performances over the years, this has always stood out.<br/><br/>Forest sees Vietnam, the moon landings, presidential changes, and experiences a tough childhood and army life, all relayed from a public bench.<br/><br/>It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s moving, it&#39;s wonderfully quirky. I have always loved the way they placed him into historical footage, that scene with John Lennon a personal favourite. It&#39;s a long film, but it&#39;s one that simply flies by.<br/><br/>The music is fabulous throughout, some of the best, and most memorable songs of the time, you&#39;ll hear the likes of The Mamas and Papas, Scott McKenzie and many more, it&#39;s a terrific soundtrack.<br/><br/>I saw it aged 14 when it was first released, and maybe didn&#39;t appreciate it at the time, now though, I think it&#39;s a captivating watch.<br/><br/>Keep on running Forest.<br/><br/>10/10."

        "text": "Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn&#39;t been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don&#39;t judge it; you live it. I know he&#39;s a film character. It doesn&#39;t matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn&#39;t complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don&#39;t ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. <br/><br/>The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten."

        "text": "I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump&#39;s travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us."

Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny&#39;s wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.<br/><br/>Forrest states the obvious, &quot;Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!&quot;<br/><br/>And the water-works just started to flow.<br/><br/>I sit up straight and clear my throat.

I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It&#39;s filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can&#39;t deliver, I drop my keys.

        "summary": "The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...",
        "text": "... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn&#39;t really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he&#39;s told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He&#39;s told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he&#39;s taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he&#39;ll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.<br/><br/>Gump&#39;s childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn&#39;t have Forrest&#39;s childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or &quot;destiny&quot; as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn&#39;t help but play a role in the decisions she made. <br/><br/>Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us &quot;You can&#39;t do that! What are the odds! You&#39;ll fail! Make the safe choice!&quot; To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn&#39;t understand it."

      "plot_summary": "In 1981 Savannah, Georgia, Forrest Gump sits on a bus stop bench and begins recounting his life. He is born and raised in Greenbow, Alabama by his mother (Mrs. Gump), who runs a boarding house and teaches him self-respect. As a child Forrest (IQ 75) wears leg braces; on the school bus he meets Jenny Curran, his lifelong friend and love. Bullies chase Forrest; Jenny tells him to run, his braces break and he discovers he can run extremely fast. Forrest earns a football scholarship to the University of Alabama, plays under Coach Bear Bryant, returns a book to Vivian Malone during Governor George Wallace’s “schoolhouse door” incident, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House.\n\nAfter college (1967) Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army. He befriends Private Benjamin “Bubba” Blue, who teaches him about shrimping, and Lieutenant Dan Taylor, the platoon leader descended from soldiers who died in U.S. wars. In Vietnam Forrest writes to Jenny but she doesn’t reply; during an ambush Bubba is killed and Forrest carries several wounded soldiers, including Lt. Dan, to safety. Forrest is shot in the buttocks, receives the Medal of Honor from President Lyndon B. Johnson, and is discharged. Lt. Dan loses his legs and initially resents Forrest for saving him.\n\nWhile recovering at a VA hospital Forrest learns ping-pong and becomes a national ping-pong celebrity, travels to China with the U.S. team (ping-pong diplomacy), appears on television with John Lennon, and meets President Richard Nixon. Forrest inadvertently witnesses suspicious activity at the Watergate complex when staying there with the ping-pong team. Returning to Greenbow, Forrest uses endorsement money to buy a shrimp boat in Bayou La Batre to honor Bubba’s dream. He starts the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company; after Hurricane Carmen their fleet prospers. Lt. Dan, who joined Forrest as first mate, recuperates emotionally and financially when he invests Forrest’s profits in Apple stock; Forrest gives half the earnings to Bubba’s family.\n\nForrest’s mother dies of cancer in 1974. He periodically reunites with Jenny, who pursues a self-destructive life of drugs and abuse. In 1972 Jenny briefly rekindles with Forrest at an anti-war rally; she later leaves. In 1976 Jenny returns; Forrest proposes, they sleep together, and she tells him she loves him but leaves the next morning. Devastated, Forrest runs across America for three years, becoming a cultural phenomenon, then stops and returns to Greenbow.\n\nIn 1981 Forrest receives a letter from Jenny asking him to visit. He reunites with her; she has a young son named Forrest Jr., whom she reveals is Forrest’s child. Jenny is ill (implied hepatitis C); they marry and move back to Greenbow. Jenny dies about a year later. The film ends with Forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school and waiting at the bus stop to finish his story.",

      "in 1981, at a bus stop in savannah, georgia, a man named forrest gump (tom hanks) recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench. forrest offers them chocolates from a box and says that his mother used to say, \"life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get\". in 1951, in greenbow, alabama, young forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine and is unable to walk properly, even though he had very strong legs.\nforrest gump was named after nathan bedford forrest, a confederate general and the first grand wizard of the ku klux klan. forrest's mother named him after this ancestor, possibly to remind him that \"sometimes we all do things that just don't make no sense\".\nforrest's mother instills a sense of pride in him and is adamant not to let anyone tell forrest that they are better than him. he lives alone with his mother (sally field), who runs a boarding house out of their home (which was a large estate that had been in their family for several generations) that attracts many tenants, including a young elvis presley (peter dobson), who plays the guitar for forrest and incorporates forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. on his first day of school, forrest meets a girl named jenny curran (robin wright) on the bus. jenny offered her a seat when nobody else would, and the two become best friends. they were together all the time. jenny helped forrest and taught him how to read. forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. at an early age he is deemed to have a below-average iq of 75. forrest is denied admission in the normal school and his mother sleeps with the school principal (sam anderson) to make sure he is not sent to the gifted school. jenny encourages forrest to run when he encounters bullies in the field. while fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing forrest to be a very fast runner. jenny's mother passed away when she was 5. it is implied that jenny is being sexually assaulted as a kid by her father. she is eventually removed from his custody and given to her grandmother. forrest's talent in running fast eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the university of alabama in 1963, where he is coached by bear bryant (sonny shroyer). he witnesses governor george wallace's stand in the schoolhouse door (when he was protesting the federal order to allow african american kids at the university). at the same protest, forrest returns a dropped book to vivian malone jones (one of the first african american students to be allowed into the university). forrest becomes a top kick returner, is named on the all-american team, and meets president john f. kennedy at the white house.\njenny studies at a girls' only college and forrest unknowingly interferes with her life when he beats up her lovers who try to take advantage of her. jenny tells forrest that he would not be around always to protect her. jenny takes forrest to her room and gets him to touch her breasts, due to which he ejaculates prematurely. after graduating college in 1967, forrest enlists into the u.s. army. during basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed \"bubba\" (mykelti williamson), who convinces forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. bubba family had been catching and serving shrimp for several generations and knew everything about the business.\njenny is expelled from college after her topless photos make it to playboy. because of the spread, she gets a job singing topless in a memphis bar. forrest goes to meet her and tells her that he loves her. jenny says that forrest doesn't know what love is and tells forrest to stay away from her. in 1968, bubba and forrest are sent to vietnam, serving with the 9th infantry division in the mekong delta region. after months of routine operations, forrest learns the value of good personal hygiene and to change socks every chance they get. forrest got to see a lot of the countryside on his patrols, and he was confused that they were always looking for this guy named charlie. there was always someplace to go and forrest was asked to check out a lot of fox holes used by the enemy to hide. it rained a lot for 4 straight months. forrest saw every kind of rain there is, stinging rain, big old fat rain, rain that came from the side and even rain that seemed to come from the ground up. forrest wrote a lot of letters to jenny, but she never replied. their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and bubba is killed in action. forrest saves several wounded platoon mates-including his lieutenant, dan taylor (gary sinise). forrest carries the wounded men from the battle zone on his back and to safety. dan resisted but forrest carried him away regardless. dan is forrest and bubba blue's platoon leader during the vietnam war, whose ancestors have died in every u.s. war and who regards it as his destiny to do the same.\ndan loses both his legs-and is awarded the medal of honor for his heroism by president lyndon b. johnson. during the rescues, gump was hit in the buttocks by a bullet that jumped up. he was sent back stateside for r&r. he gets to eat a lot of ice cream. lt dan is recovering right next to gump but hates him for saving his life. while at the hospital, gump is introduced to ping pong. at the anti-war \"march on the pentagon\" rally, forrest meets a man who \"had an american flag for a shirt\" and briefly reunites with jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. gump hits men who mistreat jenny. he gives her his medal of honor, as he got it for doing what she told her to do. he also develops a talent for ping-pong and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside john lennon on the dick cavett show. forrest spends the holidays and the 1972 new year in new york city with lieutenant dan, who has become bitter due to the loss of his legs. forrest soon meets president richard nixon (as part of the us ping pong team) and is put up in the watergate complex, where he accidentally witnesses and reports some men with flashlights in the building across the street that's keeping him awake (alluding to the watergate scandal). forrest is eventually discharged from the army. returning to greenbow, forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles (for $25k). he uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in bayou la batre, fulfilling his promise to bubba. lieutenant dan joins forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. after their boat becomes the only one to survive hurricane carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the bubba gump shrimp company, after which lieutenant dan finally thanks forrest for saving his life. lieutenant dan invests into what forrest thinks is \"some kind of fruit company\" (apple) and the two become millionaires, but forrest also gives half of the earnings to bubba's family. forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of cancer. in 1976, jenny-in the middle of recovering from years of drugs and abuse-returns to visit forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. that night she tells forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. heartbroken, forrest goes running and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again. he eventually decides that he's grown tired of running (metaphorically and physically) and returns home to greenbow. back in 1981, forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from jenny, who asked him to visit her. as forrest is finally reunited with jenny, she introduces him to their son, named forrest gump, jr. jenny tells forrest she is sick with an unknown disease implied to be hepatitis c and the three move back to greenbow. jenny and forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. the film ends with forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school."

      "forrest gump is a simple man with a low i.q. but good intentions. he is running through childhood with his best and only friend jenny. his 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. forrest joins the army for service in vietnam, finding new friends called dan and bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. however, this is all irrelevant to forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart jenny curran, who has messed up her life. although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.",
      "the movie forrest gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. gump faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. from wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average iq and even being shot, gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. while several less than ideal things occur during gump's life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. this skill allows gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability. while gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend jenny curran. the movie is centered on forrest gump and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of jenny and how important she is to him. although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. this upsets gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other's lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the reflection pond in d.c. even though gump is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of curran and the hardships she faces.",
      "slow-witted forrest gump has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother, he leads anything but a restricted life. whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. but one person forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled jenny.",
      "forrest gump, an innocent and kind-hearted alabama boy, has been dealing with other people's unkindness nearly all his life. having grown up with beautiful jenny, his only friend, forrest yearns to learn all about the ways of the world and embarks on a mission to find his true purpose in life. thrust into downright extraordinary situations, forrest finds himself present at some of the most pivotal events in the second half of the 20th century, rubbing shoulders with influential and historical figures, including john f. kennedy , richard nixon , a nice young man from england named john lennon , and even a handsome but still unknown elvis presley . throughout his existence, forrest has been encountering life's randomness; however, in this earth, no one is insignificant. with his presence alone, one builds his own place in this world, unknowingly changing the flow of things, while fate floats like a feather in the wind. but, in this life-altering journey, is forrest meant to find his destiny, and be with jenny?"

And that one path isn&#39;t necessarily better or worse than another, just different. And that you&#39;ll never know what was behind the doors you didn&#39;t choose, and that anyway time will eventually smooth over the regret you feel at not choosing them instead. Except that it doesn&#39;t always, and you may never stop completely regretting the life you think you might have had, even if you don&#39;t really mind the life you do have.<br/><br/>This movie is that song. It&#39;s watching a beautifully defined female character convince herself and her husband that her life is what she wants it to be, and that she doesn&#39;t wish she&#39;d taken a chance on the childhood sweetheart who comes back into her life after years apart and with whom she has off the charts chemistry. The actors who play the sweethearts as adults, Greta Lee and Teo Yoo, are both exceptional, but it&#39;s Lee who creates the most fascinating character. A bit cold, a bit distant, not always even completely likable in a way that&#39;s hard to define, a bit casually cruel to her husband who by anything the movie shows us can&#39;t be judged as anything other than a good, solid, and super understanding guy. But then there&#39;s that last scene that took my breath away, when we see the resolve not to feel emotions that would be inconvenient to feel give way, and we realize just how much has been roiling underneath the surface of Lee&#39;s character all along. It&#39;s magnificent and earned its right to leave me a quivering mess.<br/><br/>The movie is also a sensitive look at what it feels like to be an immigrant, torn between two cultures, and not sure whether the nostalgia you feel is what you really want or just the allure of the familiar.<br/><br/>A really great bit of counterprogramming in a summer that seems to be dishing up nothing but Marvel movies.<br/><br/>Grade: A."

        "text": "Celine Song, in her directorial debut, makes a film whose story has little to do with the usual &quot;movies.&quot; Past Lives is true, it is not the usual love story. It is not the usual movie love story. But it is more, because it is real, because it is true, because it is drawn from the living experience of the director. And in one way in the other, all of our lives are movies, only thanks to cinema we have the power to give a different development or ending to those stories. Instead, Song chose, bravely, to be true to what seemingly seems like a &quot;trivial&quot; love story of two people who are separated as children and meet again after 20 years by choice and not by chance. Two people who in the generality of their life stories, look at each other, scrutinize each other and love each other. It is a story made of silences, from which the thoughts of the two protagonists arise and arrive. It is a story made of glances and behind those glances are all the unspoken words, all those emotions that words would not render. Past Lives works because it is not what one expects from a film love story. It is real life."

I know that&#39;s vague, but I didn&#39;t want to spoil anything, but maybe once you&#39;ve seen it you&#39;ll know what I mean. It was all handled so beautifully and had such heartbreakingly sincere human experiences. I think it&#39;s safe to say that in the end, we have no effing idea what we are doing and how it will turn out, but we just hope it&#39;s the right decision in the moment."

It has everything you want from a good movie: a cute romance, philosophy to guide the narrative, characters that feel real even if you don&#39;t get to see what they do (in his case) or barely see anything (in her case). It&#39;s as if the scriptwriters managed to weave a touching romance out of snippets, without it feeling like you&#39;re watching something unfinished.<br/><br/>There&#39;s this one scene where they show how time passes. I loved the cinematography behind that. Simple yet rewarding visually.<br/><br/>From this movie I learned that you should accept love and realise that you don&#39;t have to give up what you have for what you could have. You can accept both those feelings of love inside of you and even if it hurts, it&#39;s what I believe makes the soul feel alive."

I liked how it acknowledged the random little things in our lives that all have to add up in a certain way for us to end up with our partner in life, things in retrospect which are kind of mind-boggling, but at the same time, gave a certain nod to the idea of fate, the Buddhist &quot;in-yun&quot; concept of meeting someone again and again in our reincarnations until it reaches the threshold that allows for marriage. The characters were beautifully drawn and didn&#39;t devolve into cliches, an example of which was the husband who gave a master class in being understanding and supportive. Beautiful cinematography too. Definitely one to see."

And that masterpiece is Past Lives.<br/><br/>Song&#39;s dialogue is understated to the point of risking not creating a connection with the characters. It would not have worked with sub-par actors. But the risk payed off big time-all of these actors are wonderful, allowing their body language and line delivery fill in the gaps with their characters&#39; true psychology.<br/><br/>A simple plot becomes a richly complex story of lost love, sought closure, and found purpose; and it&#39;s all due to Celine Song having the proper understanding of when to allow silence to speak.<br/><br/>Yet despite the frequent bouts of silence, not a moment feels wasted. Every shot and sentence is meticulously edited to give us exactly what we need to feel each moment with its full emotional power.<br/><br/>This very well may be the best film of 2023.

The theme is the path, perhaps the theme of the time jumps and the fact that so much happens between one and the other will take you a little off. Beyond that, it is impressive that it is Celine Song&#39;s first work. As for the performances, I am far in favor of the character of the husband, very mature and deconstructed, with perhaps the best dialogues and development of the film. The last two scenes, both in the restaurant and the farewell, are by far a delight. Highly recommended."

She displays a range of emotion from tears you can feel to the somber, dry expressions many show when they simply don&#39;t know how to express their feelings.<br/><br/>This film moves fast even though its pace is slow. The dialog shifting languages keeps your attention and creates the beautiful cultural connection needed to make this story of an immigrant and the man who stayed behind work. The way this story builds Greta&#39;s life in NY at the moment you believe they&#39;re finally going to connect... god this movie got me.<br/><br/>I was blown away by this movie.

Na-young’s family prepares to emigrate to Canada; on the night before they leave she asks Hae-sung to wait for her, and he promises. At age twelve she boards the plane and they lose daily contact. Years later Na-young, now using the name Nora, lives in New York, has become a successful playwright, and is married to Arthur, an American. Hae-sung stays in Korea, studies engineering, completes mandatory military service, and works in Seoul; he keeps sporadic contact with Nora by video chat and email through their late teens and twenties. Their conversations are intimate and frequently nostalgic but noncommittal.\n\nWhen Hae-sung travels to New York in his early thirties, Nora arranges to meet him with Arthur. The three meet in a bar and then spend time together in Nora and Arthur’s apartment. Hae-sung and Nora reconnect quickly: they revisit shared memories, walk through neighborhoods, and spend long one-on-one conversations about choices and what might have been. Hae-sung reveals he left a stable life to travel and has unresolved feelings; Nora is candid that she loves Arthur but is unsettled by how easily she slips into intimacy with Hae-sung. Arthur notices the closeness and feels like an outsider; he alternates between warmth and guarded jealousy. Over several days Nora and Hae-sung test boundaries—kissing twice and sharing a night together where they talk through their adolescent vows and current lives, but neither pursues a full affair nor immediately leaves Arthur.\n\nBack in Seoul after the visit, Hae-sung decides to move to New York to be near Nora; he takes the risk of emigrating and finds work. Nora faces mounting guilt and confusion; she tells Arthur the truth about her emotional infidelity and her physical intimacy with Hae-sung. Arthur reacts with pain but also with pragmatic attempts to preserve their marriage. Nora and Arthur attempt couples therapy, and Nora informs Hae-sung she cannot break her marriage lightly; she needs to know if his decision to move is permanent. Hae-sung, committed to following Nora, rents an apartment and plans to build a life close by.\n\nMonths later, Nora and Hae-sung meet one last time in New York to confront whether to pursue a life together. Nora ultimately chooses to stay with Arthur for the stability and history of their marriage; she declines to reopen her life to the uncertainty of leaving. Hae-sung, disappointed but resolute, accepts her decision and begins to rebuild his own life independently. The film closes with each character moving forward separately: Nora remaining with Arthur while carrying the memory of what might have been, and Hae-sung starting anew in New York, honoring the past connection but relinquishing the expectation of a romantic future together.",

        "text": "Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way &quot;The Pianst&quot; did. The last movie that did that was &quot;Casino&quot;. I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I&#39;ll start watching and I&#39;ll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn&#39;t stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;, I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.<br/><br/>I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn&#39;t enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody&#39;s performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you&#39;re the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn&#39;t have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I&#39;m sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn&#39;t the 1930&#39;s or 40&#39;s, and we are in America. But it&#39;s still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. <br/><br/>World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It&#39;s a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I&#39;m not talking about Adrien Brody&#39;s character. You&#39;ll see what I mean.<br/><br/>10/10"

        "text": "This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody."

      {
        "summary": "10 out of 10",
        "text": "The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.<br/><br/>\nPolanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist&#39;s own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of &quot;point of view shooting&quot; by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).<br/><br/>Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people&#39;s and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film&#39;s poetry.<br/><br/>In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).<br/><br/>This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin&#39;s music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski&#39;s usual story-frame).<br/><br/>Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.<br/><br/>Polanski&#39;s film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody&#39;s amazing performance, Polanski&#39;s sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski&#39;s long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood."

        "text": "I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.<br/><br/>How wrong I was.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. <br/><br/>Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary&#39;s Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar&#39;s are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a &quot;film&quot; like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I&#39;ve witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.<br/><br/>I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

        "text": "The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland&#39;s most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.<br/><br/>Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler&#39;s List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler&#39;s List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler&#39;s List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist&#39;s Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.<br/><br/>Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, &quot;What will happen to us?&quot; and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.<br/><br/>A mention must be made of Brody&#39;s performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee&#39;s &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; and Terrence Malick&#39;s &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.<br/><br/>Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn&#39;t until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn&#39;t as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren&#39;t words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.<br/><br/>The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn&#39;t even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

        "text": "This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It&#39;s not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can&#39;t speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there&#39;s no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house&#39; has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman&#39;s head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I&#39;ve seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD&#39;s flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody&#39;s job often was), I&#39;d be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody&#39;s turn! :-)"

        "text": "The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski&#39;s account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.<br/><br/>The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman&#39;s story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.<br/><br/>There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist&#39;s father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. <br/><br/>What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it&#39;s treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  <br/><br/>Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what&#39;s in his mind. He&#39;s a man intent in not dying, but he&#39;s not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can&#39;t contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.<br/><br/>In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell."

        "text": "Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.<br/><br/>Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.<br/><br/>Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.<br/><br/>Pawel Edelman&#39;s camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.<br/><br/>Hervé de Luze&#39;s editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.<br/><br/>The scene where Brody&#39;s fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.<br/><br/>Great film that will be in the running for this year&#39;s Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10."

        "text": "The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  <br/><br/>This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40&#39;s, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren&#39;t any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler&#39;s List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler&#39;s List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn&#39;t put in English speaking Germans).<br/><br/>In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski&#39;s best, a deserved of 2002&#39;s Palme D&#39;Or.  Great music too. A+"

        "text": "Fortunately, I&#39;m able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I&#39;ve read many comparisons between &quot;The Pianist&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man&#39;s inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody&#39;s Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970&#39;s, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don&#39;t envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.<br/><br/>Given the film&#39;s title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.<br/><br/>Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked &quot;The Ghetto&quot; was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about &#39;rich&#39; Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in &quot;Shtikat Haarchion&quot; (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in &quot;The Pianist&quot; or &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;, if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term &quot;Never Again&quot; be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world."

      "plot_summary": "In September 1939, Wladyslaw Szpilman, a celebrated Polish-Jewish radio pianist in Warsaw, plays live on the radio when the station is bombed during the German invasion. He returns home to his comfortable family apartment to find Warsaw increasingly under Nazi control: Jews must wear armbands, lose jobs, and face public humiliation. The Szpilman family sell belongings, including his piano, and by November 1940 are forced into the overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto. Wladyslaw finds work performing in a cafe inside the ghetto. On 16 August 1942 the family is rounded up for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp; at the Umschlagplatz a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police separates Szpilman from the line, letting him escape while the rest of his family is sent away and murdered. Szpilman becomes a forced laborer dismantling parts of the ghetto and helps smuggle weapons for the planned uprising, but soon decides to escape into the non-Jewish city.\n\nWith help from friends — Andrzej Bogucki and his wife Janina, caretaker Gebczynski, and his friend Dorota — Szpilman goes into hiding in a series of empty apartments and rooms in Warsaw. He lives in near-silence on smuggled food, observes the April 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising from a hiding place, and narrowly avoids capture several times. When his first hiding apartment must be abandoned because resistance weapons are discovered, Gebczynski gives Szpilman an emergency address and leaves. Szpilman later breaks some dishes, alerting neighbors, and flees to Dorota, who arranges another hiding place in the German quarter with a man named Szalas. Szalas proves unreliable and pockets money meant for Szpilman, leaving him ill and near starvation; Dorota and her husband obtain a doctor to treat his jaundice.\n\nIn August 1944 the Polish Home Army launches the Warsaw Uprising; the Germans respond by razing the city and evacuating or killing civilians. Szpilman’s building is destroyed by shells; he flees through fighting and hides in an abandoned hospital, then jumps into the deserted ghetto and wanders among the ruins as the city is systematically demolished. Alone and starving, he scavenges for food and shelter. In late 1944 he breaks into an abandoned house and is discovered by Wehrmacht officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who recognizes Szpilman and, upon hearing him play Chopin on a ruined grand piano, spares him. Hosenfeld secretly brings Szpilman food and allows him to hide in the attic; the two develop a guarded, human connection. In January 1945, with the Red Army approaching, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his greatcoat and promises to help him after the war, then leaves. During the German retreat Szpilman is nearly killed when Polish liberating troops mistake him for a German because of the coat; they shoot and then take him into custody and save his life.\n\nAfter the war Szpilman survives and returns to music. He later hears that Hosenfeld was captured by the Soviets; in 1947 Szpilman learns Hosenfeld died in Soviet captivity in 1952. The film ends with Szpilman performing publicly as a celebrated pianist and an epilogue noting he died in 2000 at age 88.",

      "in september 1939, wladyslaw szpilman / wladek (adrian brody), a polish-hebrew pianist, plays on radio in warsaw when the station is bombed during nazi germany's invasion of poland at the outbreak of world war ii. the polish army has been defeated in three weeks by the german army and szpilman's radio station is bombed while he plays live on the air. while evacuating the building he finds a friend of his who introduces him to his sister, dorota. szpilman is immediately attracted to her. after escaping, szpilman and his family prepare to leave the city when they learn that britain and france have declared war on germany. relieved at the news, szpilman and his family choose to stay in the city and celebrate. their celebrations are short-lived as warsaw becomes part of the nazi-controlled general government.\nbut germany defeats poland quickly and its troops enter warsaw, where life for hebrews deteriorates as the nazi authorities prevent them from working or owning businesses and force them to wear blue star of david armbands.\nwladek meets with dorota, who accompanies him around warsaw to learn of the injustice hebrew people have to face under the new nazi regime. businesses that were once friendly to them now won't allow their patronage. wladek's father is harshly forbidden to walk on the sidewalk in the city by two german officers; when he begins to protest, one of the officers hits him in the face.\nszpilman and his family sell many of their material belongings, including his piano, in order to make enough zlotys to survive. by november 1940, szpilman and his family have been forced from their home into the overcrowded warsaw ghetto where conditions only get worse. they struggle under the ghetto's squalid conditions, with disease and starvation rampant. szpilman finds work by performing in a cafe frequented by upper-class hebrews, who smuggle in forbidden goods in order to live comfortably. on one occasion, he sees a young boy being savagely beaten by a guard while trying to crawl through a gap in the ghetto wall. the boy is dead by the time szpilman can pull him through.\npeople starve, the guards are brutal, and corpses are left in the streets. on one occasion, the szpilmans witness the ss kill an entire family during a lapanka (raid) in an apartment across the street. the eldest man is unable to stand when ordered because he is confined to a wheelchair and the ss officers throw him over the balcony to his death. the other family members are gunned down in the street and run over by the ss truck if they survived. the aged father must apply for working papers through a friend of wladek's, so that he can take a job in a german clothier.\non 16 august 1942 the family are deported to treblinka extermination camp. henryk and halina are selected and taken away and the rest of the family is sent to the umschlagplatz to wait for transport. the father uses the family's last 20 zlotys to buy a piece of candy from a boy. each family member eats a tiny morsel of candy, their last meal together. at the umschlagplatz, szpilman is about to board the train when a friend from the hebrew ghetto police separates him away from his family and allows him to escape. szpilman is unable to save the rest of his family, and they are sent away to the camps. szpilman becomes a slave laborer and learns of a coming hebrew revolt. he hides for a few days in the cafe he played piano in with his old boss there. he later blends in with the ten percent or so of the hebrews that the nazis kept alive in the ghetto to use for slave labor, tearing down the brick walls separating the ghetto and rebuilding apartment houses for new, non-hebrew residents. he helps by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. after this close call, he decides he must escape and take his chances in the larger city. he then manages to escape and goes into hiding with help from non-hebrew friend andrzej bogucki (ronan vibert) and his wife janina (ruth platt). they take wladyslaw to his caretaker gebczynski (a man with the polish resistance), who hides him for one night. the next day gebczynski takes him to a vacant apartment near the ghetto wall, where he can live indefinitely on smuggled food. he must be silent however, since several non-hebrews also live in the building and believe the apartment is empty. in april 1943 szpilman observes from his window the warsaw ghetto uprising he aided and its ultimate failure.\nlater, gebczynski wants to move wladek as the nazis have found the weapons of the polish resistance, forcing gebczynski to be on the run also. gebczynski says it's only a matter of time before the nazis find the apartment wladek is hiding in. wladek decides to stay put, feeling safer where he is. his friend gives him an address to go to in case of an emergency, and leaves, gravely warning wladek not to be caught alive by the nazis. wladyslaw remains in the apartment a few more months until he has an accident, breaking some dishes. the noise has blown his cover, and he has to scurry out of the building, being chased by an angry german woman who suspects him of being hebrew. wladek goes to the emergency address he was given and meets his old friend dorota (emilia fox), whose husband provides him with another hiding place in the middle of the german quarter. he is shown into a room with a piano yet is compelled to keep quiet. his new caretaker, szalas, is very slack about smuggling in food, and wladyslaw once more faces starvation, while beginning to suffer from jaundice. dorota and her husband visit szpilman for the last time, providing him with a doctor to treat his illness. they report that szalas had been collecting money from generous and unwitting donors and had pocketed it all, leaving wladek to die in isolation. in august 1944, the polish resistance attack a german building across the street from szpilman's hideout during the warsaw uprising. the poles tried to retake control of their city. soon the germans start attacking the building and he has to flee. the poles had expected the advancing soviet red army to help them, but the russians did not come, instead allowing the germans to put down the revolt, and drive the entire remaining population of warsaw out of the city. a tank shells his apartment, forcing him to escape and hide elsewhere. the home army attacks the schutzpolizei hospital across the street from the apartment, while szpilman's apartment building is destroyed in the fighting, forcing him to flee and hide in the now abandoned hospital. the germans had by then decided to burn warsaw to ashes, so wladyslaw flees the hospital and jumps back over the wall into the ghetto, now an abandoned, desolate wasteland of bricks and rubble.\nover the course of the next months, the city is destroyed and abandoned, leaving szpilman alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. szpilman wanders through the city's ruins. he eventually makes his way to an abandoned home where he finds a can of pickles. while trying to open it he is discovered by the wehrmacht officer wilm hosenfeld (thomas kretschmann), who learns that szpilman is a pianist and asks him to play on a grand piano in the house. the decrepit szpilman plays chopin's ballade in g minor, which moves hosenfeld enough to allow szpilman to hide in the attic of the empty house where the german captain regularly brings him food. in january 1945, the germans are forced to retreat due to the advance of the red army. hosenfeld meets szpilman for the last time and promises he will listen to him on polish radio after the war. he gives szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm and leaves. however, this has almost fatal consequences for szpilman when he is mistaken for a german officer and shot at by polish troops liberating warsaw, who then apprehend and save him. in spring 1945, former inmates of a nazi concentration camp pass a soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured german soldiers and verbally abuse them. hosenfeld, among those captured, overhears a released inmate lament over his former career as a violinist. he asks the violinist if he knows szpilman, which the violinist confirms. hosenfeld wishes for szpilman to return the favor and help release him. sometime later, the violinist is able to bring szpilman back to the site, but they find it has been long abandoned. later, szpilman performs chopin's grand polonaise brillante to a large and prestigious audience. an epilogue states that szpilman died at the age of 88 in the year 2000, while hosenfeld died in soviet captivity in 1952, seven long years after the war had officially ended."

        "text": "&quot;The Notebook&quot; is an American 2-hour movie from 2004, so this one is also already way over a decade old now. It is considered to be a defining movie of the 21st century when it comes to romance, heart-throb and cheering for the characters to become a couple. Lead actors Gosling and McAdams were a couple themselves back then and their performances in this movie made it possibly hard to believe that they split up sooner than later. Many still remember that kiss at the MTV Movie Awards as something truly special that no other awards show from that year had to offer. But first things first: The director is Nick Cassavetes and he is the son of Gena Rowlands who plays a major supporting character here. Another major supporting character is played by the late James Garner. He received an SAG Award nomination for his portrayal and this may have been the closest he ever got to becoming an Oscar nominee, at the tender age of 75 and after almost 50 years in the industry already. The four actors I just mentioned are probably what you can consider the core of the film, the heart and soul. Connolly adds some solid scenes in the first half, Schaff in the second half. These 120 minutes are certainly the most known work for Cassavetes as well as for the two writers Leven and Sardi, even if one of them received an Oscar nomination for the Oscar-winning &quot;Shine&quot;.<br/><br/>So yeah, this film here is really really famous to this day. It was not as much as a box office success as you may think, but still made roughly 50 million more than it cost. I&#39;d imagine it to be a huge magnet for couples, but apparently many of the guys refused to join their girlfriends and it is definitely a movie that is appreciated more by females than by males, possibly because the concept of eternal love and mastering all the hurdles on the path to happiness is a plot subject that female audiences appreciate more with their approach to romance. Anyway, I quite enjoyed the watch here. I do believe the first 90 minutes of the film had occasional struggles in terms of coherent and realistic story-telling, but there were also scenes that made more than up for it, for example the meeting high up in the air when he asks her for a date facing somewhat playfully the danger of suicide. This was one of my favorite scenes from the Gosling/McAdams moments. The short inclusion of war was a bit random as it was too much of an important subject to be rushed in, even if something crucial happens there and it&#39;s fine I guess as the story is about love and not politics or war. And besides, it helped putting the film into perspective in terms of what time we were at what point in the movies. There were other good and not so good scenes and it probably depends on your personal preference which ones you like more and which ones will do nothing for you. For McAdams, it has been a pretty good year recently as she managed her first Oscar nomination and Gosling seems on course to winning his first Golden Globe this year, which means the protagonists in this film are far from forgotten.<br/><br/>And this especially includes the previously mentioned James Garner, who left us a very touching portrayal of an old man struggling with his place in life now that his beloved wife seems to forget him because of dementia/Alzheimer&#39;s. These moments when she remembers him are still what he has that connects the two (apart from the children of course) and what makes his life worth living in the face of his own health problems. I personally do not think that the plot twist about who the old people are is what the movie is about because it can be understood and predicted quickly anyway. It is much more about who they have become and the glorious and happy moments take place in the years that we do not see on screen. What we see is just how they got together / are together. So yeah, the last 20 minutes or so have to be among the most touching stuff you will see from the 21st century. Garner shines and Rowlands plays her part very well too. And the story will certainly make your eyes wet. Nicholas Sparks at his best (apart from A Walk to Remember possibly, one of my favorite films of all time). What can I say? You have to experience it yourself to feel the pain, but also to feel the positive moments that make love the best thing in the world. I also believe that these final moments of the film show us how good the flashbacks were and that they did leave a mark for sure, even if you may not have felt it as strongly while watching these scenes from the 1940s and 1950s for example. You may not be amazed by what you see there, but it&#39;s essential to really appreciate the ending. Overall, I think this was a film that is good throughout the entirety and turns great at the end, which makes it one of 2004&#39;s best. Of course, I connected especially strongly with the film as I find Alzheimer one of the saddest things ever, but still it was an extremely rewarding watch and it&#39;s impossible to not feel anything while seeing it. I highly recommend to see it (if there&#39;s still people out there who haven&#39;t). And make sure you have your girl next to you and lots of tissues."

        "summary": "My Favorite Scene was the One with the Geese, not the Gosling",
        "text": "Prior to watching &quot;The Notebook,&quot; I was not familiar with the work of the actress Rachel McAdams. She made an indelible impression by sustaining an outstanding performance in this film. Her character Allie is the pivotal role in the film, as she must make the crucial romantic decision on which the story turns. There are few performers capable of evolving the complexity of characterization as achieved by Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>The film recreated effectively the world of the 1940s in America, including the parental pressure exerted by the well-to-do family of Allie on whether to allow their daughter to pursue a young man from the other side of the tracks. As played by Ryan Gosling, the character of Noah could have revealed more emotional layers. There was only one scene in the film where he really showed that there was something at stake in his love for Allie. He apparently wrote her a passionate letter every day for a year. Especially in the film&#39;s early scenes, Gosling could have shown more of the passion.<br/><br/>The other cast members were outstanding, including James Garner and Gena Rowlands in the parallel story. In the two plots, &quot;The Notebook&quot; merits comparison with another outstanding romantic film, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County.&quot; As the two subplots of &quot;The Notebook&quot; come together, one of the key characters is Allie&#39;s mother. As always, Joan Allen delivers a convincing and complete character portrayal, as the well-intentioned, but conflicted mother. In one of the most moving scenes in the film, the mother opens up to the daughter and tells her story of youthful love and a fateful choice similar to the one Allie herself must face.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film: a wonderful sequence where Noah and Allie are in a boat in the backwaters of South Carolina. The waterway is simply filled with white geese. It is a stunning and picturesque moment, among many in this well-crafted film. If there is such a spot in South Carolina, then I want to go there!"

I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten."

        "summary": "The Notebook : Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks",
        "text": "Often times when a movie comes from source material such as a novel that did well, the people who were fans of the book end up not liking the movie as much. Sometimes those same fans even end up hating the movie, or not even giving it a chance by seeing it. Such was the case, that I already knew the ending of Nicholas Sparks&#39;s novel even before I got into the theater. Let me clear up though, that the best thing about the film was that I ended up getting wrapped in the story on the screen, rather than sitting there thinking to myself what part of the story should be coming next. That is what makes a great adaptation, when you can get lost in the story, and forget about your thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world. Not only that, but the film soared past any expectations that I had for it from the start too, by being very well Directed and acted. <br/><br/>Best known for his acting credits, Nick Cassavetes was tapped to direct this film. His past experience, which didn&#39;t consist of very many films includes the Denzel Washington film John Q. This was not going to be an easy task for him though, because the story was built on us believing the love that the main characters of the film would be showing was real. It?s not as easy as it sounds, and some films (like Star Wars Part 2), end up making the audience laugh, rather than feel what the characters are feeling. He did a great job, and helped put together a great cast for this film that would end up including Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, and Joan Allen. All actors who have found their niches before, and were brought in to this film to help carry the story. <br/><br/>Gosling is best known for his role as &quot;Richie&quot;, one of the kids, in Murder By Numbers. He brings a great innocence to the role of Noah Calhoun in the film, one of the two main characters. Rachel McAdams plays the other half of the duo as Allie Hamilton. She was actually one of the leads (Regina George) in an earlier Summer movie, Mean Girls. At the heart of this film the couple represents the love story that is being told by James Garner&#39;s character. He reads from a book , the story of the two lovers as they go through everything life has to offer. Gena Rowlands plays the lady that he is reading to, and she gets as wrapped up in the story as we do, as he progresses from chapter to chapter in the novel he is reading. Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the story, Noah and Allie meet in one of the cutest scenes of the movie. He sees her at a carnival, and knows right away that he wants to be with her. He does not know quite why at first, and all he can say is that something inside of him is drawing him to her. He convinces her to give him a chance, and she eventually agrees to give him the date that he seeks. What progresses from there is a Summer romance that goes through all of the emotions that we all have experienced before. What makes it even more real, is that it is not played off as if every single moment is perfect between the two of them. It depicts that they do have fights, that they do have disagreements, but that they do have a love that is stronger than any of that. This is what made the romance real for me. Everyone knows, that in real life we can&#39;t have a relationship where everything works out perfectly, or where everyone agrees on everything. <br/><br/>The romance blossoms, but a problem exists that could spell trouble. Noah is from a one- parent family, and sees himself working at a lumber-yard for the better part of his life. He says that he has found his place in life, and this is what the &quot;cards&quot; have planned for him. Allie on the other hand, come from a very well-off family, and is being brought up in a rich societal circle. Her family is spending her 17th Summer in the small town by the sea, and first comes across Noah by pure coincidence. The romance between them is kept under wraps for quite a while, until her parents find out. The mother immediately thinks that is should end, but the father feels that it is just a summer &quot;thing&quot; that will come to an end rather quickly. That is, until she is out late one night with Noah, and he takes the side of his wife. They see no future between their daughter and this &quot;boy&quot;, and take her away from him the first chance they get. <br/><br/>That coupled with the outbreak of World War II keeps them apart for a couple of years, and the story really gets underway. Will their love be able to endure the separation, or will one of them move on to something that is easier in their own lives? The story becomes an epic of its own, as its starts to split time between the story being read, and the story of Garner and Rowlands living in the present day. This is what I love about films like these, as we are given the opportunity to enjoy two different stories going on at the same time. The love shown by Noah and Allie is something that envelopes us, and it makes us forget about the current story. By going back and forth, we are able to look forward to where each of the two stories is going. All of it leads to an ending of each story that is both very enjoyable, and very emotional at the same time. <br/><br/>As I said before, sometimes a book can fail to transition to film. This is not one of those cases, as the movie instead becomes its own entity. Both stories have great chemistry between the characters at the center of them. It is amazing just how well the actors/actresses in the parts play their roles, and just how much we as an audience start to care about their lives. As it progresses, we truly care about what will happen to the main characters, and we have in our own minds how we want things to turn out. It is that type of film, where we start to become part of the story, and want them to act or say something specific, that truly makes a great story. Even though this is a movie that is heavily geared to lovers of romance novels, this is a film that I found very enjoyable. I highly recommend seeing this film while it is in theaters, or purchasing it when it hits DVD, because it has everything that is needed for a truly great love story."

Boy meets girl at a carnival, love from the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you&#39;ve heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Too bad there can&#39;t be movies like this every year..."

It is structurally very similar to &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, which is also one of my all time favorite movies.<br/><br/>Unlike &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, this focuses on young love as it grows and endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the &quot;Romeo and Juilet&quot; theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you are cynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to another person, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not that cynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughly taken in by the story.<br/><br/>This is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and very likable.

The notebook recounts a 1940s romance on Seabrook Island, South Carolina. In 1940, 17-year-old Allison “Allie” Hamilton (Rachel McAdams), an affluent heiress, meets poor lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) at a carnival. Noah pursues her; after dramatic flirting on a ferris wheel he coerces her into a date. They fall passionately in love, spending the summer together; Noah teaches Allie to swim and drive, and they plan a future in an abandoned Windsor Plantation house Noah intends to buy and restore to her specifications (white house, blue shutters, water-view room, wraparound porch). Allie’s mother Anne (Joan Allen) disapproves of Noah’s class and forbids contact. After a heated argument, Allie impulsively breaks up with Noah; her parents move the family back to Charleston and Anne intercepts Noah’s letters so Allie never receives them. Noah writes every day for a year (365 letters) and then stops when none are returned. Noah enlists with his friend Fin (Kevin Connolly) and fights in World War II; Fin dies in the Battle of the Bulge. Allie volunteers in a hospital, meets Captain Lon Hammond Jr. (James Marsden), a wealthy suitor, and becomes engaged. After the war Noah returns, restores the Windsor house exactly to Allie’s specs, and refuses to sell. Allie sees a newspaper photo of Noah’s finished house, takes a pre-wedding trip to visit Seabrook, and reunites with Noah; they consummate their love. Noah reveals he wrote to her daily and that Anne intercepted the letters. Anne admits she once loved beneath her class and, guilt-ridden, returns the hidden letters to Allie. Allie tells Lon the truth and breaks the engagement, recommitting to Noah. In the nursing home present, Duke is revealed to be Noah using the name to avoid frightening his disoriented wife; the woman is elderly Allie (Gena Rowlands) suffering from advanced dementia/Alzheimer’s. Noah has recorded or preserved their story (Allie’s own journal) and reads it to her each day to jog her memory. Near the notebook’s end, Allie briefly recognizes Noah, asks how long the memory will last, and he says perhaps five minutes; they dance to their song. Allie’s dementia relapses; she panics and is sedated. Noah has a heart attack and is hospitalized in the same facility. That night Noah sneaks into Allie’s room; Allie again briefly remembers, they reassure each other about their life and children, embrace, and fall asleep together. In the morning a nurse finds both dead in each other’s arms.",

      "at a modern-day nursing home, an elderly man, duke (james garner), reads a romantic story from his notebook to a fellow patient allie. both duke and allie live in a nursing home. in 1940, seabrook island, south carolina, poor lumber mill worker noah calhoun (ryan gosling) sees 17-year-old heiress allison \"allie\" hamilton (rachel mcadams) at a carnival. he pursues her, coerces her into dating him. noah approaches allie to ask for a dance, which she refuses. allie goes on the ferris wheel with a friend, and noah jumps on the wheel and sits in the same carriage as allie. noah asks allie out for a date, but she refuses again. noah threatens to jump off the wheel unless allie agrees to the date. allie agrees to go out on a date with noah, to stop him from jumping off. later, allie refuses to honor her promise of a date. noah uses his friend fin and his girlfriend sara (heather wahlquist) to lure allie for a movie night and noah reaches there with fin. noah later walks allie home. allie reveals that she had not seen a movie in ages, as she doesn't have much time. her schedule is decided by her parents, and she has tutors and activities almost all day. noah goads allie by insinuating that she is not free to do as she pleases. they share a dance in the middle of the street.\nnoah and allie start a romance. they started spending every waking hour together and fall in love with each other. they argued a lot, and rarely agreed on anything, but they also had a lot of fun. allie learned swimming and how to drive a truck, with noah. despite their differences they were crazy about each other. when allie meets noah's father frank calhoun (sam shepard), he immediately likes her. frank is warm, inviting and free of any prejudice. however, when noah meets her parents, they disapprove. noah is made to admit that he makes 40 cents an hour at his job at the lumberyard. they believe that noah has too much spirit for allie, who comes from a different background and circumstances. noah takes allie to an abandoned house at windsor plantation that he intends to buy for them. allie also gives specs to noah that she wants incorporated in the house for herself. she wants a white house with blue shutters, and a room overlooking the water, where she can paint. a big porch that wraps around the house, where they can sip tea and watch the sun go down.\nthey try to make love for the first time (allie is talking too much and is very nervous, while noah wanted to be patient and respectful to her feelings) but are interrupted by noah's friend fin (kevin connolly) with the news that allie's parents have the police looking for her. when allie and noah return to her parents' mansion, allie's mother anne (joan allen) calls noah trash (she says that allie is likely to end up pregnant or heartbroken) and they ban her from seeing noah. allie says that her parents don't know anything about love as they don't enjoy each other's company at all. noah walks out and allie chases after him. they have an ensuing argument (noah says that allie is eventually going to leave him and suggests that they slow things down between them), and she impulsively breaks up with him, but immediately regrets it.\nthe next morning, anne announces that the family is returning home to charleston. allie attempts to contact noah, but is unable to find him, so she asks fin to tell noah that she loves him. allie says that it is not over between them and that they just had a fight the previous day.\nwhen noah gets the message he rushes to allie's home, only to find the house gated up and empty. noah writes to allie every day for a year, but anne intercepts the letters such that they never reach allie. when all 365 go unanswered, he stops writing to move on.\nnoah enlists with fin to fight in world war ii and fight in the battle of the bulge, where fin is killed in battle. allie volunteers in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets captain lon hammond jr. (james marsden), a young lawyer who comes from old southern money. after a few years being together, the two become engaged to the delight of allie's parents. when noah returns from the war, his father has sold their home so that noah can buy the abandoned house. while visiting charleston, noah witnesses allie and lon kissing at a restaurant; he convinces himself that if he restores the house, allie will come back to him. once it's completed, noah resists selling it.\nlater, while allie is being fitted for her wedding dress, allie is startled to see in the newspaper that noah has completed the house to the specifications she made years before. after allie asks permission from lon to take a little trip before the wedding, allie returns to seabrook to find noah living in the restored house. the two renew their relationship and make love. noah tells allie about the 365 letters, and they realize her mother kept them from her. several days later, anne appears in the morning on noah's doorstep to warn allie that lon has followed her to seabrook. she also reveals that she once loved a lower-class young man in town and still wonders how changed their lives would have been if she had chosen differently.\nnoah and allie argue and he tells her to decide what she wants, not what everyone else does. she drives back to her hotel, sobbing and confused.\nanne then gives allie the letters that noah wrote to her as an admission that she had hidden them from allie. subsequently, allie confesses to lon that she had spent time with noah, and eventually returns to her relationship with noah. in the present narrative, it is revealed that the elderly woman is dementia-stricken allie (gena rowlands), duke is actually noah, who uses a pseudonym to not startle her in her disoriented state. the journal he reads to her she wrote during the early stages of her illness, detailing their romance and life together so he could help her come back to him. noah has kept the promise to read it to her almost daily. almost at the end of the journal in the notebook, allie asks noah what happened at the end of the story and noah prompts her that she knows. she briefly recognizes him and remembers. allie asks how long they have before she forgets again and duke tells her possibly five minutes. they dance to their song, \"i'll be seeing you\", and she asks about their kids. however, allie's dementia quickly relapses and she panics to see a stranger touching her, so is sedated. noah suffers a heart attack and is sent to the hospital while allie is sent to a dementia ward in the same hospital. noah visits allie's room in the middle of the night causing her to remember him again and proceeds to remind her of her illness, though he reassures her that they can do anything with the love they share. while sleeping, both noah and allie pass away in each other's arms and a nurse discovers them in the morning."

      "an elderly man recounts the love story of a young couple from different social backgrounds. their relationship faces challenges of family, society, and time. the narrative reflects on memory, enduring love, and the impact of life choices on personal relationships.",

      "the movie focuses on an old man reading a story to an old woman in a nursing home. the story he reads follows two young lovers named allie hamilton and noah calhoun, who meet one evening at a carnival. but they are separated by allie's parents who disapprove of noah's unwealthy family, and move allie away. after waiting for noah to write her for several years, allie meets and gets engaged to a handsome young soldier named lon. allie, then, with her love for noah still alive, stops by noah's 200-year-old home that he restored for her, \"to see if he's okay.\" it is evident that they still have feelings for each other, and allie has to choose between her fiancé and her first love."

Basically this is a romantic comedy about a man (Henry) and a woman (Lucy) who meet and fall in love, there is just one problem: Lucy won&#39;t remember, tomorrow.<br/><br/>It is easy to pick holes in films and yes there are things wrong with this film:- <br/><br/><ul><li>The first 5 to 10 minutes do seem a little out of place: I understand the need to set the scene, but couldn&#39;t help feeling that the pace and characterisations didn&#39;t quite fit with what was to come.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the characters take away from the story: Doug (Sean Astin) is a little over done and comes across as more damaged than his sister. Perhaps the worst, though, is Henry&#39;s female (?) assistant: this character was a mistake and did not belong in the film.</li></ul><br/><br/>In the end, these flaws don&#39;t matter: the film is enjoyable and that is what counts.<br/><br/>The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the film believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. Some of the difficult aspects of the film are not ignored but properly dealt with. Clearly it is easy to read a sordid side into the idea of a man meeting a beautiful woman each day in the knowledge that she will forget everything and they can start again tomorrow. This is covered and Henry is asked some pointed questions; without giving anything away, his answers worked and leave us, the audience, able to enjoy the film, without any unpleasant nagging doubts or feelings of guilt.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t analyse or pick holes; just watch this film. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it. It is a fantasy a bit of escapism: a first rate piece of entertainment and hopefully it will leave you, as it did me, feeling pleasantly content."

        "text": "The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn&#39;t even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn&#39;t overly stupid, but it&#39;s not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film&#39;s true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry&#39;s character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn&#39;t really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn&#39;t even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended."

We took a chance the other night when it was shown on cable, and frankly, we found the movie entertaining. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, &quot;Punch Drunk Love&quot;.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.<br/><br/>The supporting cast plays well together. A surprise was Rob Schneider, not one of my favorite actors, either, but in here, under the direction of Peter Segal, he delivers. Sean Astin, as the lisping brother on steroids is quite effective, as well as Blake Clark, as Lucy&#39;s father. Dan Aykroyd puts an appearance as the doctor who treats the young woman who has lost her long term memory.<br/><br/>Watch it without any preconceptions, as probably it will surprise you."

How will Henry cope with this? The movie gravitates between goofy and sensitive, but never gets mind-numbing; Adam Sandler always has something up his sleeve, and he and Barrymore have a great time with the material. As is often the case in Adam Sandler&#39;s movies, one of the characters is an embarrassment to everyone else (in this case, it&#39;s Rob Schneider as Henry&#39;s whacked-out friend Ula).

I am not a religious person and this made me feel closer to what people often call God, whatever that is. Maybe I exaggerate, but I want to.

Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler&#39;s last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn&#39;t very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there&#39;s also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy."

Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler create a synergy that neither has been able to capture with anyone else. Together, they produce a romantic team comparable to Gere and Roberts, Day and Hudson, Grant and Loren and Tracy and Hepburn. My wife and I watch &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; at least once a year. While &quot;50 First Dates&quot; is a superior movie, I don&#39;t know if I can take the melancholy ending again.<br/><br/>\nFor once I&#39;m grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler&#39;s acting ensemble, particulary Sean Astin and Rob Schneider.  If Schneider wasn&#39;t playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce. The goofy humor makes the basically tragic scenario not only bearable but almost pleasant. It&#39;s also genuinely funny.<br/><br/>Sandler convincingly plays a marine biologist(!!!)in Hawaii who enjoys &quot;entertaining&quot; the &quot;mainlanders.&quot; Sandler doesn&#39;t date &quot;locals&quot;. He wants nothing to interfere with his dream of studying walruses. He discovers Barrymore having breakfast in a local bar and grill. What captures Sandler&#39;s attention, even more than her beauty, is Barrymore&#39;s creativity. What Sandler doesn&#39;t know is that Barrymore has brain damage. The brain cells which move short term memory to long term storage are destroyed. She forgots everything she&#39;s learned during the day while she sleeps. So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours. That&#39;s writing genius, something you don&#39;t see very often, and Sandler, Barrymore, and Sandler&#39;s acting troupe handle it perfectly.<br/><br/>Though my wife is physically handicapped, my mother has severe short term memory loss. So, I really related to the trajedy so expertly portrayed in &quot;50 First Dates&quot;. It&#39;s not often I give a movie that leaves me this sad a &quot;10&quot;. The last time, I believe, was &quot;Sommersby&quot;. Nonetheless, &quot;50 First Dates&quot; is a &quot;10,&quot; since there is nothing about it I can suggest that make it better. <br/><br/>P.S.

After his sailboat Sea Serpent is disabled, Henry stops at the Hukilau Cafe and meets Lucy Whitmore, a local-looking artist. They hit it off and agree to meet the next morning, but Lucy fails to recognize him. Sue, the cafe owner, explains that Lucy suffers from anterograde amnesia from a car accident that occurred a year earlier on her father Marlin’s birthday; she wakes each morning believing it is that day and cannot form new memories. To spare Lucy daily trauma, Marlin and Lucy’s brother Doug re-enact the same Sunday routine (newspaper, shampoo bottles, a Vikings game, The Sixth Sense) every evening so she wakes to the scripted day.\n\nHenry pursues Lucy anyway, repeatedly reintroducing himself after she forgets him each night. He learns Lucy only sings the Beach Boys’ \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" on days she has met someone new, which persuades Marlin and Doug to let Henry keep seeing her. Henry’s friends (Ula, Alexa) and his life at Sea Life Park provide background friction; Henry gradually gives up parts of his playboy lifestyle. After Henry accidentally hurts Lucy’s feelings, he apologizes and continues to engineer meetings. When Lucy briefly realizes the calendar date after a parking-ticket incident, Marlin and Doug confess the daily ruse; Lucy is devastated.\n\nHenry makes a video that explains Lucy’s accident, her condition, and documents their relationship; Marlin and Doug show it to her every morning so her days can continue without repeating the traumatic accident. Lucy spends more time with Henry and old friends and begins painting again. Henry ultimately reveals he is postponing his Bristol Bay research trip for a year to try to build a life with Lucy; overhearing this, Lucy asks him to erase their relationship for his sake. They destroy her journal entries and Henry prepares to leave. Marlin later tells Henry that Lucy moved into the brain-injury institute and teaches an art class there; Henry sails away but then recalls that Lucy only sings after meeting him, prompting him to return.\n\nAt the institute Henry discovers Lucy does not consciously remember him, but she has painted dozens of portraits of a man who is clearly Henry and says she dreams of him nightly. The film ends with Lucy watching a \"Good Morning Lucy\" tape that Henry made: it explains her life and concludes with footage of their wedding and a recorded instruction from Henry to put on a jacket and come have breakfast. The final scene reveals Henry, Marlin, and Lucy together on Henry’s boat in Alaska with their young daughter Nicole, showing that Henry stayed, Lucy retained emotional memory through dreams and art, and they formed a family despite her anterograde amnesia.",

      "henry roth (adam sandler) is a veterinarian at sea life park on the island of oahu, hawaii. he has a reputation of wooing female tourists, a strategy he employs to avoid becoming involved in a serious relationship. his closest friends are ula (rob schneider), a marijuana-smoking islander; alexa (lusia strus), his androgynous german assistant; willy, his pet african penguin; and jocko, a walrus that lives at the park.\nhenry has been saving up to go on a big boat trip to alaska (bristol bay) and hence does not want any attachments to the island. henry specializes in walruses and his boat trip is to further his research on walruses (in their unspoiled habitat) including what they do under the water, where they spend more than two thirds of their life. one day while sailing, his boat (named the \"sea serpent\") is damaged when the mast breaks and destroys the wheel. henry anchors the boat and takes a rubber dingy to the nearest shoreline.\nhe stops at the hukilau cafe until his boat can be towed back to port, and meets a young woman named lucy whitmore (drew barrymore). henry is instantly smitten with lucy.\nbelieving her to be a local, he avoids introducing himself, but the next day he returns. he and lucy hit it off and she asks him to meet her again the next morning. lucy says that her father marlin and brother doug are fishermen and go out to the sea for months at a time. however, when henry goes back to the cafe the following day, lucy has no memory of their previous meeting. the restaurant owner sue (amy hill) (and her chef and husband nick (pomaika'i brown)) explains to henry that, the previous year, lucy and her father marlin (blake clark) had a serious car accident on his birthday that left her with anterograde amnesia, which inhibits her ability to form new memories. as such, she wakes up every morning thinking it is sunday, october 13, of a year ago. to spare lucy the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, marlin and doug (sean astin), lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out the sunday newspaper, refilling lucy's shampoo bottles, re-watching the same minnesota vikings game, and re-watching the film the sixth sense. despite sue's warning, henry invites lucy to have breakfast with him. eventually she does, but it ends poorly when he unintentionally hurts her feelings. he follows her home to apologize, where marlin and doug instruct him to leave her alone. henry begins concocting ways to run into lucy on the following days.\neventually marlin and doug figure this out and tell henry that lucy sings the beach boys' \"wouldn't it be nice\" only on days when she has met him, the first major change in her routine since the accident. thinking that lucy may be making progress with her condition, they agree to let henry keep seeing her. one day, a police officer writes lucy a ticket for her expired plates. she attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, but realizes it is not october 13 as she thought. distraught and confused, lucy rushes home; marlin and doug admit their ruse.\nhenry comes up with an idea to make a video for lucy that explains her accident and their relationship. although she is upset each time she is told about her accident and memory loss, henry believes that she is more upset about realizing her life has been a lie every day. henry, marlin, and doug show lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off. she spends more time with henry and goes to see some of her old friends. one day, lucy overhears henry talking of his decision not to take a year-long sailing trip to bristol bay to study walruses, something he has been planning for the past 10 years, in favor of spending that year trying to help lucy and make her fall in love with him every day. so, she tells henry that, for his sake, she will erase him completely from her life. henry reluctantly helps lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship. a few weeks later, henry is preparing to leave for his trip. before he departs, marlin tells him that lucy is now living at the brain injury institute where she was first diagnosed and teaching an art class there. he also tells him that she sings. as he is sailing away, henry remembers that marlin once told him that lucy only sings after she meets him. concluding that she remembers him, he rushes to the institute and asks her if lucy knows who he is. she says she does not. lucy then shows him dozens of pictures she has painted of him, saying that although she has no idea who he is, she dreams about him almost every night. sometime later, lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked \"good morning lucy.\" it again informs her of her accident but ends with her and henry's wedding. on the tape, henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready. lucy then sees that she is on henry's boat, which finally made it to alaska. she goes up on deck and meets marlin, henry, and their young daughter, nicole."

        "text": "Matthew Goode thinks Leap Year is a terrible movie. What&#39;s odd about that is Goode is one of the stars of the movie. What&#39;s even more odd is that it is not at all a terrible movie. Yes, it is very predictable and formulaic. But sometimes you have to remember that in life there are established formulas because those formulas work. And Leap Year, for what it is intended to be, works. No, it is not by any means a serious motion picture. But not every movie is meant to be The Godfather. There&#39;s plenty of room in the world for a light, breezy, enjoyable romantic comedy. And Leap Year fits the bill.<br/><br/>Amy Adams plays Anna, an ultra-organized Boston woman who has her life planned out down to the tiniest detail. She patiently waits for Jeremy, her boyfriend of four years, to propose to her. Finally her patience runs out. When Jeremy takes off for Dublin for a cardiology convention Anna decides to follow him, intending to take advantage of an Irish tradition of women proposing to their men on Leap Day. Unfortunately a storm causes her flight to be diverted and when she finally gets to Ireland she&#39;s not in Dublin but way over on the other side of the country. Stuck in this rural no-man&#39;s land she needs transportation to Dublin. Enter Goode&#39;s character of Declan, the town&#39;s innkeeper, bartender and, most importantly, taxi driver. So Anna, the prim, proper girl with her whole life planned out and Declan, the earthy, sarcastic guy who flies by the seat of his pants set out on their road trip. Gee, you don&#39;t suppose this mismatched couple might end up falling for one another do you? It&#39;s a movie with very little drama. You know the formula, so you think you know where the story&#39;s headed. But just because you think you know the ultimate destination that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have some fun along the way. Leap Year is not a movie which is uproariously funny by an means but there are enough solid laughs scattered throughout to keep you smiling. The interplay between Adams and Goode is excellent. Adams is relentlessly charming and Goode makes for a very good rogue. The movie looks spectacular, the rolling Irish countryside a sight to behold and a wonderful setting for the story. Many people seem to bemoan what this movie isn&#39;t. They miss what it is. A charming, fun, entertaining romantic comedy. That&#39;s all the movie aspires to be and in this aim it succeeds. Adams is the perfect actress for this sort of thing, she lights up the screen. And Goode? He does well here too and for him I dearly hope the acting thing works out. Because he has no future as a film critic."

I thought it did. Goode and Adams are good together and, yes, there is a little bit too much Irish Tourism advertising going on, but still enough going on to keep us entertained. Feather light yes, but so what, that&#39;s not always a bad thing. All movies cannot be Schindlers List."

Has &quot;what she wants and not what she needs&quot;.<br/><br/>Jeremy (Adam Scott) - accomplished cardiologist with no need to be concerned. Has what he wants and not sure what he needs. Loves himself and thinks everyone else does, too.<br/><br/>Declan (Matthew Goode) - very much a Hugh Jackman &quot;coulda-been&quot;, content with what he has and thinks he needs nothing, Luck &#39;o the Irish did nothing for him but he doesn&#39;t believe in luck anyway.<br/><br/>As Anna herself put it, she has &quot;what she wants but not what she needs&quot;. Since becoming an accomplished &quot;Stager&quot;, decorating homes to display in hopes of selling, she happily puts herself on display, knowing exactly what it takes. We see her first known personal disappointment when she expects her boyfriend, Jeremy, to propose. He is so comfortable with her company, earrings are the obvious gift to surprise his girlfriend of 4 years, and not an engagement ring. She is further disappointed when he immediately has to leave the country temporarily. Being the woman she is, she spends no time with self pity but decides it&#39;s time to go to Dublin and propose to him as Leap Year permits.<br/><br/>Leap Year is an excellent romantic comedy. I was reminded of Doris Day and Audrey Hepburn comedies. Nothing hilarious, Amy really has wonderful physical comedic skills but still allows her charm to come across and make me smile. While the movie gets a little clumsy, nothing is bad enough to keep me from appreciating her. Her chemistry with Matthew Goode played well. He was fun to watch as the Irish he-man who lives a casual life with no expectations and no concern for others&#39;. But then along comes Anna, and their one-track lives intertwine and soon the future becomes less clear. Anna and Declan travel to Dublin finding strangers and situations that force them to examine life and its meaning, or lack thereof. A forked road appears and we find both now have reason to question a future with or without each other.<br/><br/>Please don&#39;t expect hilarity. Sit down, get comfy, and admire a good, simple love story. It&#39;s what we all need.<br/><br/>7 of 10"

This is yet another romantic comedy centering on an Irish folklore tradition when on Feb 29 every four years has females proposing marriage to their spouses! In this case it&#39;s actress Amy Adams and her misadventures into attempting to do just that, and at the same time build a rapport with someone else which is actor Matthew Goode who is being paid to guide her. It&#39;s basically another one of those films where viewers are aware about it&#39;s ending without knowing what it can offer in the middle which can sometimes showcase some really good moments, as well as avoidable awkward ones! It also can be looked at as an Irish rendition of a much more superior film called &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; starring John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga made in 1985. Amy Adams is still a wonderful to watch which kept this film from going under."

The film is peppered with inaccuracies about Ireland that boarder on racist. And yet, it&#39;s completely enjoyable. If you put away the microscope and look at the movie as a whole, I can almost guarantee a fan of romantic comedies will enjoy it. It&#39;s funny and sweet, silly and cliché, and unrealistically romantic. It is a work of pure fiction and fantasy and that is made very clear. But that&#39;s part of what makes it fun. We all know that fairy tales aren&#39;t real. No knight in shining armor is going to ride his white horse to save you from some dragon, for you do not live in a castle and he has no dragon to slay. But it&#39;s movies like these that allow us to escape to a world where these things do happen. So is it a masterpiece? No. Is it completely accurate? Not at all.

She plans to surprise him by flying to Dublin to propose on February 29, invoking an Irish leap-day tradition. En route her plane is diverted by a storm to Wales; she charters a boat but the storm forces it to put her ashore in the seaside village of Dingle, County Kerry. At a local tavern she meets surly innkeeper Declan O'Callaghan. Declan initially refuses to drive her to Dublin but agrees when his pub is threatened with foreclosure and Anna offers €500 to cover much of his debt. They set off in Declan's beat-up car with Anna's expensive Louis Vuitton suitcase (“Louie”).\n\nTheir cross-country journey becomes a series of misadventures: cows block a rural road and Anna steps in cow dung; while attempting to clean her shoes her handbrake-less car rolls into a stream; three travelers steal Anna's luggage and Declan fights them to recover it; they miss a train after exploring castle ruins and spend a night at a bed-and-breakfast in Tipperary where they pretend to be married and are forced to kiss at dinner. Their antagonistic banter gradually softens into mutual attraction. During a hail storm they shelter in a church hosting a wedding reception; Anna drinks too much, begins to question her motives toward Jeremy, and realizes she has feelings for Declan.\n\nThey arrive in Dublin the day before/ morning of February 29. Declan reveals he was once engaged and that his ex ran off to Dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. At the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy unexpectedly proposes to Anna in the lobby; Anna accepts but glances back to see Declan leaving. Back in Boston at their engagement party, Anna learns Jeremy proposed to satisfy a co-op board condition for their apartment purchase. Alarmed by how material and self-interested Jeremy is (he grabs electronics when Anna pulls a fire alarm to simulate fleeing), Anna realizes she does not love him. Meanwhile Declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex in Dublin. Anna returns to Dingle, finds Declan running his tavern successfully after rallying community support to pay his debts, and tells him she broke off the engagement and wants to be with him. Declan briefly leaves; he returns at the cliff overlooking the sea with his mother's ring and proposes to Anna. She accepts. The film ends with Anna and Declan together, leaving their future and destination open.",

      "successful real estate agent anna brady is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend jeremy sloane still has not proposed to her after four years. she decides to travel from boston to dublin, to propose to him on february 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. anna wishes to invoke an irish tradition that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal. during the flight, a storm diverts the plane to wales, where anna hires a boat to take her to cork. the severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called dingle, where she makes her way to a local tavern. anna tries to enlist the help of declan o'callaghan, the surly irish innkeeper. she requests him to taxi her across the country to dublin. at first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for eur500. the two set out in his old beat-up car. along the way, he makes fun of her fancy louis vuitton luggage, which he calls \"louie\". he also mocks her belief in a leap year \"tradition\" of women proposing to men. their travel is interrupted by a herd of cows blocking the road. anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her expensive shoes while leaning on declan's car which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. continuing on foot, anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. ignoring declan's warning, anna accepts the ride and hands them her luggage. before she can enter the van, they drive off without her. anna and declan eventually make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three van thieves going through anna's luggage. declan fights them, displaying unexpected strength for a man of his size, and retrieves anna's bag. anna and declan are ejected from the pub by the owner for fighting on the premises. anna and declan reach a railway station and decide to wait for the next train. while waiting, they hike up a hill to the ruins of a nearby castle. they ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. in doing so, declan also tells anna of an old irish legend about a young woman engaged to an elderly lord that she did not love. so the woman gave her wedding guests a sleeping potion so she could run away with a young celtic warrior she did love. during the story, they lose track of time and miss the train. that night, anna and declan are forced to stay at a local bed & breakfast in tipperary, where they pretend to be married, taking the name \"o'brady-callaghan\" so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. during dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, anna and declan are \"forced\" to kiss as well. this stirs feelings that neither had expected. that night, they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other. the next day while hitch-hiking down the road, anna and declan are caught in a hail-storm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. they are invited to the reception. but during the reception, anna drinks too much. anna begins to question her own intentions with jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for declan. just as the two are about to kiss, anna vomits and passes out. the following day they arrive in dublin, as they make their way on foot from the bus terminal to the hotel, declan reveals that he was once engaged but his fiancee ran off to dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. anna suggests to declan, now that he is in dublin, that he should ask for his mother's ring back. when they arrive at the hotel where jeremy is staying, jeremy surprises anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. anna turns around to look at declan just to see that he had already walked out of the hotel, and she accepts jeremy's proposal. at their engagement party in boston, anna learns that jeremy decided to propose because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple had wanted to move into at the beginning of the film. dismayed, anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she had discussed with declan earlier. when the alarm sounds, jeremy's instinct is to retrieve all of their electronic materials such as mobile phones, laptops, etc and shows no concern for anna's well-being. at that moment, anna fully realizes that there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including jeremy. meanwhile, back in dublin, declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiancee. sometime later, anna arrives back at caragh's tavern in dingle, where declan is running his seemingly successful business, having pulled together the balance he owed to his property owner with the help of the community. anna reveals to him that she has broken off her engagement to jeremy and tells declan that she has come to believe that all she needs/wants is right in dingle. when she proposes that they get together, ignoring her controlling nature and saying they should not make plans, declan leaves the room. thinking that she had been rejected, anna rushes outside and makes her way to the edge of a nearby cliff overlooking the sea. declan emerges, revealing that he went out simply to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring so that he could give it to her. taking her offer even further, declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. anna happily accepts, and they are later seen in declan's car, leaving their destination open to fate."

      "busy as she is as a boston stager, anna brady likes to control all aspects of her life. one of the few things she has not been able to control is getting married; her boyfriend, cardiologist dr. jeremy sloane, has not yet proposed to her after four years of dating. she hates the story told often to her by her father jack brady that there is an irish tradition that allows women to propose to their loved one on february 29, which is what purportedly got her paternal grandparents together. anna hates surprise herself, but she decides to surprise jeremy by showing up in dublin, where he is attending a conference, and proposing to him on leap day. but her trek from boston to dublin is anything but smooth. she gets stranded in dingle, her unintended entry into ireland, a few days before leap day. despite their antagonistic meeting, struggling pub/innkeeper declan o'callaghan agrees to drive anna to dublin... for a price; the agreed-upon fare would cover much of his debt, which would allow him to keep the pub/inn. largely because of their antagonism, anna, declan and their third, louis (what declan calls her louis vuitton suitcase), get into one misadventure after another, which threatens anna's arrival to dublin by february 29. through their time together, anna and declan might find that there are more important things in life than having that fairytale february 29 proposal and saving the pub/inn through extortion of anna.",

        "summary": "If everyone hates the film and it has a 4.1....why did it make so much money?!",
        "text": "I never had any intention of watching &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;) in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I&#39;m sorry but there&#39;s no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she&#39;s doing, hasn&#39;t prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she&#39;s drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he&#39;s not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He&#39;s incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says &quot;If you were mine, you wouldn&#39;t be able to sit down for a week&quot;. In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he&#39;d paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she&#39;ll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&amp;M relationship...and that&#39;s when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it&#39;s of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn&#39;t want to be close to anyone...and he doesn&#39;t even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.<br/><br/>What I find so bizarre about the whole &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN&#39;T any romance...and he doesn&#39;t want to date her. It&#39;s not so much just the S&amp;M aspects that I found bothersome...it&#39;s more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn&#39;t home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it&#39;s supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.<br/><br/>So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn&#39;t like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. <br/><br/>I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn&#39;t find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn&#39;t come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you&#39;d like...I just didn&#39;t particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull."

        "text": "Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E.L. James&#39; erotic bestseller &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot; director Sam Taylor-Johnston and &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot; scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James&#39; novel and turned it into an antiseptic, &quot;Cinderella&quot; fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; isn&#39;t as abysmal as the amateurish &quot;Addicted.&quot; Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both &quot;Shame&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Lover&quot; (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqué occurs until the concluding scene. You won&#39;t see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in &quot;Fatal Attraction,&quot; or the infamous &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James&#39; two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn&#39;t hoist anybody&#39;s eyebrows.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnston of &quot;The Five Year Engagement&quot;) is a shy, virginal, doe-eyed brunette who majors in English Lit at Washington State University and works at a hardware store. She shares an apartment with her best friend, blond-haired Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford of &quot;In the Blood&quot;), who serves as the campus newspaper editor. As the action unfolds, woebegone, pajama-clad Kate is wrestling with a cold. Kate persuades Anastasia to pinch hit for her on a newspaper assignment. She sends her out to interview bachelor billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan of &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;) who rules a colossal corporate empire. Basically, Christian is the Bruce Wayne of hanky-spanky. An orphan who survived the death of his crack-addict mom, Christian has amassed a fortune, but he harbors a deep, dark secret. When she enters &#39;The House of Grey,&#39; Anastasia knows little about him. Anxious about her assignment, Anastasia makes a klutz of herself when she enters Grey&#39;s office. No sooner has she crossed the threshold than she stumbles and crumples to her hands and knees. Realizing she hasn&#39;t made the best impression, Anastasia recovers her confidence and begins the interview. Initially, Christian adopts an icy attitude toward her, but he thaws out once they start talking. Christian finds the way Anastasia chews her lip so irresistible that he cancels his next appointment. Some of Kate&#39;s questions shock Anastasia, particularly when she quizzes the tycoon about his sexual orientation. A life-long bachelor who has never been photographed in public with a woman, Christian explains that he has little use for conventional romances with hearts and flowers. A relieved Anastasia leaves Christian behind in his phallic monolith of a building and cruises home. As it turns out, Anastasia is just as captivated with Christian as the latter is with her. Later, they go on a date, and eventually he deflowers her. He wants Anastasia to join him in a sexual liaison as a &#39;submissive&#39; to his &#39;dominant.&#39; Christian and she negotiate terms of a contract. For example, the open-minded Anastasia has no problems with being tied up and titillated with a peacock feather, but she draws the line at vaginal fisting and genital clamps. Meantime, Christian does everything he can to corrupt Anastasia, buying her a Mac notebook and replacing her classic Volkswagen Beetle with a shiny red Audi. Ultimately, Christian convinces our heroine to let him show her how bondage can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, Anastasia isn&#39;t as gullible as she seems. At fade-out, she gains the upper hand in their bizarre relationship.<br/><br/>The casting in &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; creates half of the problem. Dakota Johnson makes an ideal Anastasia. She gives a believable performance as a naïve college student who has just graduated and treasures the kind classic 19th century British fiction that Thomas Hardy wrote. The Austin, Texas, born actress seems wholly comfortable with her casual nudity, and it is interesting to note that &quot;Miami Vice&#39;s&quot; Don Johnson is her dad and Melanie Griffith of &quot;Something Wild&quot; is her mom. She isn&#39;t as goofy as her literary counterpart. Sadly, lean, handsome Jamie Dornan doesn&#39;t cut the mustard. He doesn&#39;t behave like a ruthless cutthroat who owns a billion dollar corporation, and his performance is considerably less spontaneous. Although he wears his apparel well and delivers his dialogue with crisp precision, Dornan looks more like a callow amateur. In all fairness to Dornan, he impersonates a character that doesn&#39;t seem remotely believable, and his lack of personality underlines his lightweight performance. The other big problem is the film seems as impersonal as a bargain basement torture rack. Basically, Johnston and Marcel have designed it as a bondage primer that cautiously advances from one elaborate interlude to another without drumming up any melodrama. Primarily, the filmmakers rely more on winks rather than winces as our heroine navigates the dire straits of Christian&#39;s sexual calisthenics. Keep in mind, Anastasia doesn&#39;t say no until she knows better. Gradually, Christian peels back the layers of his paranoia, revealing himself as an onion that initiates our heroine&#39;s tears and fears. When director Sam Johnston shifts the focus from the game of sexual chess between Anastasia and Christian, the film sacrifices suspense. Undeniably, &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; will keep your eyes wide open, but it dwells more on tease instead of sleaze."

They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.<br/><br/>This film is about two people who have no chemistry &quot;falling&quot; for each other. &quot;Falling&quot; like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I&#39;m just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.<br/><br/>Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you&#39;re in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter. <br/><br/>50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO."

James best-seller about a shy, timid virgin (Dakota Johnson) who meets the elusive billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Doman) and soon both of their lives change.<br/><br/>Writing a plot synopsis of this thing is pretty pointless since I&#39;m sure the target audience is already going to know the story. I guess this is where I should admit that I haven&#39;t read the book so this review won&#39;t be comparing the two or complaining about what the movie did or didn&#39;t do from the book. No, this review is just going to be based around the actual movie and for the life of me I can&#39;t see what all the hype is about. I don&#39;t expect everyone laying their money down to be some sort of film buff but the &quot;shocking&quot; material on display here has been going on in European movies for four-plus decades so why it&#39;s just now reaching American shores is pretty funny in itself but that&#39;s off subject I guess.<br/><br/>As for the film, there are all sorts of major issues with it but we can start with the laughable screenplay, which would have been rejected by the Lifetime channel and in fact, I&#39;m going to guess that it would have been rejected has a five-year-old written it. The dialogue is without question some of the most laughable I&#39;ve heard in a very long time. In fact, the movie seems to be lost in what decade it is because there are times that the &quot;F&quot; word is used and it&#39;s used in a way to where it&#39;s supposed to be shocking. Really? It&#39;s going to take more than that. The entire character development between the two lead characters is another joke and after a while you really can&#39;t buy into any of the melodrama and you&#39;ve just got to sit back and laugh.<br/><br/>The performances are another problem but then again, even the likes of Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor couldn&#39;t work with horrid material so I&#39;m not going to be too harsh on Johnson and Doman. With that said, the lackluster direction by Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn&#39;t help either as there are many times where another take should have happened. The scenes with Johnson playing the shy girl just aren&#39;t very believable because the actress can&#39;t sell it. The scenes of her explaining she&#39;s a virgin are laughably bad. Doman really doesn&#39;t get much to work with and especially since he can&#39;t crack a smile and has to give off dumb, overly-serious facial expressions throughout. I will say that the actors have a nice chemistry together but that&#39;s about it. The supporting players are all equally forgettable.<br/><br/>Yet another problem is that the film just isn&#39;t erotic. FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT and even something as silly as BODY OF EVIDENCE are just a few recent films that packed a lot more punch than this one. I mean, is sticking an eraser around your lips really erotic anymore? A lot of the lack of erotic-ness has to be blamed on the director who just seems to have been the wrong fit for the material. Nothing from the erotic nature to the serious stuff works and everything is poorly edited.<br/><br/>So, why the two-stars for all the negative stuff? As bad as the film is, thankfully it reaches the level to where you can&#39;t help but laugh and be mildly entertained as to what&#39;s going to happen next. Again, I haven&#39;t read the book so I don&#39;t know which one is better but the film is pretty flat from start to finish."

Christian, a 27-year-old telecommunications magnate and control-focused billionaire, takes a pronounced interest in Ana. He offers her an internship (which she declines), later visits the hardware store where she works, and arranges a photo shoot to accompany the article. After sending Ana first editions of Thomas Hardy novels (including Tess of the d'Urbervilles) and leaving a cryptic card, Christian pursues her with coffees and gifts. Ana, a romantic and inexperienced woman, is flattered and begins dating Christian. After Ana drunkenly calls him on graduation night, Christian finds her passed out in a bar and brings her to his hotel; they do not sleep together but share a charged kiss and begin a relationship.\n\nChristian requires Ana to sign a non-disclosure agreement and presents her with a formal contract that defines their sexual arrangement: Ana would be a submissive in a BDSM relationship, with sex confined to a designated “playroom” and specific rules and limits. Ana reveals she is a virgin; Christian takes care to make her first intercourse outside the bondage practices, then introduces her gradually to bondage (starting with a silk tie). Christian showers Ana with expensive gifts (a car, electronics) and attempts to control many aspects of their interactions. He tells her about his upbringing—adopted at four, emotionally guarded—and that he had a formative abusive/submissive relationship as a teenager. He also introduces Ana to his adoptive parents (Mr. and Mrs. Grey) and sister Mia.\n\nAna negotiates the contract, striking out clauses she cannot accept and securing one reserved date night a week. Christian asks Ana to try his sexual preferences before deciding; she agrees and experiences the “playroom” and bondage sessions. As their intimacy deepens, Ana becomes more unsettled by Christian's emotional distance and by the clinical, punitive elements of his expectations. Christian insists on maintaining strict control and demands obedience; he is reluctant to engage in typical romantic gestures. During a later visit to Ana's mother in Georgia, Christian impulsively appears, revealing his controlling impulses. Ana increasingly researches BDSM and submissive dynamics but remains conflicted.\n\nWhen Ana asks Christian to demonstrate how he would punish her for breaking rules, he lashes her backside six times with a belt while making her count—an act he frames as negotiation of limits but which traumatizes her. Disturbed by the physical punishment, Christian's coldness afterward, and the realization that he wants a relationship structured around control and pain rather than mutual emotional intimacy, Ana concludes their arrangement is unhealthy for her. She leaves Christian, ending the relationship.\n\nThe film closes on Ana's decision to walk away after recognizing that Christian's need for dominance, secrecy, and punishment makes him dangerous for any partner and that she cannot submit to a life defined by his terms.",

she wants romance rather than a purely generative union. christian wants ana to sign the contract, but she wants him to accept her as she is, and not try to change her.\nshe is shocked when christian unexpectedly arrives in georgia while she is visiting her mother. christian leaves soon after to tend to an emergency in seattle. after returning home, ana continues seeing christian, who is still interested in further venereal experimentation. ana initially consents and participates willingly. christian, however, keeps ana emotionally distant, upsetting her. christian is not willing to have a \"normal\" relationship with ana. while still considering the contract, ana asks christian to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule breaking. ana cannot understand why christian would have a need to hurt her in any way.\nchristian whips ana's backside six times with a belt, making her count each time he strikes her. she is upset and finds it far from her romantic expectations.\nana concludes that christian is wrong for her and that his practices border on being deviant and excessive and leaves."

        "text": "This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie&#39;s work. Branagh&#39;s portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.<br/><br/>A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.<br/><br/>There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile being the next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle, but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumbles upon them whenever he goes on vacation."

Then I thought, of all the titles, why go for such an obvious choice, which has been done several times.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film is undeniably beautiful, the costumes, sets, filming etc, the film will undoubtedly win an Oscar for the visuals. You can see big money was put into the look of the film.<br/><br/>My major irritation throughout, was his moustache, just absurdly over the top, when Depp and Pfeiffer should have been dominating scenes, all I could look at was that moustache. That apart Branagh was excellent, I never thought he&#39;d carry it off, but he did.<br/><br/>I am intrigued as to whether this is a one off film, or if there&#39;ll be the odd appearance on the big screen. Only time will tell.<br/><br/>All in all, it was good, I wanted and hoped to absolutely love it, unfortunately I didn&#39;t, but no way is it as bad as some say, too much quality for that.<br/><br/>7/10 (hoped for a perfect 10!)"

        "text": "There&#39;s a big problem with Kenneth Branagh&#39;s 2017 filming of the Hercule Poirot-based murder mystery. and that&#39;s the 1974 Sidney Lumet classic featuring Albert Finney in the starring role. For that film was so memorable – at least, the &quot;who&quot; of the &quot;whodunnit&quot; (no spoilers here) was so memorable – that any remake is likely to be tarnished by that knowledge. If you go into this film blissfully unaware of the plot, you are a lucky man/woman. For this is a classic Agatha Christie yarn.<br/><br/>The irascible, borderline OCD, but undeniably great Belgian detective, Poirot, is dragged around the world by grateful police forces to help solve unsolvable crimes. After solving a case in Jerusalem, Poirot is called back to the UK with his mode of transport being the famous Orient Express. Trapped in the mountains by an avalanche, a murder is committed and with multiple suspects and a plethora of clues it is up to Poirot to solve the case.<br/><br/>Branagh enjoys himself enormously as Poirot, sporting the most distractingly magnificent facial hair since Daniel Day-Lewis in &quot;The Gangs of New York&quot;. The moustache must have had its own trailer and make-up team!<br/><br/>Above all, the film is glorious to look at, featuring a rich and exotic colour palette that is reminiscent of the early colour films of the 40&#39;s. Cinematography was by Haris Zambarloukos (&quot;Mamma Mia&quot; and who also collaborated with Branagh on &quot;Thor) with lots of innovative &quot;ceiling down&quot; shots and artful point-of-view takes that might be annoying to some but which I consider as deserving of Oscar/BAFTA nominations.<br/><br/>The pictures are accompanied by a lush score by Patrick Doyle (who also scored Branagh&#39;s &quot;Thor&quot;). Hats off also to the special effects crew, who made the alpine bridge scenes look decidedly more alpine than where they were actually filmed (on a specially made bridge in the Surrey Hills!).<br/><br/>All these technical elements combine to make the film&#39;s early stages look and feel truly epic.<br/><br/>And the cast what a cast! Dame Judi Dench (&quot;Victoria and Abdul&quot;); Olivia Coleman (&quot;The Lobster&quot;); Johnny Depp (&quot;Black Mass&quot;); Daisy Ridley (&quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;); Penélope Cruz (&quot;Zoolander 2&quot;); Josh Gad (Olaf!); Derek Jacobi (&quot;I, Claudius&quot;); Willem Dafoe (&quot;The Great Wall&quot;) and Michelle Pfeiffer (&quot;mother!&quot;). A real case again of an &quot;oh, it&#39;s you&quot; film again at the cinema – when&#39;s the last time we saw that? <br/><br/>It&#39;s also great to see young Lucy Boynton, so magnificent in last year&#39;s excellent &quot;Sing Street&quot;, getting an A-list role as the twitchy and disturbed countess. <br/><br/>With all these ingredients in the pot, it should be great, right? Unfortunately, in my view, no, not quite. The film&#39;s opening momentum is really not maintained by the screenplay by Michael Green (&quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;; &quot;Logan&quot;). At heart, it&#39;s a fairly static and &quot;stagey&quot; piece at best, set as it is on the rather claustrophobic train (just three carriages on the Orient Express really?). But the tale is made even more static by the train&#39;s derailment in the snow. Branagh and Green try to sex up the action where they can, but there are lengthy passages of fairly repetitive dialogue. One encounter in particular between Branagh and Depp seems to last interminably: you wonder if the problem was that the director wasn&#39;t always looking on to yell &quot;Cut&quot;! <br/><br/>All this leads to the &quot;revelation&quot; of the murderer as being a bit of an anticlimactic &quot;thank heavens for that&quot; rather than the gasping denouement it should have been. (Perhaps this would be different if you didn&#39;t know the twist).<br/><br/>However, these reservations aside, it&#39;s an enjoyable night out at the flicks, although a bit of a disappointment from the level of expectation I had for it. I can&#39;t be too grumpy about it, given it&#39;s a return to good old-fashioned yarn-spinning at the cinema, with great visuals and an epic cast. And that has to be good news.<br/><br/>For sure, Branagh does make for an amusing and engaging Poirot, even if his dialogue did need some &#39;tuning in&#39; to. There was a suggestion at the end of the film that we might be seeing his return in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; – the most lush and decorous of Peter Ustinov&#39;s outings – which I would certainly welcome. He will have to find another 10 A- list stars though to decorate the boat, which will be a challenge for casting!"

Johnny Depp is pretty good as the victim, but even he seems a caricature. It is a star studded cast and that may have been a mistake. Branagh&#39;s Poirot is so dull. And that awful mustache. It looks like he glued on the bristles from a hair brush. The plot is confusing and there is little mystery. When I saw the first film, I knew the ending, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are several strange events that take place in this one. Poirot is way to brusque and unpleasant. My picture of him is a kind of shyness. The ending scene, where things are explained and the murderer revealed, is incredibly dull. Too much hoopla and not enough good direction."

        "text": "When was the last time Hollywood gave us a true old school style &quot;whodunit&quot; type of film? (Don&#39;t strain your brain here. You can take it as rhetorical.) These types of stories, where a detective is presented with a crime scene and figures it all out with just their intellect and powers of observation have always been a big part of my life. Trying to figure out the culprit before its eventual reveal was always challenging to me, and putting these stories on the big screen have kind of faded into the background. So, what do you do when you want to bring them back? Call Kenneth Branagh.<br/><br/>In his latest film, he brings to life one of the most famous detective novels in Agatha Christie&#39;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. He plays the famous (and infamous, depending on who you are) Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who is taking a bit of a vacation on his way to his next case on the famous Orient Express. Unfortunately, fate has its own plans for him as a murder most foul (I have always wanted to use that phrase in a review) happens during a snowstorm that derails the train. No one is seen by Poirot as innocent as he questions the passengers, follows the clues, and races against time to solve the case before the local authorities arrive and could accuse the wrong person of the murder.<br/><br/>OK, so let me run down the cast for you: Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr., Tom Bateman, Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, Olivia Coleman, Willem Defoe, and Dame Judi Dench. And yes, they are ALL in this thing, as well as Branagh, who also directed. Given all of that paired with the fact that this runs less than two hours, and I was intrigued on multiple levels. And trust me here: this film does not disappoint. Sure, there are some liberties taken from the source material, but none of them are so far out of the norm that will drive the fans of any previous iterations of this story. Branagh is truly enjoyable as the character who is a genius but has his own issues that actually enhance his powers of observation, and his direction is top-notch here. This is gorgeously shot, including a few shots where there is a nod to the old ways of effects, giving a tighter and more nostalgic feel to the modern telling of this tale.<br/><br/>The performances here are exactly what I expected from a cast of this caliber. With a story that has been around as long as &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; has been (the book was written in 1934), there is a bit of a minefield when it comes to bringing it to life that could easily fall down the slope into parody or cariacature, but diverse screenwriter Michael Green, whose resume covers everything from &quot;Green Lantern&quot; to &quot;Everwood&quot; and even &quot;Logan,&quot; is able to write dialogue that lets the actors really get into the skins of these characters to treat them with the proper respect and dignity. Yes, there ARE a few liberties taken with the characters themselves, but there was nothing done that gave me even a little bit of growling. Each character has its own arc and motivations that work into the larger picture in a way that is engaging with no wasted space at all.<br/><br/>There will be people that will find this film to be a bit outlandish, but I feel that those people are those that have not taken the time to really study the genre. Not every film has to dumb itself down to cater to the lowest common denominator, and I really enjoy it when a film tells me to engage my suspension of disbelief and simply entertain me. For great escapism and a reminder of a simpler time, &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; achieves this goal for an audience that can truly appreciate its greatness."

      "plot_summary": "In 1934 Hercule Poirot, a famed Belgian detective, solves a theft in Jerusalem then travels toward London via the Simplon Orient Express after his friend Bouc (a director at the train company) secures him a berth. On the train Poirot is offered by businessman Samuel Ratchett (who later is identified as John Cassetti) to be his bodyguard; Poirot refuses. That night Poirot hears noises from Ratchett's compartment and sees someone in a red kimono in the corridor. An avalanche derails and stalls the train in Yugoslavia, trapping the first-class passengers. The next morning Ratchett is found stabbed to death multiple times in his locked cabin. Bouc and Poirot begin an investigation while local authorities await the train being freed. Evidence collected: Ratchett's coffee was drugged; a button from a conductor's uniform and a bloodstained handkerchief are found in Mrs. Hubbard's compartment; a torn, partially burned note links Ratchett to the 1929 kidnapping and murder of Daisy Armstrong; a red kimono and a conductor's uniform are discovered; Mrs. Hubbard (Caroline Hubbard) is stabbed but survives and later is revealed to be Linda Arden, Daisy's grandmother. Poirot interviews each passenger: Hector MacQueen (Ratchett's secretary), Edward Henry Masterman (Ratchett's valet), Colonel John Arbuthnot, Mary Debenham (governess), Count and Countess Andrenyi (the Countess later identified as Helena Goldenberg), Princess Natalia Dragomiroff, Greta Ohlsson (nurse), Pilar Estravados (nurse), Antonio Foscarelli (chauffeur), Pierre Michel (conductor), Cyrus Hardman (private detective), and Fräulein Hildegarde Schmidt (maid). Poirot uncovers that Ratchett is actually John Cassetti, the kidnapper of Daisy Armstrong whose crime destroyed the Armstrong family: Sonia Armstrong died after premature labor, Colonel Armstrong later killed himself, the Armstrong maid Susanne was arrested and hanged herself in custody, and many relatives and associates were ruined. Poirot finds that many passengers have direct connections to the Armstrongs or to Susanne: Masterman had served Colonel Armstrong; MacQueen's father was the district attorney on the case; Princess Dragomiroff and Linda Arden are family friends/relatives; the Countess is Sonia's sister; Michel is Susanne's grieving father; Hardman loved Susanne; Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess; Foscarelli was the family chauffeur; Greta and Pilar cared for Daisy. Poirot also discovers attempts to fabricate evidence (burned ledgers, tampered passports) and that several items were planted to suggest an external killer. When Colonel Arbuthnot later storms the compartment and shoots at Poirot, he reveals he never intended to kill Poirot but to force a confession. Poirot assembles the passengers and offers two solutions to the Yugoslavian police: (1) a lone assassin boarded the train disguised as a conductor and escaped; or (2) the more complex truth—that all thirteen implicated passengers and the conductor participated in a planned collective murder of Cassetti, each taking turns stabbing him to avenge Daisy Armstrong and the harm done to her family. Mrs. Hubbard admits she organized the meeting and planned the murder; the group confirms their motives and actions. Poirot exposes that the gun presented to him was unloaded to test reactions and that Arbuthnot’s staged shooting was meant to demonstrate the conspirators' resolve. Bouc and Poirot agree on a course of action: present the lone killer story to the authorities so the passengers can go free. Poirot, who prides himself on truth and balance, is forced to live with this moral compromise because he judges Cassetti deserved death. The train resumes; the suspects disperse and are allowed to leave. As Poirot disembarks a messenger asks him to investigate a death in Egypt (Death on the Nile), and he accepts.",

      "in 1934, famous detective hercule poirot (kenneth branagh) solves a theft at the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem. the obsessive compulsive belgian-who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth a curse-wants to rest in istanbul but must return to london for another case. his friend bouc (tom bateman), director of the orient express, offers him a room on the train. poirot refuses businessman samuel ratchett's (johnny depp) offer to hire him as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, as ratchett has received threatening letters from an unknown party. that night poirot hears strange noises coming from ratchett's compartment, and sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. an avalanche derails the train and strands the passengers.\nthe next morning poirot learns ratchett was murdered during the night after being stabbed a dozen times. poirot and bouc investigate passengers as repairs begin. evidence indicates that ratchett was murdered by one person, with caroline hubbard (michelle pfeiffer) claiming that a man was in her compartment during the night and that since her cabin was next to ratchett, the murderer would have entered ratchett's cabin through hers.\npoirot discovers a partially destroyed note connecting ratchett to the kidnapping of daisy armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. after the ransom was paid, daisy was found murdered. ratchett is identified as john cassetti, daisy's kidnapper and murderer. her death caused her mother sonia (miranda raison) to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, colonel armstrong, then committed suicide. the family's nursemaid susanne was arrested and hanged herself while in police custody, but exonerated after her death.\nthe train compartments were locked at night, so the only suspects were the people in that particular compartment. also that compartment had a guard who said he saw nobody enter ratchett's cabin during the time of his death. ratchett's coffee is found to be drugged, but his valet henry does not know how the coffee was drugged before or after he delivered it to ratchett.\nthen poirot finds hector trying to burn the ledgers of ratchett's accounts. poirot stops him and accuses him of stealing from ratchett and hence killing him for the fear of being found out. but dr artbutnot confirms that hector was drinking with him all night. more evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief and the button of a conductor's uniform found in hubbard's compartment. the uniform is later found, as is the kimono, discovered in poirot's own suitcase. hubbard is stabbed in the back; she survives but cannot identify the culprit. poirot discovers several of the passengers have direct connections to the armstrong family. while interviewing governess mary debenham (daisy ridley), john arbuthnot (leslie odom jr.) shoots poirot in the shoulder claiming that he is the murderer, but is stopped by bouc. poirot realizes that arbuthnot-a medical doctor and former army sniper-never meant to kill him.\npoirot then interview count and countess andrenyi. he finds that countess's passport has been tampered and deduces that her first name is not elena, but helena. he then deduces that helena is in fact the sister of sonia armstrong, who is living in permanent fear from the events of the past. poirot meets the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how ratchett died. the first is simple: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train, murdered ratchett, and fled. the second is more complex: every suspect is connected to the armstrongs, susanne, or her trial in some way-including those who had pretended otherwise-and had motive to kill ratchett/cassetti. hubbard is revealed to be linda arden, former stage actress and sonia armstrong's mother.\npoirot reveals that the 13 other passengers on the train, and the train conductor, were all connected to the armstrong family in some way:\nhector willard macqueen (josh gad), ratchett/cassetti's secretary was devoted to sonia armstrong. macqueen's father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case. he knew from his father the details of cassetti's escape from justice and intended to kill ratchett. hector's father was pressured to go after the maid on flimsy evidence. the maid later killed herself and then the evidence turned towards casetti. hector's father was pilloried for this.\nedward henry masterman (derek jacobi), ratchett/cassetti's valet, was colonel armstrong's batman during the war, and later his valet, who also acted as butler to the armstrong household.\ncolonel arbuthnot was colonel armstrong's comrade and best friend.\nmrs. hubbard is, in actuality, linda arden (maiden name goldenberg), the most famous tragic actress of the new york stage, and was sonia armstrong's mother and daisy's grandmother.\ncountess andrenyi (née helena goldenberg) (lucy boynton) was sonia armstrong's sister.\ncount andryeni (sergei polunin) was the husband of helena andrenyi.\nprincess natalia dragomiroff (judi dench) was sonia armstrong's godmother, and a friend of her mother.\nmiss mary debenham was sonia armstrong's secretary and daisy armstrong's governess.\nfräulein hildegarde schmidt (olivia colman), princess dragomiroff's maid, was the armstrong family's cook.\nantonio foscarelli, a car salesman based in chicago, was the armstrong family's chauffeur.\nmiss greta ohlsson, a swedish missionary, was daisy armstrong's nurse.\npierre michel (marwan kenzari), the train conductor, was the father of susanne, the armstrong's nursemaid who committed suicide.\ncyrus hardman (willem dafoe), a private detective ostensibly retained as a bodyguard by ratchett/cassetti, was a policeman in love with susanne.\npilar estravados (penélope cruz) was daisy's nurse and has now turned to religion and service of god.\nmanuel garcia-rulfo as biniamino marquez hubbard admits that she gathered everyone and planned the murder. all of the suspects took turns stabbing ratchett. arbuthnot stabbed hubbard without endangering her life to convince poirot of a lone killer. poirot challenges the passengers to shoot him with his gun since he is the only one who can expose their plot; bouc can lie but poirot-obsessed with truth and balance-cannot. hubbard grabs the gun and tries to kill herself. the gun is unloaded; poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.\nas the train is put back on track poirot concludes that justice is impossible in the case, as ratchett deserved death; for the first time he will have to live with a lie and imbalance. poirot presents the lone killer theory to the yugoslavian police, allowing the suspects to leave. as he disembarks the train a messenger asks him to investigate a death on the nile. poirot takes the case."

In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?<br/><br/>One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn&#39;t matter. And that my kids don&#39;t matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don&#39;t matter.<br/><br/>Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don&#39;t matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.<br/><br/>The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.<br/><br/>I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can&#39;t keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.<br/><br/>Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies).<br/><br/>Grade: A."

From the short time I spent in China, it&#39;s also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents &#39;cause they really do be like that. I can&#39;t recommend it enough, it&#39;s so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it&#39;s unique on it&#39;s own and I&#39;m glad it was released earlier so that people don&#39;t compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this.

If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we&#39;ve got.<br/><br/>Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel&#39;s character was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it&#39;s all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It&#39;s one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart."

It&#39;s bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.<br/><br/>These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.<br/><br/>As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It&#39;s such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.<br/><br/>All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of originality.

        "text": "Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you&#39;re walking on an acid trip experience. It&#39;s an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.<br/><br/>And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick &amp; Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!<br/><br/>Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it&#39;s such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What&#39;s even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.<br/><br/>This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It&#39;s fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there&#39;s just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.<br/><br/>EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.<br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she&#39;s fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she&#39;s doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It&#39;s not easy to play her role and it&#39;s definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.<br/><br/>There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you&#39;re forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it&#39;s just funny you&#39;re having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it&#39;s aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you&#39;re watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you&#39;re watching. You&#39;ll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!<br/><br/>If there&#39;s one dislike from this film is that it&#39;s gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.<br/><br/>Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We&#39;re only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!"

        "text": "2022 is not even halfway over, but I saw Everything, Everywhere last night, and I simply cannot imagine it not being the best film of 2022.<br/><br/>To say I was stunned is an understatement. I am 37 years old and have been a movie buff since I was a child. Movies are my passion - classic cinema, international cinema, domestic cinema. I see at least 30+ movies in theaters every year from all counties and compile a top 10 list of my favorite films.<br/><br/>I can count on both hands the number of times I have sat in a movie theater slackjawed and stunned, unable to move as credits rolled on a film. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to not only me but the audience with whom I&#39;ve watched a movie. I have also only seen a few movies where the audience erupted in applause during the credits - rapturous, earnest, sustained cheering.<br/><br/>Last night&#39;s screening of Everything, Everywhere falls into the latter category. As credits rolled, no one moved in a sold-out IMAX theater. We all sat and stared at the screen in awe before eventually cheering and clapping.<br/><br/>This is a special movie, a miracle of a film, the type of lightning-in-a-bottle motion picture that comes along once in a blue moon to blow your mind and annihilate your heart with its boundless, bursting soul, energy, spirit, and creativity.<br/><br/>In all my movie-watching years, I have never seen anything like it. The closest comparison I can muster is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are many similarities between both films&#39; unhinged, creative expression as well as their ultimate message of persistence and living life in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds and the inevitably that all things, both good and bad, will eventually come to a crashing end when the curtains on our lives close.<br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh is remarkable and delivers a knockout performance that will surely garner plenty of awards attention. It&#39;s hard to imagine many actresses who could have so effortlessly kept step with such a demanding role, but she coasts through drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi with a verve and energy that left me breathless. It&#39;s the fiercest performance I&#39;ve seen from one of the best actresses of our time and one of the best performances I&#39;ve seen in years.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, really the less you know going in, the better. I saw the trailer two or three times prior to watching the film, and it did little to spoil the experience. I really do recommend going in blind, though.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t rate many movies a 10/10. I also rarely leave theaters feeling the way I felt last night: dizzy on the possibilities of cinema and lost in thought over all I had just experienced. Even as I write this, I cannot wait to see the movie again with new people so they can experience just how special this is.<br/><br/>Everything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won&#39;t be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.<br/><br/>Quite the contrary, really. When the dust settles by the end of the film, you feel like you have been taken somewhere new - to a place only the best films can take us - and are reminded that even though we might not matter in the grand scheme of the universe, there are kind things we can do - to one another and ourselves - to make the pain and joy of being human mean...something.<br/><br/>And at the end of the day, maybe that&#39;s everything."

Waymond secretly prepares divorce papers to force a conversation; their adult daughter Joy is estranged, depressed, and in a relationship with Becky, which Evelyn struggles to accept. Evelyn's demanding father (Gong Gong) arrives from China for Chinese New Year, increasing pressure. During a fraught audit meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, an alternate-reality version of Waymond (Alpha‑Waymond) suddenly takes over Waymond's body and informs Evelyn that countless parallel universes exist and that Jobu Tupaki — a splintered, omnipotent version of Evelyn's daughter (Alpha‑Joy) — is threatening the multiverse. Alpha‑Waymond gives Evelyn “verse-jumping” technology that lets her access skills and memories of her alternate selves by performing bizarre actions.\n\nAs Evelyn verse-jumps, she discovers lives she could have lived (a kung-fu star, a chef, a wealthy and confident Evelyn) and begins manifesting those abilities in her primary body. Jobu Tupaki, who experiences every universe simultaneously and created an ‘everything bagel’ singularity capable of destroying the multiverse, sends minions and corrupted versions of people (including an alternate Deirdre and Alpha‑Gong Gong) to capture Evelyn. Alpha‑Waymond believes this Evelyn — whom other alphas call a ‘failure’ — has latent potential to stop Jobu. Alpha‑Gong Gong, convinced extreme measures are needed, instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to prevent Jobu from using her as a conduit; Evelyn refuses.\n\nEvelyn escalates verse-jumping to match Jobu's power. Jobu kills Alpha‑Waymond in the alphaverse and confronts Evelyn in Evelyn’s universe, showing her the everything bagel and preaching that nothing matters. Evelyn briefly succumbs to nihilism: in several jumped realities she behaves cruelly (she signs the divorce papers, destroys the laundromat, hurts loved ones) and nearly enters the bagel with Jobu. In Evelyn’s home world, Waymond persistently appeals to ordinary kindness and connection; his simple plea for people to be kinder and more patient snaps Evelyn back. She rejects Jobu's annihilation, reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky, and tells Gong Gong the truth about Joy’s relationship. Evelyn uses verse-jumping not to copy Jobu's nihilism but to bring empathy into fights — pulling compassionate memories and small, specific skills from other selves — which undoes damage across universes and neutralizes Jobu’s allies (including Alpha‑Gong Gong and the minions).\n\nJoy, anguished, attempts to join Jobu in the bagel; Evelyn refuses to sacrifice her and instead reaches Joy with a promise that even if nothing makes sense, she chooses to be with her. Together they rescue Jobu from the bagel; Jobu, confronted with care and connection, ceases her campaign. The family repairs relationships: Evelyn, Waymond, Joy, Gong Gong, and even Deirdre return to finalize the IRS audit and refile taxes. Evelyn remains aware of other selves but grounds herself in her life, choosing patience, love, and small acts of kindness over nihilism. The film ends with the family reconciled and Evelyn present in her original universe.",

      "evelyn quan wang (michelle yeoh) is a middle-aged chinese american immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, waymond (ke huy quan); two decades earlier, they eloped to the united states and had a daughter, joy (stephanie hsu). in the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the internal revenue service (irs); waymond is trying to serve evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as gong gong (james hong), cantonese for 'grandfather') is visiting for her chinese new year party; and joy is dealing with depression and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes evelyn's reluctance to accept joy's lesbian relationship with her non-chinese girlfriend becky (tallie medel). at a tense meeting with irs inspector deirdre beaubeirdre (jamie lee curtis), waymond's body is taken over by alpha-waymond, a version of waymond from the \"alphaverse.\" alpha-waymond explains to evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. the alphaverse, led by the late alpha-evelyn, developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. the multiverse is threatened by jobu tupaki (alpha-joy), whose mind was splintered after alpha-evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. she has created a black hole-like \"everything bagel\" topped with everything, which appears as a toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse. alpha-evelyn made it the task of the alpha-verse to find the one who can stand up to jobu tupaki.\nwhile evelyn goes into a different universe, her body in the original universe stays, but her mind is not there. this happens during the audit meeting with deirdre and the meeting is not going well. she says evelyn is charging her hobbies as business expenses, and can be charged for fraud, or will have to pay a fine. in her confusion evelyn strikes deirdre during the audit who calls security. alpha-waymond appears again inside waymond's body and helps evelyn escape.\nthey are still trapped inside the irs building as dierdre from a tetra-verse appears inside dierdre's body and blocks their path. evelyn is given verse-jumping technology by alpha-waymond to fight jobu's minions, who converge on the irs building. she discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star; she also learns of waymond's plans with the divorce papers. evelyn uses her powers to defeat alpha-dierdre and the other minions. jobu tupaki directs all the minions to the irs building in the original evelyn's universe when she senses that evelyn has started gaining powers.\nalpha-waymond believes that evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat jobu. gong gong is taken over by alpha-gong gong, who instructs evelyn to kill joy to stop jobu from using her to enter evelyn's universe.\nevelyn refuses and decides to face jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. evelyn believes that the only way to defeat jobu tupaki is to become like her.\nalpha-gong gong, convinced that evelyn's mind has been compromised like jobu's, sends soldiers after evelyn. while they fight, jobu locates and kills alpha-waymond in the alphaverse. as jobu confronts evelyn in her universe (she shows evelyn the real bagel black hole and tells her that the real truth is that nothing matters), evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses. evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the evelyns that do not agree with her. she brings evelyn to the everything bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and evelyn to truly die. upon looking into the bagel, evelyn is initially persuaded, and acts cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her (she even signs the divorce papers with waymond and proceeds to destroy her own laundromat). as evelyn is about to enter the bagel with jobu, she pauses to listen to waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. in her home universe, evelyn reconciles with waymond, accepts joy and becky's relationship and tells gong gong of it, and talks with deirdre after waymond convinces deirdre to let them redo their taxes\nevelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow waymond's absurdist and humanist advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy and brings happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes alpha-gong gong and jobu's fighters.\njobu decides to enter the bagel alone while, simultaneously in evelyn's universe, joy begs evelyn to let her go. evelyn tells joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with joy. evelyn and the others save jobu from the bagel, and evelyn and joy embrace. some time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the irs building to refile their taxes. as deirdre talks, evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe."

      "evelyn wang is going through the motions of life in trying to achieve some sort of fulfillment, which she may or may not admit to herself has, so far, been unsuccessful at almost any level. she and her husband, waymond wang, own and operate a laundromat, and while she loved him when they were first married - marrying him against the advice of her judgmental father's - she now feels that he is a weak man whose messes she has to fix. on the flip side, she has no idea that he has had papers drawn for divorce, or that he only plans on going through with it as a last resort if things between them don't improve. she feels she has never really had the love or respect of her father - whom she ran away from as a young adult - and now he has come from asia to the us to live with her and waymond. evelyn and waymond's only offspring, young adult joy wang, has turned into a version of her by pulling away, not feeling any love or getting any respect, and as such, being aimless in life. what may be the pinnacle of the mother/daughter problems is that joy has not only brought her girlfriend becky into their lives - how to explain becky to her father and others like him; the biggest issue in the same sex vein - but becky is also white. conversely, evelyn's life could have been so much more if she made different choices or followed through with any of the many other things she started. on top of preparing for a chinese new year's eve party under the pressure of trying to meet the exacting standards of her father, she and waymond are also in the middle of an irs audit by their auditor, hard-nosed deirdre beaubeirdre. as evelyn and waymond enter into what is supposed to be their final \"show me the proper paperwork or else\" meeting with deirdre, evelyn physically and metaphysically enters into alternate universes, where she not only has to make the right choices to save the collective universe, but arguably more importantly, come to a true understanding of herself.",
      "evelyn wang and her husband, waymond, run a laundromat. times are tough, and they're in trouble with the internal revenue service. there's also some fuss with their daughter, and evelyn's father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. and now, waymond wants a divorce. could things have turned out differently for evelyn--maybe in a parallel universe?",
      "a middle-aged chinese laundromat owner must get in touch with her other selves who are scattered across the multiverse. this woman is the key to saving reality itself, but she can't do it alone; her family's fate is intertwined with the fate of the multiverse too."

        "summary": "A Delightfully Offbeat Comic Book Comedy",
        "text": "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we&#39;ll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It&#39;s unlike anything I&#39;d seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.<br/><br/>Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He&#39;s socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He&#39;s in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they&#39;re really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, &quot;Knives&quot; who&#39;s only 17- kind of a big deal when he&#39;s 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she&#39;s real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she&#39;s the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they&#39;re soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex&#39;s. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there&#39;s the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!<br/><br/>That&#39;s the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I&#39;d have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex&#39;s has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that&#39;s the whole point.<br/><br/>The movie&#39;s humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters&#39; reactions to them. After one of the ex&#39;s has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don&#39;t act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.<br/><br/>Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she&#39;s never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face &quot;It&#39;s okay, neither have I.&quot; Or the band&#39;s self-introduction, &quot;We&#39;re the Sex Bob-Ombs and we&#39;re here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.<br/><br/>The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott&#39;s roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott&#39;s amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.<br/><br/>The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can&#39;t think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars."

        "summary": "Wildly creative and fun...but probably NOT for all tastes...",
        "text": "&quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; is one of the most creative, fresh and original films I have seen in ages, and because of that I was in absolute awe of the film. However, despite being a terrific film, I also understand that this is NOT a film that will appeal to everyone--in fact, it&#39;s probably one of the more polarizing films I have ever seen--you&#39;ll probably either love it or hate it. While I am NOT in the target demographic group (aged 15-30 and predisposed to loving graphic novels AND video games), I did enjoy it--and am probably the rare 40-something person who loved the film. What was different about me is that I am a geek (a definite plus), enjoy video games and have a rabid comic book fan for a daughter--so I understood many of the pop culture references throughout the film. But, if you are NOT a geek, hate video games and see graphic novels more as comic books, then the movie might be a chore to watch. Plus you might just feel ooky hanging out with geeks. Don&#39;t worry, they are almost all very nice people! <br/><br/>So what, other than originality, did I love about this film? Well, just about everything--and I seriously considered giving the film a 10--I liked it that much. Perhaps the best thing for me was casting of Michael Cera in the lead. Unlike the traditional super-hero, he is by far the geekiest and most likable main character I have seen. Seeing such a wimpy and unassuming guy become, out of no where, like a character from Mortal Combat was a wonderful juxtaposition--you just couldn&#39;t help but smile. And, despite his nerdy looks, he was winning as Scott Pilgram...and actually played the music his on-screen band played--now that&#39;s talent. Additionally, I loved the film&#39;s gentle sense of humor---I laughed harder at this film than any film I&#39;ve seen in the theater in some time. I could try to describe these moments--you just need to see them for yourself. Odd references to games like DOA, Mortal Combat, Marvel Vs. Capcom and Zelda II were great--I caught on to those due to my own geeky background. And, my familiarity with anime/manga also made me laugh--as the hair, love for girls in school uniforms and style were often straight out of Japanese comics. And, I loved how the film made me love video games and was simply much, much more fun that the original &quot;Tron&quot; (which I always felt was too dry--perhaps the new version will correct this).<br/><br/>Clever, wonderful and strange, this film is the geek&#39;s dream come true...and not a film to be missed. However, if you aren&#39;t a geek or are perhaps too old to get the pop references, I say take along an interpreter--many comic book nerds and couch potatoes would be glad to go with you and help explain things...provided you pay for the tickets.<br/><br/>Among the nearly 9000 reviews I have now done on IMDb, this ranks in the hallowed ranks of a very small group of movies that transcended the pack due to its utter weirdness. It&#39;s surreal and weird--and I think this makes it very special. For other films that fall into this category, try &quot;The Happiness of the Katikuris&quot;, &quot;Delicatessen&quot;, &quot;Yes Nurse, No Nurse&quot;, &quot;Tatie Danielle&quot; and &quot;Tampopo&quot;--all truly unique, surreal and fabulous films."

        "text": "Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona&#39;s love against her seven exes.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott&#39;s fights against Ramona&#39;s exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.<br/><br/>All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott&#39;s confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott&#39;s sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.<br/><br/>The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera&#39;s movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott&#39;s rock band and the techno Asian twins band.<br/><br/>The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you&#39;ve seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made."

After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night&#39;s Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something&#39;s life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.<br/><br/>While the audience might&#39;ve been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there&#39;s no denying that it&#39;s an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it&#39;s looking for laughs.<br/><br/>I can&#39;t imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I&#39;ve seen in years. Don&#39;t hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you."

Deep in its heart its just a hip, flashy teen romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright better known as the director of the Cornetto Trilogy adapts this comic book series like it was an edgy fast paced pseudo Japanese video game.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) plays bass in his garage rock band Sex Bob-omb who meets his dream girl Ramona Flowers (Elizabeth Mary Winstead) who is new in town. However he is soon pursued by Ramona&#39;s seven evil exes who all challenge Scott Pilgrim to a duel and Scott needs to keep them in check with his zaps and zingers Streetfighter style.<br/><br/>Cera has the right balance of geeky, slacker dude, Canadian hipster charm as Scott Pilgrim who is very likable even though he quickly ditched High School student Knives for Ramona.<br/><br/>The Evil Exes are a colourful bunch with some star names amongst them. Chris Evans is a skateboarding movie star whose entrance is accompanied with the Universal Pictures theme tune. Jason Schwartzman is a megalomaniac record producer. Brandon Routh is a pretentious vegan rock star with the ability to fly just like Superman.<br/><br/>There is a lot of scene stealing in this film like Kieran Culkin as Scott&#39;s sneaky gay roommate, Anna Kendrick as Scott&#39;s sister and particularly Ellen Wong as Knives the slightly too young ditched girlfriend who is still loyal to Scott.<br/><br/>I actually found this to be a fast moving, quirky, rocking, enjoyable comedy drama."

He quickly finds out this dream girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is actually quite real, and decides to pursue her. But before they can truly become the couple Scott hopes for, he has to defeat her seven evil exes.<br/><br/>I did not think it was possible, but Edgar Wright has fairly successfully brought Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley&#39;s epic graphic novel series to the big screen in the most uniquely entertaining way possible. It is his first adapted work, but it feels every bit as fresh (I use that word very loosely) as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did upon their initial releases. It deviates from the books a bit (much like Matthew Vaughn&#39;s excellent adaptation of Kick-Ass earlier this year), but the majority of the film stays true to the series and gives the fans everything they might expect from a Scott Pilgrim film. Right after the film opening with an 8-bit Universal logo and score, you know you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>What propels Wright&#39;s epic and inspired vision is the editing style. All of the little idiosyncrasies, background/foreground items and ideas, everything that made O&#39;Malley&#39;s books so revered in the graphic novel community are all in full force here. Some shots in the trailers suggest the comic book-style feel of the film, with the sounds of the actions appearing as words on-screen and the video game-related pop-ups appearing the same way they would in the game. But that is only the start. The entire film is filled with them, and with references to numerous pop culture entities (specifically video games), to the point that it looks and sounds like a ridiculously enhanced motion comic or game. Add to that the quick cuts and multiple panel style of the format, and you have the closest film representation of a comic since Robert Rodriguez attacked Frank Miller&#39;s Sin City.<br/><br/>Even with all the nods and references to the original work, Wright&#39;s film still feels very much his own work. He makes Scott Pilgrim&#39;s epic quest to defeat Ramona&#39;s exes into an understated work you will likely not see replicated too soon. After seeing Christopher Nolan&#39;s Inception just under a week ago, I did not think that mainstream Hollywood would release something so blazingly original and something so astonishly unique so close together. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is not nearly as strong a film as Nolan&#39;s masterpiece is, but Wright has clearly given it his all here. He has sidestepped away from following the lead of other comic book/graphic novel-style films, and has created something he can truly be proud of. The visuals on display are simply remarkable, and are worth the price of a ticket all on their own. The musical choices are even better. If you have seen the trailers, you are merely only getting a hint for what Wright has in store for you here.<br/><br/>If I do have an issue, it is that the film is a little too exposition-heavy in the first half, and way too jumpy in the second. It never loses its tone or its style, but it becomes all too blatantly obvious where the books stop and the deviation begins. The pacing here is also a touch off, and on further research, thoroughly suggests there is material missing or altered from the final cut of the film. I understand that Wright and his co-writer Michael Bacall wanted to set-up the story and where it plans on going for the few who venture into the film without having read a single issue, but there is too much detail given in those early scenes, and not enough to pivotal moments later in the film.<br/><br/>Another gripe, although it is one I hope will be less bothersome on repeat viewings, is that a good chunk of the characters feel incredibly underused. The books are stacked to the brim with an eclectic mix of supporting characters, who are present in the film, but they feel very stunted and get absolutely no development. Kim Pine (Alison Pill) is a very important character in the books, but she merely appears in the background here and delivers some of the best dialogue. Wallace Wells (the absolutely incredible scene-stealer Kieran Culkin) is the moral centre and source of an incredible amount of exposition, but he is barely in the film after the first half. Envy Adams (Brie Larson) almost feels like an extended cameo as opposed to an indispensible figure in Scott&#39;s character development. But then, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and especially Jason Schwartzman all deliver stunning performances as three of Ramona&#39;s exes, despite the lack of time on-screen.<br/><br/>Cera on the other hand, is perfect as Pilgrim. The character plays a little too close to his stereotypical neurotic and off-centre archetype, but it works out beautifully here. He makes the character real, and brings a depth to Scott Pilgrim that no other young actor could. He has the right look and the right sound down pat. It was a little weird to see him get so physical in some sequences, but this is a vintage fit for Cera. Although they are downplayed more than I liked, Winstead and Wong are great as Ramona and Knives. They both have a certain edge throughout the film, and even at its most ridiculous, deliver strong performances. It helps too that they have insanely good chemistry with Cera.<br/><br/>I jumped at the idea of an advanced screening of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and I do not regret seeing the film in the slightest. It is a bit of a niche movie, but it is one that is lovingly made through and through.<br/><br/>8/10.<br/><br/>(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."

He is self-absorbed and willing to abandon Knives as soon as he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Before Scott can date Ramona, he must defeat her seven exes.<br/><br/>Scott is a douche. The biggest problem for me is his unlikeability. It runs counter to Cera&#39;s usual good guy persona. Everybody is blasé and sarcastic which get some good laughs.<br/><br/>The best thing about this is the 80s video game visual motif. Edgar Wright brings a fresh hip-without-the-irony sensibility. It also uses Toronto not as New York or as anything other than Toronto. It&#39;s refreshing and unique in a world where almost everything is a sequel."

        "text": "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has made me question just how well I fit in with my generation. According to other members of my generation, it is the movie to end all movies, and the best movie... I&#39;m sorry... most EPIC movie ever. I&#39;m partial to The Godfather myself. Scott Pilgrim is a film that I was looking forward to as Michael Cera has made me laugh numerous times in the past, and Edgar Wright is easily one of the more talented newer directors working today. Combined with the eye-popping visual effects, I couldn&#39;t see how these things could add up to anything less than a fun and entertaining film. Fun, to a point. Entertaining? Well...<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim&#39;s first problem is the plot. The plot is self-conscious and repetitive, as well as overly laid back and easygoing. Scott Pilgrim has to defeat his new girlfriend&#39;s seven evil ex&#39;s. That&#39;s the whole plot, and at no point do we get the sense that anything is at stake for these characters. I know that probably shouldn&#39;t matter in an effects-driven popcorn movie, but with nothing to root for, or no suspense of any kind, I found the film to get boring after the first thirty minutes. That is approximately when the first evil ex shows up. They fight. He defeats him easily. Too easily. The fight isn&#39;t all that exciting as a result. And with six of these to go, the movie became a tedious experience before it was even halfway over.<br/><br/>Not to say the film doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s good points. Michael Cera, though not as witty as he can be, is still somewhat likable. And while the script lacks structure of any kind, it is jam- packed with hilariously quirky dialogue and brilliant sight gags. The filmmaking is generally good throughout, and as a director Edgar Wright hasn&#39;t lost his talent. Unfortunately, the poor storyline ultimately overshadowed these elements for me. <br/><br/>Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t play video games. Maybe I just need to read the comics. Or maybe I&#39;m just becoming less fun of a person as I mature. I want to like this movie and take the same joy from it that my generation does, but I simply can&#39;t. I&#39;ll stick to films with stories and social relevance and enjoy being the outcast. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets a generous 5/10 because I feel giving it anything lower would just make me look bitter."

      "plot_summary": "In Toronto, 22-year-old Scott Pilgrim is the bass player for garage band Sex Bob-Omb and is dating 17-year-old high-school student Knives Chau. Scott is still reeling from being dumped by ex Natalie \"Envy\" Adams. One night Scott sees American delivery girl Ramona Flowers and becomes obsessed. He begins courting Ramona while still nominally dating Knives; his friends Wallace Wells, Stephen Stills, Kim Pine and his sister Stacey urge him to break up with Knives but he delays. Scott arranges deliveries so Ramona must sign for packages and asks her out; after a snowstorm they shelter in Ramona’s apartment and begin to kiss, though Ramona refuses sex on their first date. At the Battle of the Bands, Scott is attacked by Matthew Patel, who announces himself as one of Ramona’s seven \"evil exes.\" Scott defeats Patel in a brief fight and Ramona explains that any new boyfriend must defeat all seven exes who control her love life.\n\nScott finally breaks up with Knives after she confesses love for him at her birthday dinner; Knives vows to win him back and begins imitating Ramona. The second evil ex, actor/skateboarder Lucas Lee, attacks Scott; Scott tricks Lucas into a fatal skateboard stunt and defeats him. The third ex, Todd Ingram—boyfriend of Scott’s ex Envy and a member of her band—uses telekinetic \"vegan\" powers to overpower Scott at a concert, but Scott and Sex Bob-Omb trick Todd into drinking coffee with cream, causing the Vegan Police to revoke his powers; Scott then kills Todd in battle. Scott fights Roxanne \"Roxy\" Richter, a former lesbian fling of Ramona’s, and Ramona intervenes to protect Scott; after Roxy’s defeat tensions rise as Scott becomes resentful of Ramona’s past and lashes out, so Ramona breaks up with him.\n\nDuring a later Battle of the Bands, Sex Bob-Omb faces the twin Katayanagi brothers (exes five and six) and defeats them, earning Scott an \"extra life.\" Scott returns home to find Sex Bob-Omb’s sponsor is Gideon Graves, who is revealed to be Ramona’s seventh and most powerful evil ex. The band signs Gideon’s record deal against Scott’s wishes; Scott leaves. Gideon invites Scott to the Chaos Theatre where Gideon formally confronts him. Scott challenges Gideon, gains a flimsy \"power of love\" sword which Gideon destroys, and then Knives storms the stage to fight Ramona. Scott tries to stop them and in the confusion confesses he cheated on both girls; Gideon kills Scott. In limbo, Ramona apologizes and reveals Gideon had implanted a subdermal device in her—Gideon used mind-control to keep exes in line. Scott uses his unused extra life to return to the moment before Gideon’s fatal blow.\n\nScott returns to the Chaos Theatre, reconciles with his friends, and fights Gideon again, this time earning the stronger \"power of self-respect\" sword. Scott apologizes to Ramona and Knives for his betrayals; Gideon intervenes, knocks Ramona down, and he, Scott and Knives team up to defeat Gideon. With Gideon destroyed and the mind-control broken, Ramona prepares to leave Toronto. Knives accepts that Scott is no longer hers and urges him to follow Ramona. Scott pursues Ramona, they reconcile honestly, and begin a relationship anew as Sex Bob-Omb continues playing and Scott moves forward having defeated the seven evil exes.",

      "in toronto, scott pilgrim (michael cera), a 22 year old bass guitarist for the band \"sex bob-omb\", begins dating a 17-year-old high-school student knives chau (ellen wong), much to the disapproval of his friends 22 years old stephen stills (mark webber), 23 years old kim pine (alison pill), 20 years old \"young\" neil nordegraf (johnny simmons), his roommate 25 years old wallace wells (kieran culkin), and his younger 18 years old sister stacey pilgrim (anna kendrick). knives and scott haven't even kissed each other yet and were far from having sex. they held hands together once and knives got embarrassed. it's been a year since scott was dumped by natalie. wallace is gay and is dating other scott (ben lewis). everyone is worried that scott is now dating a high-school student. julie powers (aubrey plaza) is a 23-year-old worker at a record store.\nscott imagines his life to be like a video-game, with every character having their title cards, displaying essential information along with their powers. scott meets an american girl, ramona flowers (mary elizabeth winstead), an american amazon delivery girl, who has been appearing in his dreams, and becomes obsessed with her. julie tells scott that ramona is out of his league. she is the coolest girl in town, has a boyfriend in new york, but had a big fight with him recently. julie says that ramona keeps mentioning a name gideon.\nscott loses interest in knives but does not break up with her before pursuing ramona. both wallace and stacey tell scott to break up with knives before going after ramona, but he ignores them. scott orders stuff from amazon so ramona has to come and deliver it. scott asks ramona out on a date, and she accepts else otherwise scott would not sign for the package. they end up in ramona's apartment due to a snowstorm and scott sleeps in her bed, though ramona changes her mind about having sex with scott on their first date. scott invites ramona to the battle of the bands.\nscott also receives an email from matthew patel challenging him to a duel. while playing in a battle of the bands sponsored by one \"g-man graves\" for a record deal, scott is attacked by matthew patel (satya bhabha), who introduces himself as the first of ramona's \"evil exes\". ramona & patel dated for a week and a half in 7th grade, post which ramona dumped him. scott defeats patel and learns from ramona that, in order for them to date, he must defeat all seven of her evil exes.\nramona and knives were both at the battle of the bands and knives kisses scott in front of ramona. while going home with scott on the bus, ramona admits that she is dating scott and agrees to make out with him. the next day, knives invites scott to her birthday dinner with her parents. knives says that she is in love with scott. scott finally breaks up with knives, who blames ramona and swears to win him back, by becoming more like ramona. scott battles ramona's second evil ex, popular actor and skateboarder lucas lee (chris evans), who he defeats by tricking him into performing a dangerous skateboard grind that causes him to ignite. scott later encounters the third evil ex, todd ingram (brandon routh), who is dating scott's ex-girlfriend, natalie \"envy\" adams (brie larson). envy is in a band herself and invites scott's band to open the show for them. todd is part of envy's band. todd initially overpowers scott using his psychic vegan abilities but is stripped of his powers by the vegan police after scott tricks him into drinking coffee with half and half cream, allowing scott to defeat him. scott begins to grow upset with ramona over her dating history by the defeat of the fourth ex, roxanne \"roxy\" richter (mae whitman). ramona had a brief lesbian fling with roxy before she dumped her & made her an \"evil ex\". when roxy attacks scott, ramona steps in to protect scott and defeat roxy.\nscott grows frustrated during the process, and after an outburst regarding ramona's dating history, she breaks up with him. during the second round of the battle of the bands, sex bob-omb faces off against the fifth and sixth evil exes, twin katayanagi brothers kyle (shota saito) and ken (keita saito), earning scott an extra life upon their defeat. during the battle, scott sees ramona together with her seventh evil ex, gideon graves (jason schwartzman), who turns out to be sex bob-omb's sponsor, g-man. the members of sex bob-omb accept gideon's record deal, except for scott, who leaves the band. upon returning home, scott receives a phone call invitation from gideon to his newly opened chaos theater where sex bob-omb is playing, claiming there to be \"no hard feelings\". scott arrives and challenges gideon to a fight, professing his love for ramona and gaining a sword called the \"power of love\", which gideon easily destroys. knives then crashes the scene to fight ramona over scott. scott goes to break up the girls' fight, only to accidentally reveal that he cheated on them with each other before he is killed by gideon. ramona visits scott in limbo and apologizes for getting him involved in her affairs, revealing that gideon had planted a mind control device in the back of her head. scott realizes he still has an extra life and uses it to return to life at the moment in time when gideon first called him. scott reenters the chaos theater where he makes peace with his friends and challenges gideon again, stating he is fighting for himself and gaining the much stronger \"power of self-respect\" sword with which he strikes down gideon. he then apologizes to ramona and knives for cheating on them, but gideon interferes and knocks down ramona, leading scott and knives to team up and defeat him. free from gideon's control, ramona prepares to leave, but knives accepts that her relationship with scott is over and encourages him to follow ramona. he does, and the two start their relationship anew."

I used to adore this sort of movie when I was a kid--&quot;Airplane,&quot; &quot;Top Secret,&quot; and the six-episode &quot;Police Squad&quot; show, which became the basis for the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; series, were among the funniest films I knew. When I first saw &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; in the theater when I was eleven, I was in uncontrollable laughter for the first few minutes. That was my standard of great humor at the time.<br/><br/>But the following decades gave us a variety of similar spoof films, some of which involved one or more of the Zucker-Abrams-Nielsen team, and none of these films were even remotely in the league of their predecessors. These included &quot;Hot Shots,&quot; &quot;Loaded Weapon 1,&quot; &quot;Jane Austen&#39;s Mafia,&quot; &quot;Spy Hard,&quot; &quot;Wrongfully Accused,&quot; and &quot;Scary Movie.&quot; These films would typically feature some funny stuff, but you&#39;d walk away indifferently, wondering what the overall point was. Seeing a ponytailed Leslie Nielsen imitating John Travolta&#39;s dance sequence in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is funny for a second, but there&#39;s nothing enduring about such humor. An entire movie filled with such scenes doesn&#39;t amount to much. What&#39;s the big deal about such jokes, anyway? There&#39;s nothing intrinsically funny about making references to other films, even if you do it in a silly way. At what point did the genre go wrong and become such a dreary, uninspired affair? Is it that I&#39;ve just outgrown this sort of humor?<br/><br/>I have another theory. When I first watched &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; at age eleven, I had not seen many of the movies it was spoofing, such as the early James Bond pictures. I was vaguely familiar with some of the clichés it was making fun of, but many of the political and sexual jokes went right over my head. And the celebrity cameos meant nothing to me. So what was it about the film that appealed to me so much, that made me laugh till my sides hurt?<br/><br/>The answer is simple: it was the film&#39;s utter silliness. Think of the scene at the beginning when we discover that Ayatollah Khomeini secretly sports a mohawk underneath his turban. Or the opening credits where the police car goes on the sidewalk, inside buildings, on a roller coaster, and so on. None of this makes any sense, of course; it&#39;s just an exercise in pure absurdity. I loved &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; for pretty much the same reason I loved the Three Stooges or Bugs Bunny cartoons. Even as an adult, I appreciate unsubtle cartoon humor when it is handled effectively. As long as it makes me laugh, who cares that it&#39;s not &quot;sophisticated&quot;? For example, the scene where Lt. Drebin breaks into a building and tries to be as quiet as possible, but then inadvertently sets off a player piano, is masterfully filmed.<br/><br/>Thus, &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; is farce as much as it is satire. As I grew older, I would gain a greater appreciation for the one-liners, like &quot;You take a chance getting up in the morning, crossing the street or sticking your face in a fan.&quot; To be sure, many of these jokes are dumb. They&#39;re supposed to be. That&#39;s the whole point. What I understood even at age eleven was that the movie was essentially playing games with the audience. When Lt. Drebin looks in a drawer and says &quot;bingo,&quot; I knew immediately that the drawer would reveal a bingo board. I was used to this sort of humor, because I&#39;d seen it in the earlier Zucker-Abrams films, where the jokes had a definite logic to them, and trying to predict them in advance was part of the fun. They have far more to do with audience anticipation than with trying to make us laugh at bad puns.<br/><br/>The modern spoof films have forgotten all this. They&#39;ve forgotten that making a good spoof requires a measure of invention, even if much of the plot is ripped off from elsewhere. Car chases may not be original, but &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; is, as far as I know, the first film in which the chase is conducted by a student driver. This type of cleverness is largely absent from the modern spoofs, which assume that they have no reason to be creative when their ideas are based broadly on other films. They&#39;ve forgotten that the most effective way to make fun of a cliché is by coming up with an ingenious twist. Even the characters in films like these matter, and Lt. Drebin is crafted in the grand tradition of other inept lawmen like Inspector Clousseau. This is what gives the film its own personal stamp that makes it more than an exercise in movie references."

        "text": "The movie itself is funny.  &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; is without a doubt the best skewering of all cop movie cliches available in this day and age.  It works on every conceivable level and a few that haven&#39;t been conceived yet.<br/><br/>But what puts it over the top is Leslie Nielsen.<br/><br/>It&#39;s amazing: he was great in &quot;Airplane!&quot;, another classic from the ZAZ team (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), and in the lamentably short TV series &quot;Police Squad!&quot;.  But here, he spreads his wings and flies to new heights of insanity and delerium.  With jaw set square and tongue firmly in cheek, Neilsen makes the role of Lt. Frank Drebin all his own and the movie-going public&#39;s collective life is all the more enriched because of it.<br/><br/>He&#39;s aided and abetted by greats like Kennedy, Presley and Montalban (who knew?) and the movie even finds good moments for John Houseman and Reggie Jackson.  <br/><br/>As I said, the movie takes off and finds great things to do with police cars with a mind all their own and goes on from there to take on such cliches as car chases, illegal searches, the cleaning out of the desk, the trip to the police lab, shoot-outs, the lax housework of a single police detective, etc., etc., etc.....<br/><br/>And what other cop movie in the history of the world has a music video in the middle, courtesy of Herman&#39;s Hermits?<br/><br/>Just one.<br/><br/>Ten stars and a Dugout Dog for &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, the film that answers once and for all - can Leslie Nielsen do comedy?<br/><br/>I think you know the answer."

This is one of those movies in which you can go crazy by trying to count the gags in the first ten minutes. Airplane did disaster films, this one does police dramas.<br/><br/>Frank Drebin (Leslie Neilsen) is a respected cop with gravel for a brain. He is part of a police force called Police Squad, who the security of Queen Elizabeth has just been handed to for her visit to Los Angeles. Frank bumbles through several hilarious scenarios in trying to foil an assassination attempt on her, and catch the attempted murderer of his best friend Nordberg (OJ Simpson). Meanwhile, he starts going out with the beautiful Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley).<br/><br/>This movie goes from one hilarious situation to another, from commandeering a car that&#39;s being used for a drivers test, to trying to save a valuable pen from a fish tank. Leslie Neilsen&#39;s comedic timing is brilliant. His facial expressions during the slapstick sequences are priceless, as are his dead-seriousness of delivering one liners. Some of his quotes are so hilarious, that I have trouble figuring out how he could have possibly kept a straight face during filming. This is another classic in the same style as Airplane, which means hilarity. This gets a 9/10.<br/><br/>It is rated PG-13 for Crude and Sexual Humor, and for Some Language.

        "text": "Fresh from tackling terrorism in Beruit, with his own unique hands on style, Lt Frank Drebin is immediately called onto the job to investigate the near fatal shooting of a fellow officer. Det Nordberg was gunned down investigating a case in the docks and Drebin&#39;s investigation begins with the company that Nordberg was undercover with  that of pillar of the community Vincent Ludwig. As Frank falls for Ludwig&#39;s PA, the beautiful Jane Spencer, he uncovers proof of a dastardly plot by Ludwig  but who will believe him?<br/><br/>If there is a man, woman or child on this earth who can say, hand on heart, that they just don&#39;t find Airplane, Naked Gun, Police Squad and the like funny then I would very much like to meet the sad sack just to discover what it takes to elicit a smile from them. Needless to say, this sort of film is very much my type of thing but not to the point where I cannot spot a good one from a bad one. In fact one of the big downsides of this film is that it did create many copies that just couldn&#39;t do it as well  so we have had spoofs of all sorts of genres recently, but too many have more hits than misses.<br/><br/>It is to this films credit that it has a very high hit/miss ratio and I enjoy it so much because the laughs keep coming. The material is very silly but it is the constant straight face that it delivers it with that is perfect and makes it work. Other films of the ilk have been overly silly without keeping this straight face. However, our characters here seem oblivious  apart from the odd one who gives the other a funny look etc, and this makes the goings on even funnier. The plot is silly but that doesn&#39;t matter as you will be laughing too much to really care. Having seen it so often I have stopped roaring the way I did the first time but I still chuckled all the way.<br/><br/>The writing and direction is spot on  delivering sharp lines that make me laugh due to their sheer unexpectedness or the way they are so very out of place as well as sight gags that are imaginative and clever. However lets not forget a delivery by a very talented cast who make the material work. Praise goes to Nielsen in the lead; he may have worn his role thin over the years with typecasting and, shall we say &#39;less than perfect&#39; material but give him the tools and he&#39;ll do you a job. He can be straight, he can dither or he can just be a clown and he does them all here  his delivery is great whether it&#39;s action or reaction shots. Likewise I felt the rest of the cast did well even if most of them are given reaction shots to Drebin. Presley is straight and funny for it while Kennedy seems to fit into the material with ease. OJ doesn&#39;t have as much chance to be funny and seems a little stiff in the scenes he is in, but he is still good  just pales a little when next to the others. I love Montalban and he uses his ooze really well in this film  and his reaction shots are very good. The support is all good but it is Nielsen doing his (now) time-honoured turn as spoof-master than steals the show.<br/><br/>Overall I love this genre and consider this film (indeed the series) to be up there with Police Squad and Airplane. It is not as hilarious as Airplane but it has way more hits than misses and is relentlessly funny. As a film it isn&#39;t perfect but anyone watching this who complains about plot holes, lack of character development or lack of narrative really have missed the point."

Here, he&#39;s trying to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth.

Back in Los Angeles, detective Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) attempts to bust a heroin deal at the docks linked to wealthy developer Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban) and is shot by Ludwig’s henchmen; Nordberg survives but is hospitalized. Captain Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) briefs Drebin and gives him 24 hours to clear Nordberg’s name amid police suspicion Nordberg was corrupt. Drebin consults police scientist Ted Olsen, who demonstrates a knockout cuff-link dart. Drebin visits Ludwig’s office, learns Ludwig is a respected developer, and inadvertently reveals Nordberg is alive, prompting an assassination attempt on Nordberg by a hypnotized physician; Drebin pursues the assassin in a teen-driving-school car through Los Angeles until the car crashes spectacularly. Drebin meets Ludwig’s assistant Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) and falls for her; Jane is unaware of Ludwig’s crimes. Pahpshmir (an intermediary) meets Ludwig and reveals Ludwig’s plan to sell a $20 million assassination contract on Queen Elizabeth II; Ludwig demonstrates a post-hypnotic trigger delivered via a beeper that can turn anyone into an unwitting assassin. Drebin breaks into Ludwig’s office to find evidence, accidentally sets it on fire, and later confronts Ludwig at a reception where Ludwig appears to try to assassinate the Queen; Drebin’s intervention gets him removed from Police Squad. While the Queen visits Los Angeles to attend a California Angels vs. Seattle Mariners baseball game, Jane tells Drebin that Ludwig has brainwashed an Angels right fielder—Reggie Jackson—to be the assassin using the beeper trigger. Drebin, hiding from police orders to arrest him, disguises himself as opera singer Enrico Palazzo and then secures the home-plate umpire position to search players for weapons and delay the game. Ludwig activates Jackson with the beeper; Jackson attempts to shoot the Queen during a bench-clearing brawl but Drebin fires Olsen’s cuff-link dart to incapacitate Jackson and instead hits a spectator; a fat woman falls onto Jackson and knocks him out, saving the Queen. Ludwig kidnaps Jane and takes her to the top of the stadium at gunpoint. Drebin reaches the top; he shoots Ludwig with the cuff-link dart, Ludwig staggers and falls over the stadium railing and lands under the marching band, which triggers Ludwig’s beeper and—through a post-hypnotic link—compels Jane to try to shoot Drebin. Drebin breaks Jane’s hypnosis by professing love, proposing with an engagement ring, and reverse-psychology; Jane snaps out of the suggestion and accepts. The stadium scoreboard broadcasts Drebin’s speech, prompting mass reconciliation among players and fans. Mayor Barkley reinstates Drebin to Police Squad; Nordberg congratulates him, but when Drebin pats Nordberg he accidentally sends him tumbling over the railing in a final gag.",

      "in beirut, lebanon, a gang of anti-american leaders including ayatollah khomeini, mikhail gorbachev, yasser arafat, muammar gaddafi, fidel castro, and idi amin meet to plan the ultimate terrorist act against the united states. the man who is later shown to be pahpshmir is also present. frank drebin (leslie nielsen) has been posing undercover as a waiter; he beats up all the attendees, revealing that gorbachev is an impostor and various other shocking facts about them in the process, and warns them that they will never attack america as long as he is on the job. in los angeles, officer nordberg (o.j. simpson) unsuccessfully attempts to bust a heroin drug operation at the docks organized by vincent ludwig (ricardo montalban) and is shot numerous times by ludwig's henchmen. after being briefed on the case by his colleague and friend, captain ed hocken (george kennedy), frank visits nordberg in the hospital. nordberg can provide only a few cryptic clues, including a picture of ludwig's ship on which the deal had been organized. frank later meets with wacky police scientist named ted olsen (ed williams), who has invented a cuff-link that shoots out a tiny dart which renders the victim unconscious, promptly testing it on hocken. while discussing nordberg's case, it is revealed that the police force suspects nordberg to be corrupt and involved in drug dealings. hocken gives drebin 24 hours to clear nordberg's name. pahpshmir meets with ludwig, who announces that he will assassinate queen elizabeth ii (jeannette charles) for $20 million. with his beeper used as an acoustic trigger, ludwig demonstrates that he has a way of turning anyone into an unknowing assassin via the post-hypnotic suggestion. later, drebin visits ludwig in his office and inadvertently lets slip the information that nordberg is still alive, which results in an assassination attempt by a hypnotized physician. frank chases the assassin in a commandeered teen driving school car until the luckless fugitive crashes the car into a gasoline truck, a u.s. army missile transporter, and-riding astride the missile-a fireworks factory. as drebin works on the case, he meets and falls in love with ludwig's assistant, jane spencer (priscilla presley). it is eventually revealed that she knows nothing about ludwig's plot, and after jane learns of her employer's villainy, she helps frank with his investigation. however, things go awry as frank breaks into ludwig's office to get crucial information. in the process of finding that information, frank ends up setting a fire that completely destroys ludwig's office. later, to make things worse, after frank accidentally sees ludwig appear to make an outright assassination attempt on the queen at a reception, frank ends up causing more trouble and is removed from police squad. during the queen's visit to a california angels baseball game, jane tells frank that one of the team's players will conduct the assassination. while hiding from his fellow policemen, who are now under orders to arrest him, frank first attempts to disguise himself as the opera singer enrico pallazzo, brutally mangling the u.s. national anthem along the way, and manages to secure the position of the home plate umpire and begins calling the game while simultaneously frisking all players for weapons. finally, realizing that he is running out of time, frank goes to great lengths to delay the game, ultimately resorting to interfering with the play to the ire of the managers of the mariners and the angels. ludwig activates his 'sleeper', the right-fielder for the angels, reggie jackson. jane alerts frank, who chases after jackson. jackson catches and tackles him, inadvertently triggering a bench-clearing brawl between the angels and their opponent, the seattle mariners, while ludwig takes jane to the top of the stadium at gunpoint. during the brawl, jackson emerges from the pile and points his gun at the queen. however, frank fires one of ted's cuff-link darts to incapacitate jackson, but accidentally hits a fat woman in the upper mezzanine instead. still, frank manages to save the queen's life, because the dazed fat woman falls on top of jackson, knocking him out. frank later moves through the crowd to the top of the stadium, where ludwig holds jane at gunpoint. frank shot ludwig with the other cuff-link dart, causing ludwig to stagger and fall several stories over the stadium's railing. the usc marching band tromps over ludwig's steamroller-flattened body, triggering his beeper and thus activating jane's own post-hypnotic suggestion, which compels her to kill frank with ludwig's gun. frank uses his reverse psychology to try and break jane's hypnotized state by openly professing his feelings for her, and gives her an engagement ring, after which jane is freed from ludwig's hypnosis and finally accepts frank's marriage proposal. frank's speech is broadcast on the stadium screen, causing the teams and the audience to burst into tears, fall into each other's arms and make up. afterwards, frank and jane meet mayor barkley (nancy marchand), who reinstates frank back to police squad, and nordberg congratulates him. nordberg, while still on wheelchair-bound, seems much better until frank pats nordberg on the back, accidentally sending him toppling down the aisle and up over the railing of the stadium's upper deck."
