      "In 1981 Savannah, Georgia, Forrest Gump sits on a bus-stop bench and tells strangers his life story. He begins with childhood in Greenbow, Alabama (born to Mrs. Gump), where he wears leg braces and is bullied. He befriends Jenny Curran on the school bus; Jenny teaches him to read and encourages him to run. When his braces break while fleeing bullies, Forrest discovers he can run extremely fast and earns a football scholarship to the University of Alabama, playing under Coach Bear Bryant and meeting Governor George Wallace and student Vivian Malone during integration. After college Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army (1967). In basic training he befriends Benjamin \"Bubba\" Blue, who plans a shrimping business with Forrest. In Vietnam Forrest repeatedly saves fellow soldiers and is wounded; Bubba is killed. Forrest carries wounded men to safety, including Lieutenant Dan Taylor, who loses both legs and resents Forrest for saving him. Forrest receives the Medal of Honor from President Lyndon B. Johnson and is sent home for recovery, where he learns and excels at ping-pong, later touring China as part of ping-pong diplomacy and meeting public figures (including John Lennon and President Richard Nixon). Forrest intermittently reunites with Jenny: she lives a turbulent life of abuse, drug use, and the 1960s counterculture; she scorns Forrest's naive love but briefly rekindles their relationship several times. Forrest invests the ping-pong and endorsement money to buy a shrimp boat in Bayou La Batre to fulfill Bubba's dream; after Hurricane Carmen destroys much of the fleet, Forrest and Lieutenant Dan's boat survives and they harvest vast quantities of shrimp, founding the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. Lieutenant Dan, initially bitter, eventually accepts his changed fate and becomes Forrest's business partner; he invests in Apple and they become wealthy. Forrest returns home to care for his dying mother, who dies of cancer. Jenny returns in 1976; she and Forrest spend a night together, she becomes pregnant, and then leaves. Heartbroken, Forrest runs across America for three years before stopping and returning to Greenbow. In 1981 Jenny contacts Forrest; she brings their son, Forrest Jr., and reveals she is ill (implied hepatitis C). They marry; Jenny dies shortly after, and Forrest raises their son, walking him to his first day of school as the film ends.\n",

      "Plot Summary: In 1981 Savannah, Georgia, Forrest Gump sits on a bus-stop bench and recounts his life. Born in 1944 in Greenbow, Alabama, Forrest (Tom Hanks) grows up with leg braces and an IQ of 75. His mother (Mrs. Gump) runs a boarding house and teaches him self-respect. On the school bus he befriends Jenny Curran; they become inseparable childhood friends. Bullies chase Forrest; when his leg braces break he discovers he can run extremely fast. His running wins him a football scholarship to the University of Alabama, where he meets coach Bear Bryant and once returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone during Governor George Wallace's 1963 “schoolhouse door” standoff. After college in 1967 Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army. In basic he befriends Benjamin \"Bubba\" Blue, who teaches him about shrimping; they ship to Vietnam with Lieutenant Dan Taylor as their platoon leader. In Vietnam their unit is ambushed: Bubba is killed, Forrest carries several wounded soldiers to safety and is wounded by a bullet in the buttocks. Lt. Dan loses both legs and is embittered; Forrest receives a battlefield promotion and later witnesses Dan receive the Medal of Honor from President Lyndon B. Johnson. Forrest recuperates in a hospital, learns ping-pong and becomes a ping-pong celebrity, representing the U.S. in diplomatic matches and appearing on television with John Lennon. After discharge he returns to Greenbow briefly, then to New York where he reunites with Jenny at an anti-war rally; she is living a countercultural, self-destructive life. Forrest gives Jenny his Medal of Honor and repeatedly professes his love, but she pushes him away. Using money from a ping-pong endorsement, Forrest buys a shrimp boat in Bayou La Batre to fulfill Bubba's dream. He and Lt. Dan form the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company; after Hurricane Carmen their luck changes, they haul in massive catches, become successful and invest in Apple, making them wealthy. Forrest donates half the profits to Bubba's family. Back home his mother dies of cancer. In 1976 Jenny returns briefly; she and Forrest sleep together, she tells him she loves him, then leaves. Forrest runs across the country for three years in a publicized cross-country trek, then stops and returns to Greenbow. In 1981 he receives a letter from Jenny asking him to visit; she has a young son, Forrest Jr., whom she reveals is Forrest's child. Jenny is sick (implied hepatitis C); she and Forrest marry, move to Greenbow, and she dies a year later. Forrest raises their son and walks him to his first day of school, sitting on the same bench where his story began.\n",
