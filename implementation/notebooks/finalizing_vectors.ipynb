Their parents take them to the trolls led by Grand Pabbie, who heal Anna and erase her memories of magic but warn that Elsa must learn to control her power. The royal family isolates the girls; Elsa is taught to suppress emotion and wear gloves, growing fearful and withdrawn, while Anna becomes lonely. Years later, at Elsa\\'s coronation, Anna meets Prince Hans of the Southern Isles and impulsively becomes engaged to him. When Anna presses Elsa about the sudden engagement, Elsa panics, loses control, and reveals her powers to the crowd. Elsa flees across the frozen fjord; her uncontrolled magic plunges Arendelle into an eternal winter. Anna volunteers to find Elsa and restore summer. She travels north, buying supplies at Wandering Oaken\\'s and recruiting ice harvester Kristoff and his reindeer Sven after paying for Kristoff\\'s gear. They are joined by the living snowman Olaf, whom Elsa inadvertently animated. The trio reach Elsa\\'s ice palace; Anna pleads with Elsa to return, but Elena, frightened, accidentally strikes Anna in the heart with magic and summons a giant snow guard (Marshmallow) to drive them away. Kristoff takes the weakening Anna to the trolls. Grand Pabbie diagnoses Anna\\'s heart as frozen and says only an \"act of true love\" can thaw it; they assume a love\\'s kiss from Hans will save her. Kristoff races Anna back to Arendelle while Hans organizes the palace and the Duke of Weselton plots to kill Elsa. Hans confronts Elsa on the frozen fjord, seemingly fights Marshmallow and prevents guards from shooting her; Elsa is captured after a chandelier knocks her unconscious and taken back to Arendelle and imprisoned. Kristoff reaches Anna and brings her to the castle; Anna begs Hans to kiss her but he refuses and later reveals he never loved her — he plans to let Anna die and then kill Elsa to claim the throne. Hans falsely accuses Elsa of murder and prepares to execute her. Elsa breaks free, escapes into the blizzard and races back toward Arendelle as a massive storm engulfs the kingdom. Kristoff returns with Sven; Olaf locates Anna. On the palace ramparts Hans draws his sword to kill Elsa; Anna, still partly frozen, throws herself between them and is turned to solid ice as the sword would have struck her. Elsa, grief-stricken, sheds the emotional restraint that blocked her power; Anna\\'s sacrifice — an act of true love — thaws her. Realizing love, Elsa dispels the winter and restores summer. Olaf is protected by a small personal snow flurry Elsa maintains. Hans is arrested and sent back to the Southern Isles as punishment; the Duke of Weselton is sidelined.
