As German forces conquer Poland, his FAMILY is deported and he is forced into the Warsaw ghetto; later, during mass deportations, he is separated from his relatives. With the help of friends, he hides first in a friend\u0019s apartment, then moves through a sequence of abandoned homes and hidden rooms as occupying forces tighten control, performing privately to survive and smuggle food while his FAMILY suffers and is sent to concentration camps. After a revolt and the destruction of the city, PROTAGONIST endures years of starvation and illness, moving between hiding places until he is discovered by a German captain, PERSON_2, who, recognizing his pianism, shelters him and provides food and an attic refuge. As the city burns and the Red Army advances, PROTAGONIST\u0019s hideout eventually collapses, but PERSON_2\u0019s support helps him endure.
