# Movie Semantic Vectors Overview

This table describes the full set of vectors used to represent movie objects for semantic search.

| **Plot Analysis** | What the movie is about thematically and conceptually (core heart, ideas, lessons learned) |
| **Viewer Experience** | What it feels like to watch the movie and how it emotionally lands during and shortly after viewing |
| **Watch Context** | What motivates someone to choose this movie and the situations it fits into |
| **Narrative Techniques** | Meta analysis of the storytelling techniques, structures, and devices the movie uses |
